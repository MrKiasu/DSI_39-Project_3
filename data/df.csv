2,Anxious People on this subreddit: stop abandoning yourself and blaming it on someone else,"If you’re anxious preoccupied or anxious leaning whatever, by hyperfocusing on everyone else, figuring out an avoidant, dissecting someone else’s brain, spending all your time researching THEM, you’re abandoning and avoiding yourself. 

Every time you choose to not voice a need in fear they’ll run, YOU are abandoning YOURSELF. Sticking around repeatedly after your voiced needs aren’t being met? Choosing to stick around for someone who has been ignoring you for months? YOU are abandoning YOURSELF. You can make it about the avoidant’s attachment style all you want but then you’re being avoidant to yourself all over again. Double whammy. There really are so many avoidants in the world when you factor in self avoidant anxious + other avoidant attached people! The very thing you’re angry about them doing, you’re doing to yourself too. 

Every time you make yourself fit whatever contortion you’ve decided will “keep them” or “get them back,” YOU are abandoning YOURSELF. 

It’s highly probable (though there are some rare exceptions) that whatever abandonment you are fearing is probably related to something that happened to you before you even met the person you’re so worried about right now. Focus on that. Show up for yourself. Untangle that web of your own trauma instead of posting the timeline of your ex’s entire life and trauma history so you can get “closure” from a bunch of strangers. Get help from a professional to help stitch up your own wounds. You know what the flight attendants tell you before the flight takes off - if the oxygen masks drop, put on yours first before helping someone else. 

Even if someone leaves you, you need to be there for yourself. You have to fill your cup up at least half way. How do you expect others to show up for you when you can’t even do that for yourself? How do you expect to attract an emotionally available partner when you’re not emotionally available yourself? 

Ignoring yourself ends up being a double abandonment which is why it probably feels so catastrophic to you. Take some pointers from avoidants and learn how to sit alone with yourself for a little bit, detach a bit, keep other hobbies, friends and interests so if the “worst” happens, you’ll still have YOU and whatever or whoever else was there all along. 

The posts where you decide you’re finally going to wave the white flag after months or years after a breakup…my goodness. Desperately trying to understand someone who doesn’t want you to understand them or who doesn’t even understand themselves? Trying to be in a relationship with someone who says and shows they don’t want one? Chasing and chasing and obsessing and self abandonment and being a martyr doesn’t deserve some badge of honor, sorry. I wish people would stop romanticizing that. It can be just as toxic as anything an avoidant would do. 

The work on attachment is mending yourself, not obsessing over someone else. How do you mend yourself when all of your needles and thread are stuck in someone else? The mind reading posts - that’s not working on yourself, that’s filling up the codependency tank. You’re still trying to make yourself feel better through the other person, using strangers as a supply if your desired supply isn’t accessible. Seriously- stop making everything about us. Get the help for yourself that you are so concerned and sure the avoidant should get. 

If you want your life to change, CHANGE, don’t do the same old shit you’ve been doing for years, but now under a disguise of knowing about attachment theory now. You can read all about it and cite facts from memory but none of that matters if you aren’t going to look within and be there for yourself.",plr9xd,439,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/plr9xd/anxious_people_on_this_subreddit_stop_abandoning/,AvoidantAttachment,0

6,"Can we talk about how painful it is as a {da} to see you're hurting the person you care about, but still be too empty and blocked inside to offer them what they need?","This is ridiculous. I didn't ask to be this way, I'm trying the best I can to change it and I still end up just hurting the only people who are willing to withstand my bullshit.

My gf was away for 5 days. I prepped the house for her arrival, cleaned everything and bought her some flowers, left a note with a heart (she was coming home earlier then me that day). When we finally met, we started chatting a bit how her trip was etc. and then she asked me if I missed her.

I said 'yea'. She's like 'only yea? or did you really miss me?' I answered, I guess in a cold tone, 'I missed you'. And then before I know it, it turned once again into an argument about how I don't love her and she's not even getting the bare emotional minimum, me always being cold and unhappy, her feeling unwanted.

And the thing is, I couldn't say I really missed her, because I didn't. When she was away, I did feel lonely and was texting with her etc., but I also felt very much free and safe, able to just be. And after all the yesterday, I know she'll be invalidated and looking for even some show of affection, while I literally feel empty and have to put my entire energy into not deactivating completely and only proving her point further.

I could write a book about how much it sucks to be stuck in this paradox. About how frustrating it is to be putting all of this work into changing, and yet the patterns still persisting, making me feel hopeless and pitiful. And then also having to take the blame for hurting your close ones and desperately trying not to feel like a horrible person for it.

21,I reached out to my ex to apologize for me being avoidant,"I practically forced my ex to break up with me due to my avoidant traits. It got so bad and I was so overwhelmed that I began to check out of the relationship. I didn’t know why but I just needed to be alone. She noticed that and eventually ended it with me. 

It wasn’t until after the breakup did I realize that I was avoidant. I looked into attachment theory and it destroyed me when I realized the implications of my attachment style. Everything suddenly clicked and I couldn’t help but need to reach out to my ex to make sure she knew it wasn’t her fault for how I was. To let her know her reasons were valid. She wasn’t asking too much of me at all. While she is anxiously attached, I brought out the worst in her. 

She actually responded and told me how she’s been waiting for me to tell her that for months. She’s with someone else now but at least she knows that I hold no ill feelings and can own up to how I was. I can’t blame everything on our attachment styles clashing, or me being avoidant, but it didn’t help one bit.

Now I’m alone again knowing I probably won’t be able to keep a relationship alive until I fix myself and move towards a more secure attachment. She loved me so much that she was the one trying her hardest to make it work. It kills me knowing that I had to ruin a relationship to want to change for the better. After it was over for good between us did I realize I really miss her. The whole experience was one of the toughest lessons I’ve had in my life.

24,I hate how people view avoidant attachment,"Look, as an avoidant I know that my actions and behavior can be shitty - and it is something I do genuinely think I need to work on - but I hate how people view those with avoidant attachments as inherently assholes, rather than recognizing many of us are victims of abuse and neglect, and it's often a symptom of mental illness and/or neurodivergency.

Like yes, an avoidant attachment can hurt people, I'm not going to pretend it doesn't, but nothing I do with my avoidant attachment makes me inherently an asshole. I don't sit here and think ""hm, yes, i am intentionally going to ignore this person"" ... it is a symptom. 

I'm sure some avoidants can be assholes, but there's assholes in every type of group. My ex had a clingy, anxious attachment, and they ended up being a stalker, but I'm not going to say every single person with an anxious attachment is a stalker or a creep. 

It just sucks, honestly. Like I really try not to be an asshole with my attachment style, and I've worked hard to try and ""fix"" it - but I wish more people actually understood what it is like, rather than assuming we're all shitty.

29,Letter from a Dismissive Avoidant {DA},"Hi everyone,

I am currently working on my master's to become a therapist. Part of the process was for me to go through my own long-term therapy. I've been going weekly for over a year and have made a lot of progress.

When I started therapy, I was convinced I had a secure attachment style. However, slowly, I came to the realization that I have had a DA style. My therapist asked if I would write a letter to my mom, who is also DA. When I sat down to write, I got maybe a paragraph in and just could not do it. I kept feeling like I was being melodramatic and whiney.

Fast forward 1.2 years later, therapy helped me find the strength to do it. The trick was to tell myself to lean into those feelings and just accept the cringiness of the letter. I told myself no one was ever going to see it anyways. This allowed me to let it all out, and it's helped my therapy immensely.

I wanted to post it on this subreddit for multiple reasons. 1. I'm hoping that letting others see this will encourage me to let my defenses down in my future relationships and accept vulnerability. 2. I hope that others with a DA style can relate to the letter and see they are not alone. 3. I wanted to show that therapy does help and progress is possible. 4. I hope this letter can show others what goes on in the mind of a DA, and help them see the humanity behind the dismissiveness.

This letter was really for me, and I don't think ill ever give it to my mom. However, feedback is greatly appreciated, and I am happy to answer any questions about the letter. Also, it's a bit long, but the double spacing makes it look even longer.

30,{DA} Vilification of avoidants and lack of taking responsibility by other styles in many spaces,"This gets so exhausting. From popular resources like Attached through pop-psych Facebook reels(and the comments under them) to attachment style boards, the prevalent attitude seems to be ""Avoidants are messed up, just stay away from them and find someone who doesn't trigger your anxiety"".

Which...yeah, avoidants are messed up. And we don't deny it. Any time I see a comment by an avoidant, it's basically an admission of guilt and acknowledgement of things they need to fix. Myself, I've never denied I have shit I need to work on.

But you know, so do APs. And I see those admissions much less frequently.

Whenever I read attachment style threads, it seems to be the same thing.

An avoidant always has to want space because they're incapable of closeness, or haven't healed, or don't realize they're deactivating etc. etc  - basically all reasons related to their internal issues. It couldn't possibly be that protest behaviors, blaming and guilt trips played a part in pushing them away.

An AP/DA relationship is failing because ""an avoidant not getting treatment is incapable of relationships"". Okay, true so far. But zero mention of the anxious person needing treatment, too.

It just seems so maddeningly one-sided and echo-chambery. The general attitude seems to be ""avoidants are the REAL problem, anxious people are fine if someone would just love them the right way"".

And that just fucking sucks to keep hearing as an avoidant trying to do work. Yes, I know I need to fix things about myself, won't argue there. I've done some work, got quite a bit left. At the same time, I've spent enough time with an AP and read enough about AT to know that the dynamic flows both ways and that the AP hurts and triggers the avoidant just as much. So this constant hammering that I'm the only one who needs to change is so frustrating and invalidating.",125lfa9,165,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/125lfa9/da_vilification_of_avoidants_and_lack_of_taking/,AvoidantAttachment,0

36,"{da} I just read ‘Attached’, and now my life makes sense","The chapter on Avoidance feels like it was written by someone inside my head. 

1. I used to have a slight obsession with independence and ‘getting away from society’, I’d frequently talk about wanting to go and live in the woods and never come back, or buying some land in the middle of nowhere and living as a hermit. I moved out of my parents house at 16 to live by myself because I wanted that independence (they were/are great parents, I just felt stifled at home)

2. In my previous (and only) relationship, I’d frequently distance myself and get concerned we were too close, and that I was “leading her on” in some way. I was terrified that she ‘needed me’ and I was going to be stuck in this relationship forever.

3. This manifested itself in me turning up late whenever we hung out, being overly secretive, keeping very separate friend groups and social lives, dropping ‘joking’ hints that I wasn’t that interested in getting married, etc.

4. Reminiscing about the ‘freedom’ I enjoyed when single (which I actually hated), and thinking I could probably get someone better.

5. Not committing to things like vacations together, in-case we did break up

6. Lack of physical closeness - she wanted sex far more than I did, and frequently told me that whenever I didn’t want it, it made her feel unattractive (while I had a secret porn addiction)

7. Always looking for the worst in her, and thinking I was ‘better’ than her.

8. Since we broke up, I’ve spent the past year pining for her, realising what I missed and how brilliant she was - I can’t even remember what annoyed me about her - but I’ve not done anything about it because I’m concerned I’ll just waste her time and do the exact same thing again. (Phantom Ex)

9. I have very little interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with anyone else, I go on 2-3 dates and get bored and tell them it’s not working out

I’ve never felt so understood in my life. It’s refreshing to know that while I was a poor boyfriend, it’s a common and understood phenomenon, and perhaps I can stop beating myself up about it and start working to better myself. I don’t quite know what to do with this newfound information yet, but I’m convinced it will lead to some big changes in my life.",tycjnb,134,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tycjnb/da_i_just_read_attached_and_now_my_life_makes/,AvoidantAttachment,0

39,"I'm horrified by Instagram characterizations of avoidants. I can't even find an empathetic account to follow (although there are a few overal ""attachment"" accounts that are okay). Recs? (and a bit of a lament, if not a full rant)","I like to follow Instagram accounts for personal benefit, and was recently scrolling the comments of an attachment styles/therapist post. 

Y'all, I had no IDEA the public vitriol harbored towards Avoidants. Having only encountered it in a caring therapy context and objective books, I just assumed everyone recognized it as something painful and confusing to the traumatized person experiencing it. 

NOPE. I honestly could. not. believe. the nastiness towards avoidants. I had no idea I was perceived as cold and uncaring, especially since I consider myself an extraordinarily sensitive person. 

What's worse, as I scanned for attachment accounts, I saw reassurance after reassurance towards anxious attachers. Things like, ""we love to see your passion in relationships!"" ""No one cares like you do!"" ""You're tireless and loyal!"" It felt like validating behavior that—while a valid sign of trauma—needs to be changed, not cheered. And I admit, I was saddened to see there's no such reassurance for avoidants. Every account seemed to be dedicated to, well, avoiding us. 

First of all, I need some comfort. It really sucked to read that this behavior that has mystified and plagued me, and that I've worked hard to override and change, that I never CHOSE, is basically shelved under ""asshole."" It sucked to see NONE of the comforting warmth directed at anxious types beamed towards avoidants. And the unmitigated ranting...while I certainly have some not so great opinions of various anxious types who blew holes through MY life, I just don't see that kind of vitriol directed at anxious people. 

It feels unbalanced and unfair. ALL insecure attachment types got that way through not fun means, and no one is doing it on purpose. Most of us are looking at this content so we can do better...or so I thought. It feels like some people just look at it to confirm their exes were ""terrible."" 

Anyway...are there any pro-avoidant instagram accounts that help us grow and learn? I found a few ""general"" attachment accounts, but the advice for avoidants is pretty thin.

41,I've been repeating my avoidant patterns for 20 years now and don't know if I will be able to change. {da},"I just got dumped by my girlfriend of 18 months. Even though I found the Attached book and read it about 3 years ago and vowed things would be different this time, it was the same old story. Met an amazing girl who is loving and caring and truly one of the strongest and secure people that I've met. 

I fell madly in love with her. At the beginning I really tried making it work. I journaled about her, and made a gratitude list about her. But then around 6 months in I started noticing things that I don't like about her. Little things. But in my mind they were dealbreakers.

So I detached. I was emotionally distant and unavailable. I wasn't as into the sex anymore and would fantasize about other women or exes during our intimate times.

I convinced myself she wasn't the one. I compared her to my Phantom exes in my mind constantly.

She broke up with me twice before because she saw through my bullshit, but I was able to beg and plead for her to come back. The third time did not work and she has left me for good now. And now all I can think about is how perfect she was for me, and her good qualities.

I'm not a young guy. I'm 37. This is literally the 10th time this has happened to me and I'm tired of it. Even when I'm aware of my issues, it's the exact same cycle. Many of the women I've dated would have been good partners but I pushed them all away. And now I'm approaching middle age and I seriously am thinking of giving up on finding a lifelong partner. 

When I'm in a relationship, all I can think of is being out of it, to be free, to meet lots of women and have fun. But now that I'm out of this amazing relationship, the thought of having flings and meaningless relationships for the rest of my life fills me with dread and despair. I want a family one day. I love children. But I don't think I'll ever be able to get to a mental state where I'm capable of that.

46,The Essential DA Problem,"Believing you cant change this, believing this cant be fixed.

I see most Avoidants, online & irl, doing this. Instead of trying to become securely attached, they try to work with being avoidantly attached. Instead of seeing it as a problem programmed into them they need to program out, they think thats just who they are.
It's like being on fire and trying to learn to live with it instead of trying to blow the fire out. Would you rather learn how to try to reduce the pain you cause yourself and who you have contact with by you burning, or would you rather put the fire out, *ending* the pain inflicted by this to everyone involved? 

Now managing the symptoms instead of fixing the root cause is a very common human issue. Believing you cannot fix it is the definition of a self fullfilling prophecy.
If you believe you cant fix it, it is guaranteed you wont fix it.
Subconsciously this is what you want, because you believe the work to fix it is too much for you.
Meanwhile truly believing you *can* fix it, and behaving accordingly by making it a priority in your life you commit to, it's guaranteed one day you would have this fixed.

Now there's an excuse for people who do not know about Attachment Theory. 
There's people who just lack the information on whats going on with themselves, and if they had it they would commit to change it.
But there's people who would prefer not to do the work to change anyways, even if they had the info. 
For those people, this excuse is invalid.

Now this is not just about DAs, this is the same for every insecure Attatchment. So, why do I say this specifically DAs biggest problem? 

Because their attachment style is the most self-reinforcing, for many reasons I'll explain now.

APs don't like being APs. Don't get me wrong, many DAs don't like being DAs either, and many APs would rather stay the same then change too. But, usually, being DA works out better for people than being AP does.

Because DAs style works by supressing vulnerbility and becoming counterdependent. Meaning, worst case they push everyone away, they could survive that. If an AP makes everyone run away, they could not survive, because their style works by being codependent, they are not supressing their vulnerbility. 

Its easier for a DA to believe how they do things is a superior stragedy to life. To believe everyone else is the problem. That's harder to do for an AP. If they would make everyone else the problem, they would most likely bring upon the thing their style does not want, which is distance. If an Avoidant's attitude creates distance, well okay. Like I said, it's pretty self-reinforcing. 


Lots of DAs see it more like a character trait, like that's just who they are. 

""yo, just dont get too clingy with me, I need my space, cant deal with that""

Versus

""yo, I am an anxious mess, please validate me, I need you""

What sounds better?

It's way easier to own the Avoidant traits then the Anxious traits because they are seen as more strong, attractive, etc. in our society. Of course underneath the DA is as much an anxious mess as the AP, but our society isn't too focused on what's underneath. It's shallow, and on the surface Avoidance comes across much better than Anxiety. It's ironic, but the DA's disinterest in depth fits with the society's very same disinterest. 

Shutting out your deeper needs and feels also fits in with work culture. 
On average APs earn the least, DAs and Secures earn the most, though Secures are more happy with their jobs. 

So it can kinda synergise with getting your job done, so again helps you earn money and therefore survive, reinforcing self reliance. 
Where it doesn't synergise is in interpersonal relationships, that's the weakness. 
Because relationships are about connecting, and people who aren't avoidant get satisfaction from depth in those relations.

Its also their weakness because of course underneath they long for connection. But they suck at it. This is where the wheat seperates from the chaff. There will be the ones who this will motivate them to change and truly question their take on life, or the ones who just accept they suck at it, and probably start putting the blame for it on others, instead of seeing how they themselves are at fault for not putting in the work to change their subconscious beliefs and create healthy boundaries instead of unhealthy walls. They are clingy. They are giving me not enough space. Etc etc. 
Not, ""I am too sensitive about closeness and need to change, be more comfortable with vulnerbility and intimacy"". - SAID NO DA EVER, lol. 

In my opinion thats where the hate for DAs comes from, which they receive the most. Because so many get hurt by them in those relationships, plus they are most likely not to change and acknowledge how them not changing is responsible for many problems coming up. Instead, they normalise the problem. 

Normalising the problem is another very common human issue, to bring the text full circle.
This is about trauma, meaning not having received what you needed in the past. Facing this is the work people want to evade. In this society resolving trauma is not advocated for, trauma is normalised instead, we get taught to live with it, just like many insecurely attatched people do with their attachment issues. 
But nobody can do this for you, your life is your responsiblity alone. 



Bottom line is, all insecure attachments are equally in need of change, but DAs, in this world, happen to be the ones most likely not to change.

48,How to not rush to intimacy on first dates,"I asked my psychologist advice on dating as a DA and a very slow trust builder. She asked about what I do on dates, and then said *""You make the conversation about them 95% of the time and you validate their needs if you see them? No wonder they all fall in love with you so quickly, if you're making it so easy for them to project onto you! You're coming across like a warm, accepting figure who will take care of them and make them feel SEEN.""*

Which is true, I do all of that. I hate talking about myself, and I find people very interesting. I also trained myself never to be boring, so I end up being a personal entertainer. All of which primes people for an intimacy I can't reciprocate.

So my homework is to be less irresistible on dates. Small talk more, don't pick up awkward silences, talk about stuff *I'm* interested in (AssCreed II, framing in movies, what the best plants are), don't open people up like clams so you can get to all of their interesting insides, don't disclose more than you feel comfortable with. And if they're insecure about something, to just let that fucking shit lie because they're a stranger at this point.

I'm doing it now for pre-date chats and I feel like the most boring person in the world :-)

49,{DA} Just a reminder: You're all really fucking brave.,"I'm a DA and after three years of very deep/intense attachment work in therapy, I feel I'm entering a new stage. (I'm hesitant to even say it, but I'm feeling pretttty earned secure these days :O) 

The shifts that have happened internally lately, are causing me to reflect. And the main thing I'm reflecting on is the fact that any Avoidant person who comes to healing work, and who peels back these layers and defenses inside themselves, *is really brave.* 

I'm often humbled and amazed at how deep these patterns run in our minds. We were dealt this hand of cards that we didn't ask for, and we didn't deserve, and it would be so much easier to just let it be. I'd wager a big bet that 99% of people who inherit an Avoidant attachment pattern as a child, never change that pattern significantly, and they live their entire lives that way. There is very little out there on the internet writted by Avoidant people who are working on themselves (particularly DAs) and that's becuase frankly, most people aren't willing or able to do the work. 

Everybody here who is working on themselves, growing, and pushing their edge of vulnerability, I just want to remind that you're doing extremely difficult, brave work. I'm proud of all of us.",v6ktqb,105,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/v6ktqb/da_just_a_reminder_youre_all_really_fucking_brave/,AvoidantAttachment,0
50,Cognitive Dissonance,"Does anyone else get the worst cognitive dissonance when it comes to relationships? Or almost like a pendulum type of thinking that swings back and forth. For example:

“I love this person. I feel so happy and comfortable spending time with them.”

“But I wish I could be free to hook up with other people.”

“But that wouldn’t be worth losing this person. I’ll stay and work it out.”

“But if I stay, I’ll lose my independence and  resent him for it.”

“But I’ve voiced this feeling with him and he still loves me and is willing to work through things with me.”

“But what if I’m really just half assing this relationship and I should leave and stop wasting his time.”

“But I can’t imagine my life without him.”

“But if I get out now before it gets TOO serious, maybe I can spare both of us from some of the pain.”

“But shouldn’t I at least give it a chance?”

“What’s the point of giving it a chance if I’m going to keep escape routes open for myself the whole time? He deserves someone who’s all in.”

“But does it have to be that serious? So many people just get into and out of relationships all the time without a second thought.”

“But that’s not how it ever goes for me, getting into another relationship will take up another 3 years of my life, time I could be using to do my own thing and not worry about anyone else while I’m still in my 20’s.”

“But am I just forcing myself to be alone to prove to myself that I can be?”

“But maybe I really do need that time to be single because I’ve never really had it?”

“But what if I’m missing out on amazing memories with this person? What’s wrong with just letting myself be loved?”

“Well I wouldn’t be able to enjoy it anyway. I should spare him from my bullshit because I’d just ruin it with my anxiety.”

51,Update: This sub remains restricted. It is still about AVOIDANT attachment {DA} {FA},"I’m giving an update, this is especially for people who are trying to gain access to this sub, but also in effort to communicate about some of the whys and hows. 

- This sub is about AVOIDANT attachment. This sub is for posts by people with avoidant attachment. Not for others to post about their partner with avoidant attachment, not their anxious side, not random topics that have nothing to do with AT other than you sprinkling in an attachment style.

- For the purpose of this group, we allow people with avoidant attachment as well as disorganized FA who trend highly toward avoidance to post and talk about their own avoidant aspects here. The anxious related side of disorganized/FA is not what this sub is for. There are several FA subs, all of which I do not know the status of, but I hear they open and shut on a dime and I’m sure that stinks for the people who want to have a designated space. Regardless, this sub is about avoidant attachment. We are not responsible for other subs. 

- You have to be an approved user to post/comment. This is because our avoidant users and this sub itself was a longtime target of trolls, people who do not understand AT taking out their frustrations on strangers, harassment in comments and DMs, people getting banned for breaking rules and making fake accounts to re-join and continue their shenanigans. 

- We had to draw a line about which accounts we approve. We are not approving new accounts. For any reason. Your story about why your account is new is not special, I’m sorry that is harsh, but the answer is no. 

- We are not advertising exactly how old an account has to be for approval. Why? History tells us that many (not all!) who are hell bent on getting access can be manipulative to gain it so we aren’t disclosing the specifics. We are being consistent behind the scenes applying the criteria for approval. 

- We are getting some pushback, primarily from FAs and APs who want to gain access with new/newer accounts, and frankly, those who are lashing out like that - when we say, “We are not approving new accounts” do not belong on an AVOIDANT attachment sub anyway. Read up about it - people who trend toward avoidant attachment do not tolerate that kind of behavior well, I’m sure secure people don’t appreciate it either. Call it a wall or whatever term is the buzzword of the week, but in order for this sub to stay civil and on topic, we’re sticking to the guidelines. No, it is not about the mods getting “triggered,” speaking for myself, when the lashing out occurs, I feel the same way I did when I replied to the first query. We’re just not letting strangers bulldoze us. It was no the first time and will continue to be no. Threats and the like will get muted. If you harass us, we will report you to Reddit. 

- If you are coming here to figure out your partner or ex, you’re in luck because your question has probably been discussed ad nauseum and is in a FAQ (keyword search FAQ), in one or many of the weekly relationship threads, or in a post. It takes some elbow grease but I assure you, your question is probably not new or unique.",12s6m5f,107,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/12s6m5f/update_this_sub_remains_restricted_it_is_still/,AvoidantAttachment,0
52,What I wish more people would realize,"Attachment style is irrelevant in relationships. 

What is relevant:

\-Self awareness from both parties  
\-Values that align  
\-Healthy and effective communication  
\-Healthy boundaries  
\-Mutual love and respect

Obviously this list isn't exhaustive. In my opinion, attachment theory is meant to be a tool to help *yourself.* It's meant to be a tool to help you recognize and correct unhealthy patterns and coping mechanisms that you may have. It's meant to be used for self healing and development. 

A lot of people take it way too far, especially when it comes to avoidants. The focus becomes ""how can I fix my partner's avoidance"" and not ""how can I be more healthy in this relationship."" Or god forbid, ""Is this even a healthy relationship to begin with?""

I started my current relationship as an FA leaning very anxious. Looking at my post history when I first discovered attachment theory, I definitely was one of the ""How can I change my partner"" people. My boyfriend, who I'm pretty sure is FA leaning heavily DA, is the most caring person I've been with. Due to his avoidance, he could not fully commit to our relationship. Had I listened to popular dating advice as well as the general advice given to people dating avoidants, I would have ended things. But instead I chose to trust myself and look at the bigger picture. 

\-He was aware of his avoidance and knew that he was independent, pulled away when things got serious, and afraid of being trapped. I was aware that I was anxious, too reliant on others, and leaned in when things got serious to the point of smothering.  
\-He values hard work, stability, and being a really great parent (values that aligned with my own)  
\-We could both tell each other things we didn't tell others without judgement, just support. We slowly transformed this into healthy and effective communication. We started working through issues in real time and actually resolving things vs letting resentment build. He started communicating about needing space or time to process things. I started communicating about my needs in a healthy way instead of using protest behavior.  
\-We have a lot of unsaid boundaries that we respect for each other, and we're still working on other boundaries. But we are working on them together.   
\-No matter what happens or how rough things feel between us, there is always mutual love and respect. We can have a really tough discussion that makes us both feel like we may not make it, and before we end the conversation we're expressing that no matter what we love each other and will be there for each other. 

Moral of the story - attachment style is irrelevant. You can be with someone avoidant and make it work. You can be with someone anxious and make it work. The reason it isn't working for a lot of people is because they're trying so hard to be with ANYONE that they keep trying to make it work with the wrong people. I'd even argue that they just aren't self aware enough YET to know what they truly even want. 

And just as an afterthought - any kind of relationship dynamic is valid as long as it works for all parties involved. So for people to say that avoidants who want to only see someone once a week or not live together is wrong, no. It's valid - it may not conform to societal norms,  but it's valid. And odds are there's someone out there who wants that too. Why are we constantly trying to change people instead of accepting them for who they are? And when you do that, figure out if who they are is someone you're willing to work with.

56,Can {FA} and FA leaning DA really say they know the {DA} experience?,"***Discussion Question:*** ***Can Fearful Avoidants and FA leaning DA really say they know the DA experience? How?*** I'm requesting that you please review what I've posted (I know its A LOT) and/or also provide references that might be different from mine if you have any. 

***Background:*** I wrote this, partly because I wanted to tease out the differences and understand them better, but also provide direct references for others so hopefully it's clear what I'm talking about and where I am coming from, and that I didn't make it up :)

As a DA, I've found myself a lot less able to relate to a lot of what I see on this sub, and I was kind of getting confused. I then realized it is because **FAs and DAs are not the same, even though we continue to be lumped together as one.** I often see this occurring when people of other styles ask us questions, and they say, ""My ex is DA or FA..."" and that kind of sends up a flag for me because there are major differences between the two. We have different experiences, pasts, core wounds, and difficulties. One being disorganized attachment (FA) being different than the organized attachment style DA (APs are also organized styles). 

I also found myself getting irritated (you'll see where this word comes into play later) when I noticed  that when people ask DAs specifically for a question, there are lots of FAs and APs who rush to answer and speak for DAs. This has happened on every single attachment group I've been in on and off of Reddit through the years so I'm not talking about anyone specifically in this group. I get how in this sub specifically, we mesh together talking about avoidance, but between the DA and FA styles, there are so many differences, even our deactivations,  that I became uncomfortable when people were answering as DA when they do not experience the internal processes or life and attachments the same as DAs. In trying to figure out what my problem was, I started going through videos and articles. 

My personal conclusion is at the end. 

&#x200B;

***FAs and deactivating: How it works***

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QotDsOtY\_oQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QotDsOtY_oQ)

She said deactivation strategies are very different for FA vs DA. ""Very dramatically different experiences."" 

FA's overarching theme - strong emotional charge. (DAs deactivate more often but less intense.)

A lot of ""associating"" - push person very far away to get away from one's intense pain. Push someone so far away, sharp and harsh would words, threatening to leave, say they want it to end, but internal experience is ""I will do anything to get rid of this pain.""

When they get out of deactivation, they feel guilt, regret, remorse. All of it is coming from a trauma response. 

Overcompensation related to self protection. 

Feeling they are meeting other people's needs too much, hyperattuned, feel taken advantage of. Unseen, unheard, misunderstood. This creates a lot of stories for the FA. ""If you loved me more you would \_\_\_\_."" 

What is usually taking place is being triggered, they don't feel safe, don't know how to a pinpoint trigger. All they know is they feel bad and its related to the other person. Thinking a lot about all the meaning they assign to it, helplessness, all the ways they are hurt. 

They go straight from deactivation to activation, does not come back to center. 

&#x200B;

***DAs and deactivating: How it works***

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmpS61XPDEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmpS61XPDEM)

Experience: Compared to FA, DAs do not experience the same intensity of deactivating, but more frequency. 

Can come from a wound that comes from feeling a little uncomfortable, feeling ashamed, or not wanting to be vulnerable. Need to create space. 

Compared to FA, DAs generally feel the emotional intensity/experience  at 4/10 but frequency 6-7/10.

FA emotional is  intensity 9/10, harsher, sharper, mean, very sudden and extreme. Frequency 1-2/10.

DAs can show a little warmth, a little pushing back. Never hot and cold, more like lukewarm and cool, sometimes cold when triggered. Don't really get too hot. This is because they have wounds related to vulnerabilty and feeling unsafe, I am unsafe = never getting ""hot"" with someone due to being guarded. Other reasons are sensing independence or autonomy is threatened. Feel defective, shame. Often carry a pattern of a lot of connection, but due to defective wound, the act of being seen kick wound into gear. 

They might open up followed up by a shutdown/withdrawal. It can be like a turtle going back into its shell, feels seen and needs to hide. 

Might identify with feelings of irritation because they are repressing into subconscious, they can be in touch with surface level emotions, but takes healing to realize all underlying emotions and wounds.

***FA Activating and Deactivating Strategies***

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVKwWT68hUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVKwWT68hUs)

She said of all 3 insecure styles, talking about this is most important for FA  since both sides of the style can be confusing and keep them in ambivalence.

\- FAs share physical distance deactivating strategies w/DA where when they are angry, don't want to be touched, but for FA, this is smaller than the activating side wanting closeness/physical closeness. Polarities create high highs and low lows. Can activate through physical connection like sex to get back on good terms and reconnect.

\- Have vulnerability hangovers but can have the polarity of being an over-sharer as well. From being very private to super sharing. Might have blips of oversharing with a stranger. Might hide themselves by talking about the other person they are with, focus on the other, becoming a barrier/cloak around themselves (avoiding and also activating). 

\- Triggered deactivating - extreme - deactivate way more intensely than DA. Very strong fight or flight response. Really painful thoughts about relationships or people in their life. These wounds are more about the past than the actual person there right now. Then come out of that with extreme guilt, remorse, regret, and go overboard to fix, leaving them vulnerable and feeling rejected again. 

\- Comparison deactivating - FA like to compare; when needs unmet, they might deactivate by starting to think about what it would be like to be with someone else (subconscious protective mechanism)

\- Distrust deactivation: As soon as trust is threatened (even if someone didn't do anything wrong) might think how they don't need the relationship, ""I cant do this,""  ""I can't deal with this pain anymore.""

\- Infatuation deactivation: Creating an invisible wall/buffer. Can be separate - doesn't have to be due to unmet needs in relationship, can be a trait or quality within that someone expresses, wants to attach to those traits. Needing to integrate a sense of wholeness. It is a way of creating an invisible buffer. 

&#x200B;

***DA Deactivating Strategies***

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq0C5wTL9dM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq0C5wTL9dM)

Most common for DAs specifically: 

\- Fear based - closeness/openness/vulnerability/commitment/fear of being weak/something is wrong with me (can be on and off until it becomes strong) - Feelings minus fears, so deactivation happens when associating something they are experiencing as not good (even if is going well) but in competition with the competing subconscious associations brought to the surface. Common version: big date, lots of connection and emotional intimacy, DA may take space due to fear based subconscious association(s) triggered. Need to pull away. 

\- Sadness based - Often takes place when they are going through a certain set of challenges (sad, under stress and pressure from own lives). When emotional bandwidth has shrunk, not feeling well, depressive episode, etc, shrinks even more, becoming more emotional unavailable. Can be more long term deactivation. More of an ongoing deactivated state. Feel shame, do not want to be seen when in shame. 

\- Self protection - when feeling hurt in a relationship dynamic (by criticism, feeling vulnerable, misunderstanding). Maybe takes 3-4 days, can be sped up if the coast feels clear. 

\- Anger/resentment/spite : usually a build up of resentment, unmet needs, doesn't feel they can get their needs met from others, because they don't believe there is a point, start to feel an imbalance. Can even come out of passive aggressiveness (spite) but competing association needing connection (depending on the situation). Can be short term, but might turn into long term, push away, break up

\- Self avoidance/feeling avoidance: When someone is not wanting to feel their feelings or is disconnecting from themselves due to pressure, family challenges, etc. Shut down and numb out, become a little bit more cold than usual. Keeping walls up because feeling emotionally overloaded. 

&#x200B;

***Difference between FA and DA deactivation***

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yg-LE8P\_bU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yg-LE8P_bU)

\- DAs minimize need to attach.

\- FAs have a lot of extreme inconsistencies due to inconsistency in childhood, extremes are polarizing and traumatic (example - they learned when parent is in chaotic side, child strongly deactivates due to fear, creating emotional stories, and this is what they re-enact when triggered. Mirror the way they adapt to reality. 

\- DA tend to be more pervasively deactivated. 

\- FA can be very activated like APs, very connected, but when deactivated, intense pulling away, lots of intense emotions stored from childhood. Deactivate less frequently but more intensely. Never feel they can settle into a relationship. 

&#x200B;

***The Hardest Part About Being FA***

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqUaGHxhiig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqUaGHxhiig)

\- Relationships in general that have emotional intimacy required can be overwhelmingly difficult. Want love, loyalty, intimacy, wanting to be seen for who they are, but then has a lot of limiting programs, fear of trust, fear of betrayal, fear of being trapped, fear of saying no, fear of abandonment, unworthy, bad. Step forward, step back. Reach out, pull back

\- Inner turmoil - swing from anxious to avoidant, highs and lows, juxtaposition of two worlds, very confusing for them and others. 

\- Storytelling - how much they personalize things due to past hurts. Always a personalization narrative running in the background. Aware of pattern changes due to issues with abandonment. They suffered previously, now as an adult, have an added layer of suffering by re-projecting. 

\- Inherent guilt and shame. Can be boundryless, feel they over-give, under-receive, then become frustrated, volatile. Might say something rude or sharp to protect themselves and push/away, then feel guilt later. 

\- Carry a big trust wound.

&#x200B;

***The Hardest Thing About Being DA***

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F21HH5pBZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F21HH5pBZw)

(She starts out talking about the ignorant comments on her videos and in the Facebook groups!)

\- Really feeling. Trying but not knowing how to do better. Lack of modeling for emotional attunement, knowing what to say, knowing the right thing to do. Not knowing what to do causes pressure and needing to flee. Issues dealing with emotionally charged issues

\- Amount of shame they carry. A lot of it is shaming in relationship to self. History of past shame that becomes a narrative that they are shameful. If someone sees us, they see our defectiveness. Overvalue privacy, avoid vulnerability. 

\- Feeling that opening up is weak, and this can be defeating. Assume connecting with others = losing self. Often feel misunderstood and unheard. Due to lack of modeling, not able to express internal reality. Can go into apathy mode, don't need people, can do life by themselves.

***DA's 8 Major Core Wounds and Emotional Patterns***

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMacsgtKS70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMacsgtKS70)

DAs can identify with wounds, but they are more unconscious than subconscious, may not feel or experience them but they are still coping from it. 

1) I will be abandoned (unconscious) due to emotional neglect -Manifests by building positive associations with being alone due to deep unconscious/subconscious abandonment fear. DAs may not feel the fear, but behaviors show it. 

2) I am (physically) unsafe. Manifestation: physical unrest, subtle fight or flight from a young age,   attachment to things and animals. Might hoard, not want to share, protective of their things. 

3) I am alone (subconscious) but don't hurt from it as much, feels safer being alone. Feeling panic, fear, agitation, irritation. 

4) I am defective. Manifestation: hiding, withdrawing, escaping. Feelings: sadness and shame. Often internal shame they carry at a pervasive level, want to keep others at bay. 

5) I am trapped/stuck/powerless. Feelings: anxiety, frustration, fear, irritation. (Irritation is large part of DA imprinting). 

6) I am misunderstood. Manifestation; indirect communication to mitigate vulnerability. Feelings: sadness, fear, disconnection, need to escape, protect. 

7) I am unseen and unheard 

8) I am stupid. Manifestation: growing intellectual faculties. Feeling; judgmental and critical of self.

***FA 12 Core Wounds and Accompanying Emotions***

Source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCzEHVMCtPU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCzEHVMCtPU)

She said FA is generally the style with the most core wounds. 

1. I will be betrayed. This is the biggest one. Adapted by becoming hypervigilant. Can't trust others. 

2. I will be abandoned. Sometimes this goes with I will be betrayed. Stinging hurt covered by anger, resentment, frustration. Can be like an emotional cocktail, which can vary due to individual experiences. 

3. I am bad.  Had to adapt by being perfect to not set off caregivers. Perfectionism = safety. Hard on self for making tiny mistakes. Shamed or guilted self so hard due to original association with making mistakes. 

4. I am defective. 

5. I am not good enough. Put a lot of pressure on self, often parentified as a child. 

6. I am unworthy. 

7. I am trapped, helpless, powerless = I am out of control. Emotions: frustrations and anger. 

8. I will be attacked. (Subconscious) Will hyper-defend self when feeling attacked. Anger, emotional outbursts/volatility. Big reactions to small things.

\- DAs might pursue at the beginning, like initiate plans and conversation, might show interest, but are not clingy, doesn't want to see all the time or text all day but might touch base through the day.

\- DAs are intellectually available, can also be present socially, but talking about deep feelings and fears is different, will see a different and a difference in time spent in those.

\- FAs want to know why you feel how you feel, how you felt, what you did after, very interested in the other and deeper dynamics of the human experience. 

\- DAs want to know more what you think than how you feel. 

\- DA burns out faster than FA, DA slower to warm up, FA quite warm and present.

***Disorganized Attachment (FA)***

Source: [https://www.psychalive.org/disorganized-attachment/](https://www.psychalive.org/disorganized-attachment/)

*""A person who grew up with a disorganized attachment often won’t learn healthy ways to self-soothe. They may have trouble socially or struggle in using others to co-regulate their emotions. It may be difficult for them to open up to others or to seek out help. They often have difficulty trusting people, as they were unable to trust those they relied on for safety growing up. They may struggle in their relationships or friendships or when parenting their own children.  Their social lives may further be affected, as people with secure attachments tend to get on better throughout their development. Children with secure attachment are often treated better be peers and even teachers in school. On the other hand those with disorganized attachment, because they struggle with poor social or emotional regulation skills, may find it difficult to form and sustain solid relationships. They often have difficulty managing stress and may even demonstrate hostile or aggressive behaviors. Because of their negative early life experiences, they may see the world as an unsafe place.""*

""*People who formed an avoidant attachment to their parent or parents while growing up have what is referred to as a dismissive attachment in adulthood. Because they learned as infants to disconnect from their bodily needs and minimize the importance of emotions, they often steer clear of emotional closeness in romantic relationships. Dismissively attached adults will often seek out relationships and enjoy spending time with their partner, but they may become uncomfortable when relationships get too close. They may perceive their partners as “wanting too much” or being clinging when their partner’s express a desire to be more emotionally close.*

*When faced with threats of separation or loss, many dismissive men and women are able to focus their attention on other issues and goals. Others tend to withdraw and attempt to cope with the threat on their own.  They deny their vulnerability and use repression to manage emotions that are aroused in situations that activate their attachment needs. When they* *do* *seek support from a partner during a crisis, they are likely to use indirect strategies such as hinting, complaining, and sulking.""*

***My Personal Conclusion***

I do not see much of an overlap between FA and DA. It appears to be much more than simply a mixture between AP and DA. A couple core wounds are shared, but the reaction to the triggers are different. The deactivations are for different reasons, at different intensities, and different frequencies. They are separately categorized from each other. Even if a FA identifies more ""avoidant"" traits at the moment, those avoidant traits/reasons/manifestations are different than DA. And while FA folks can absolutely speak for their own avoidance, I do not really think it is fair to speak on the behalf of a DA. 

In short, I do not see how FA leaning DA is the same thing as DA.",115jrv0,94,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/115jrv0/can_fa_and_fa_leaning_da_really_say_they_know_the/,AvoidantAttachment,0
57,Avoidance is like Hoarding,"I just want to start by saying that I'm in no way implying that avoidant attachment is a psychological disorder. I thought of this analogy the other day and it fits so well with my own experience, so I just wanted to share it. 

Avoidance is like hoarding. You could say that our brains are like a house. In my brain, I suppress things. It starts off small enough when I'm a child, and I can still still move around freely and without really noticing this thing. Slowly I add more things to the collection. This room holds my traumatic memories. This room holds my feelings/emotions. This room holds my fears. As I grow up, the rooms start to become less maneuverable. I'm vaguely aware that something doesn't seem right in my brain, but I can still access everything I need so I ignore it. I continue to suppress until one day I have only a small path that is safe to use. I stick to that path day after day 

I let someone in (my therapist) who points out how cluttered my brain is. How little room there is to move. How much I have to face and deal with. But I can't. It's easier to suppress and pretend it doesn't exist. Until one day a pile of things falls on me and I finally see how bad it is. I finally see how the things I've been avoiding have prevented me from truly living. And I want to expand that safe path. I want my whole house to be safe. 

Cleaning up is so overwhelming though. Where do I start? Do I start with recent traumas, or childhood ones? Do I start with my feelings and emotions, or my fears? Who can I trust to help me with this massive project? So you just pick a place that comes up. You pick a room, and you pick the first thing that you see and you work on that. But when you clear it out, it reveals the long buried and deeply suppressed things that hurt so much to face. 

So instead I jump around to another room and clean a few easy things. Then when the deeply buried things come up again, I move to another room. And suddenly healing - which should be a positive thing - becomes even more overwhelming. Because now I can see the deeply buried things - I'm aware that they are there. They lurk in the shadows of my house every day, waiting for me to deal with them. My instinct is to just suppress new things and bury the deep things again.  But I know that isn't healthy, and I can't. 

This is where I'm at in my healing journey. Slowly cleaning out the things at the front of the mess, and starting to become aware of the things buried deep down. It's scary and daunting and relieving all at the same time, and I want to press forward. I want to clean the bad things out to make room for good things. I want to truly live instead of being suffocated by this mess that I've held onto for so long. I want to free myself, even if that means a few mental breakdowns, arguments, and pain along the way. 

I did not intend for this post to be so personal, and sharing it feels very vulnerable. But I think it was important to put these thoughts down.",rxhdv3,95,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rxhdv3/avoidance_is_like_hoarding/,AvoidantAttachment,0
58,Avoidant Relationship Advice,"We get a lot of posts asking for advice related to understanding an avoidant within a romantic relationship. Please read this post before posting about your situation as it may have the answers you're seeking. If your post contains a question answered here, ***your post will be removed***.

&#x200B;

**Q:** Do you know what my Avoidant is thinking?

**A:** Absolutely not.

&#x200B;

**Q:** My Avoidant broke up with me. Will they come back?

**A:** Impossible to know. However, the reason why your Avoidant has left is important.

* The more dramatic the ending, the less likely they're coming back.
* The less established a relationship is, whether or not your Avoidant actually has avoidant attachment style becomes more questionable. Maybe they just decided a connection wasn't there. Probably not coming back.
* They left out of the blue. The relationship dynamic was Avoidant-friendly. The most likely situation they're coming back.

&#x200B;

**Q:** My Avoidant deactivated. How long is this going to last and what should I do to encourage them to come back?

**A:** The reason for deactivation and your dynamic matters.

* Deactivations can last months and even years especially in a cohabiting arrangement.
* The more anxiously you express your behaviors, the more likely the deactivation lasts longer.

What you can do:

* Believe the things they say during this time. If they express uncertainty in the relationship, they mean it. It doesn't matter how much potential you think the relationship has-they don't share your perspective at this moment.
* It is imperative that you not think of solutions for them at this time and instead assess your own behavior, their behavior, and evaluate the relationship from your perspective. Because when/if they come out of the deactivations, you need to be prepared to address what happened and come up with a solution. Yes, this might push your Avoidant away even further and out of the relationship and that's the point. You want to filter out romantic mismatches.

&#x200B;

**Q:** We broke up but I/they want to be friends still. Should I?

**A:** I almost guarantee you that you need time apart before doing something like that. Take time apart to heal. Ask yourself if you truly just want a friendship or is there a part of you that wants a relationship? If its the latter, only pursue that with them. Mingling under the guise of the former is manipulative and someone's gonna get hurt.

&#x200B;

**Q:** They asked for no contact. How long will this last and when should I reach out?

**A:** Probably never. Until its been like, 6 months. You could probably shoot your shot then.

&#x200B;

**Q:** How do I show my Avoidant that I've worked on myself and I've gained the tools to make our relationship work?

A: You demonstrate it when they are interacting with you. If they do not wish to interact with you at the moment, then you cannot show them.

&#x200B;

**Q:** My Avoidant and I are perfect together when we're not in a disagreement. If only we'd do xyz, we wouldn't be having this push/pull dynamic. How can I make them see that?

**A:** There are two universes involved in these interactions. Most things in their universe are arranged differently than yours and the dialogue going on in there does not echo the same sentiment in the question.

&#x200B;

**Q:** How can I get my Avoidant to give me more reassurance?

**A:** I think working on your attachment style will provide a more accurate answer than anyone could. Please visit your attachment style's subreddit for resources. If you are an Avoidant, then welcome! You've arrived at your subreddit.

59,My therapist said….,"“I’ll still be here.”

Earlier this year, I switched therapists to a more somatic, feeling focused one.  I’m trying to feel feelings that I’ve long shut away, figure out trust, just generally make some headway in shifting my DA ness to something more secure. When questions of trust come up — trusting others, trusting the therapist — I have an instinctual, visceral reaction: Anger. Raise my voice. Yell. It’s my fear, showing up but it pops out as anger.

When that happens, when those outbursts come, I’m ashamed of myself. (It’s underlying theme of all the sessions.) We process that too.  In doing so today, I told my therapist how ashamed I was of getting angry. I hate it when I do it. I hate yelling. I hate yelling at him. All he’s ever said were positive, truly helpful observations, and it rips me up that I raise my voice. That I can’t stuff the anger and fear back down.

In response, he floored me. “You can be angry. You can yell at me. I’ll still be here. I’m not going anywhere.”

 I couldn’t talk for what felt like 10 or 15 minutes. I’ve never heard anyone say that before. To me. To me. 

I’ve cried off and on since then. The avoidant parts of myself scream not to trust what he said. Not to trust him. And I don’t know if I do trust him. What’s weird, what’s arrived with the tears, is I don’t know if I -don’t- trust him either. It’s this really strange in-between thing. My own personal Upsidedown.

When I started therapy, I was certain my 50 plus year DA style was unchangeable. There was no way to get to “secure.” This is how I’m going to be forever. I’m not sure of that anymore. In keeping with the earlier journey to my Upsidedown, I’m also not -not- sure. I’m still trying Tom feel this. Stranger Things indeed.",15v7eer,90,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15v7eer/my_therapist_said/,AvoidantAttachment,0
60,Does anyone struggle to feel truly connected with people? {da},"I've had this issue for my whole life; a type of disillusionment or dissociation, like imposter syndrome with the whole world. I feel like I'm searching for an unattainable state with people where I can ""reach"" them, we are fully present together in the moment, and can share ourselves honestly, with no walls. I've never attained this state with anyone (friends, family, partners). 

Either I feel like they aren't being present or ""real"" with me, or I've got a million things going on in my head that I'm withholding and so I don't feel present or real myself. Most of the time I can put the worry aside and go about my life, but when I get stressed, it's front of mind. It can be really distressing and cause me to spiral as well as distance myself or end relationships. 

I think I just broke up with one of my closest friends because of this. I've talked to her about it before, but things finally fell apart when we were coming home from a vacation together and I worked up the courage to tell her (on the plane, ffs) I didn't think I could do trips with her anymore. The times she thought we were sharing a close moment, I still felt like she was distant and not reachable. She thought our back-and-forth texting was enjoyable and I always thought she was brusque and didn't have time for me. Etc etc. It's been like this for more than two years. 

And she was really hurt by that, probably feeling like the last two years of our friendship was a lie. She asked, ""if you've felt like this the whole time, why were you still going through the motions of being my friend?"" I didn't know how to explain to her that *all* my friendships feel like that. When I ask myself the question she asked me, I can't think of a good answer, so I start to avoid friends. 

TL;DR-- I feel like I can't reach people, which leads to me dissociating from relationships entirely, and falling into extreme avoidance. It's a difficult feeling to convey, but has anyone else felt similarly? Is there any way to ""snap out of"" it?",12ba7yz,89,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/12ba7yz/does_anyone_struggle_to_feel_truly_connected_with/,AvoidantAttachment,0

64,{AP} or just too into me???,"How many times a day do we see posts titled *DA or just not into me??* in the AT subs?

I've begun to consider the opposite: Is it possible Avoidants are turned off by people whose interest in us is so antithetical to our feelings about ourselves?

I've written before about how I think I can sniff out APs on a first date. I said they don't truly see me, but only see an immediate solution to the ""girlfriend vacancy"" they're desperate to fill. Their enthusiasm feels inauthentic. How could they know me well enough to think I'm so great?

When people like me too much, too soon, I think they're fools. I know I'm terrible, and I feel guilty for misleading them with my superficial charm.

But I'm beginning to wonder if maybe a few of these people were just showing a normal degree of enthusiasm. Is it possible people we Avoidants perceive as dangerously AP are actually secure and simply very excited about getting to know us? 

Perhaps they aren't prematurely over-estimating us, we're just chronically under-valuing ourselves.

NB: This is not an invitation for APs to tell us all we need to do is \~\*accept their love omg\*\~. This is a discussion prompt for Avoidants about whether our hypersensitive radars may misidentify normal signs of interest as AP red flags.",10ej3jr,84,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/10ej3jr/ap_or_just_too_into_me/,AvoidantAttachment,0

69,Sometimes my partner will annoy me {FA},"Sometimes my partner will annoy me.

Sometimes they will fall incredibly short of what I want for myself. 

Sometimes they will actually infuriate me.

Sometimes these instances will sour me toward them and I'll feel off with them for a moment, an hour, a day, two days. 

And by ""sometimes"" I mean ""regularly.""

But even more often they're amazing. And most of the time things are going just fine or better. And when I zoom out and remember to notice the good, I am nearly bowled over with gratitude. 

So those ""sometimes"" don't have to ""mean"" anything. They just mean that we're both human and relating closely. They just mean we have differences, and thank goodness really, how else would we grow. So when those ""sometimes"" arise I remember to express things that are necessary to express, but otherwise hold onto the big picture, and make sure to remain loving because we are lovable through loving.

70,The truth about loving yourself first {FA},"""You have to love yourself before you can love somebody else."" 

That's the general quote, and I've always hated it. Mainly because I don't relate. I've never had any trouble loving anybody else. In fact, it's come easy to me. Loving is easy, it's the relationship that is hard. 

I spent 13 years in relationships that were abusive in one way or another. Always believing that 'love conquers all', another general quote that is total bullshit. Love doesn't conquer narcissism. Love doesn't conquer abuse. Love doesn't do anything except keep you in the cycle for longer than you should (although maybe that's just the codependency). 

When marriage 2/2 failed, I started to realize that I was the common denominator. That there was something within me that brought me to these types of men. Something within me that kept me with these types of men for longer than I should have. Something within me that is so deeply seeded that I have been aware of it my entire life, but that I didn't realize was causing me so many external problems - I hated myself. 

I didn't feel worthy of love. I didn't feel seen, heard, or understood. I didn't believe I deserved to exist. And all of these core wounds led to self loathing. I can make you an entire list of reasons why I'm a good person, why I deserve to be loved, why I'm not a piece of shit. But I will also automatically counter every single one of those points with something negative. 

And it was literally within the last week, because of the most recent heart break, that I realized the truth about loving yourself first. It's not a matter of having to love yourself to love someone else. It's a matter of loving yourself before you can accept love from someone else. 

There were things I did wrong in my most recent relationship. I probably wasn't as all in as I wanted to convince myself. I didn't communicate in a healthy way. I let bad behaviors slide to avoid conflict. But the way I loved him was not wrong. I loved him hard, and unconditionally. I still love him, and I will probably always love him, which is honestly a first for me. I guess that's part of how I know it's real. Anyway, the problem wasn't that we didn't love each other. Because undoubtedly he loved me too, probably as much as he was capable of loving anyone. The problem was that we loved each other, but hated ourselves. 

Every time he said or did something to show me he loved me, I automatically countered it with something negative. If he invited me over and said it was because he enjoyed having me there, my brain turned it into 'he's just using you for sex.' If he told me he loved me, my brain turned it into 'for now, but that will change.' It literally didn't matter what he said or did - I knew it wasn't true. Because how can he possibly love me when I ***know*** how awful I am. And that turned into another reason to keep him at arm's length. In my head, the real me is an awful undeserving of love piece of dirt. And if he knows the real me, then he'll hate me too. 

I don't know, because I still haven't talked to him, but I think he probably had something similar going on in his head. My therapist would yell at me for making assumptions, but isn't that the crux of avoidance? At least for a lot of us. We can't let anyone see us, because they'll see how 'wrong' we are and they'll leave. Ah, I'm getting off track. 

Moral of the story is that I didn't need to love myself to love him. It was my self-hatred that messed things up. It's always been my self hatred that's messed things up. My self-hatred had me believing I don't deserve to be treated like a human, so I put up with abuse. My self-hatred had me believing that I don't deserve to be loved, so I accepted love that was less than what I wanted. My self hatred stood in my way at every turn, perpetuating bad relationships and probably sabotaging relationships with the potential to be really good. 

At the end of the day, no one can love you louder than you hate yourself. So it's time for me to stop hating myself, because it hasn't done me any good so far.",ssapvb,82,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ssapvb/the_truth_about_loving_yourself_first_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
71,"{DA} They call us ""avoidant"" but breakups are still emotional wrecking balls","It's been a few months since this relationship ended, but I found this subreddit, and it seems like you’d all understand why it still gets under my skin.

My ex described herself as having anxious attachment. And she described me as avoidant. At the time, I didn’t know those terms, but she’s right on both counts. But she was also just generally anxious. Clinically diagnosed. And I think “general anxiety” might be an extra layer on top of “anxious attachment”...but maybe I’m wrong.  

So you have me, DA, and her…anxious. That anxiety would manifest itself in her getting upset about a picture of me and ex buried in a stack of old books ( something I hadnt touched since unpacking). She’d scan my social media to see who I'm following. Even worse, she sneaked into my phone after secretly watching me type my code in. She’d call me at like 11am on workdays just to ask “Do you love me?” She’d text, and if I didn’t reply in 10 minutes, another text, and if I didn’t reply, a call, then 5 more calls. And each time this would eventually lead to me distancing, and then when the distancing didn’t work, I’d get angry. “Why are you calling me in the middle of a work day about non-emergencies?” There was no previous fight. No reason to expect this. And this continued no matter how many times I’d ask. Even when I learned to communicate how it makes me feel, “I feel anxious and chaotic when you call me crying while I’m at work. And I wish you would either text, or save this for later in the day if it’s not urgent.” She couldn’t stop. It was compulsive. She'd blame me like, ""So I called you during a meeting, so what?""

And I didn’t know “dismissive avoidance” but I knew I was introverted, and aloof, and quiet. And i could imagine how that impacted someone who wanted more emotions from me. And of course I’m the bad guy, right? All this girlfriend wants is love. And I’m some kind of damaged freak who can’t provide it. So each time we’d blow up, I’d blame my “introversion” and  say “I gotta be better.” So I’d learn that I shouldn’t leave the bed in the morning without holding her. And since I work from home, I’d prep and cook dinner based on when she’d come to visit after her work ended. I’d surprise her with her favorite lemon cake from the local bakery (god, i hate citrus desserts). I’m never going to be one for flowery, poetic language and grand PDA, but I’d make sure to hold her hand or playfully “accidentally” slap her butt if we were walking down a quiet sidewalk…like “whoops, I was just swinging my arms as I walk.”  The point is, as avoidant and dismissive as I am…I tried to improve. But it always felt like there’d be some new thing I WASN’T doing. A new item on the list of “how to show love”. Which I think is a part of anxious attachment…they can’t escape that feeling of being unloved, unworthy.  But I wanted a steady set of rules/goals that I could learn and achieve.

As the relationship approached the end, there was another big fight. I cant recall the reason, but I knew she was gonna call nonstop, so I just put my phone on airplane mode for the night. While at work the next day, I get a text from her brother, who I never met, calling me “abusive”.  Which I’ve never heard in my relationships. I’m very flawed in my attachment style, obviously…but I don’t curse anyone out, I don’t call names, I definitely don’t throw objects or hit people. It turns out her definition of “abuse” is ignoring her. But when saying that to her family, it just comes off as “He’s abusive and mean.” So I have her family thinking I’m some kind of raging lunatic because I don’t want to be on-call for her 24/7 as she finds new reasons to be upset.

None of this is to say that I’m perfect. I have all DA qualities. I’m secretive. I need space. I don’t communicate well. I’m great at the beginning of relationships, but I grow distanced as more is asked of me. Every ex has asked me to be more complimentary or communicative…but none of them have thought I was mean or “abusive.” 

Overall, the logical part of me knows that this relationship had to end. There were many good moments, and many ways that the healthy part of our personalities meshed. But I couldn’t build a 50/50 life with a partner where it always felt like 50% of the partnership could blow up at any moment unless I matched some undefined, constantly-shifting concept of love. You can’t plan a mortgage in that situation. Can’t plan for a happy home for a future child. But the emotional part of me knows that we loved each other, and it sucks to be so close to someone, and so close to planning a life together, and learn that your genetics or upbringing or uncontrolled elements of your past just won’t let it work out. 

So here I am. Back in therapy. Trying to dig my way to the source of whatever makes me a DA. Trying to remind myself that I’m not “bad” or “weird”.

73,I don’t know if I can fix it {fa},"I have fucked up every romantic relationship of value to me. Close friendships also are hard. I feel like I’m diseased, and all I do is spread pain to those close to me. 

People just can’t see it. They’re drawn in by my passing demeanor, and I am legitimately a good caring person in that environment. 

I am the worst though. It’s like a switch flicks and suddenly I am flaky and I can’t be reached and I hate being around everyone. I hate being seen and heard. I just want to crawl into a hole filled with ice water and freeze to death.

74,I just communicated a boundary and I feel more connected {FA},"I (27F) have been casually dating a guy for a month or two. Today he messaged me about wanting to try a new type of thing sexually. I didn’t want to. 

I felt the urge to either just go along with it or to just end things completely. I felt like I was going to let him down, that we’re incompatible and that he doesn’t understand me. I felt like crying and just very uncomfortable. 

But instead of following my gut I responded instead asking for more info about his perspective and also expressing that I didn’t think I was interested in it. He replied in a curious way, asking questions about how I felt and about my previous experiences of it. 

And actually I was surprised because he was very validating, understood my perspective, was not pressuring at all, and still communicated his side of things. And I was able to be vulnerable sharing how it often feels like there is generally pressure to do certain things to meet other people’s expectations and how I appreciated him being understanding etc. 

And now I feel way more connected to him than before and like it’s helped build trust. I’m glad I for once actually communicated my true feelings and gave him the opportunity to talk it through with me, instead of just cutting him off or going along with it and then feeling upset later on. 

So yeah, only something little but still a big step for me I think so wanted to share.",xpv4nc,78,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/xpv4nc/i_just_communicated_a_boundary_and_i_feel_more/,AvoidantAttachment,0
75,"I do it to myself, I do, and thats why it really hurts.","I recently came to a crushing realization that; I am only attracted (very attracted) to people who are more avoidant than me. 

Because I am afraid of intimacy too.

I get to feel all the feels, from the safety of no reciprocation.

The crumbs are delicious when you are starving, with no threat of being smothered.

My first LTR was with an incredibly caring affectionate secure man. I left him for someone totally emotionally unavailable and dismissing. 

With DA I never felt loved in the ten years together, which while painful, felt safe, like I could breath.

How I sum up what it feels like to be FA : *I felt most comfortable when he was home, but in the other room leaving me alone.*

It was such a painful relationship. We would try to spend time together by going on hikes or riding our bikes, but he would always walk/ride far ahead of me, or far behind.

Like we where just both doing solo activities at the same time.

If I asked him to walk beside me, he would let me catch up for a few minutes, then he would be off again. Our pace would never match or sync up.

And it was always my fault for being ""too slow.""

I was a workaholic, and (by design) had an opposite working schedule to him. 

He suggested that I move one of my days so that we had the same day off. But the thought of having a whole day just the two of us filled me with... terror(?)  I did it anyway. I took off Sundays.

On Sundays I felt like I couldn't speak up for what I wanted to do, or how we should spend our time.

 I often feel like there is no point is stating my wants or needs, because no one cares or follows through anyway, I feel less let down when I say nothing at all. Which overtime just leaves me feeling resentful and defeated.

So I left it to him.

Our ""quality time"" on Sundays involved a hike with mutual friends, the entire time spent interacting with others.

Then we would go home, he would sit on the patio listening to music with a beer. I would sit inside, working on projects.  Every time he came into my sphere, even if it was just to say hello, I would stuff down my annoyance.

He eventually left me, sighting that we felt more like roommates than lovers. The same reason why he left his ex wife. He still doesn't see his contribution to the pattern. I am now aware of mine.

I have tried dating since then, Turned off by men who are actually emotionally available, the chance that it might actually go somewhere makes me cringe, I lose respect for them.

I recently dated a man who was seemingly very available and made a lot of effort  in the beginning.

 I didn't care much or take him very seriously, but he kept perusing hard, so I let him.

I eventually came round, and we met in the middle. 

This past nine months felt like the most satisfying relationship I had ever had. The perfect combination of ""no pressure"" yet still high mutual interest. I fell head over heels.

With first LTR we where more like best friends, there was no chemistry, I didn't know it could be different.

With DA it was all chemistry and attachment anxiety, followed by deactivation and then my staying out of dependancy.

With this last relationship (I suspect for many reasons I wont get into that he is FA as well)

That it's the first time I have actually fallen in love. 

It's because it happened very slowly, in the absence of attachment anxiety.

But the middle could only hold for so long.

The more I reciprocated, he eventually started backing away.

It activated my anxiety.

Which activated his avoidance.

I acted out.

The rupture.

His refusal to repair.

I had a very hard time letting go this one, I feel like things could have easily worked out, find a compromise that works for both of us. We essentially want the same thing, but he no longer trusts my anxiety, he feels duped, like I tricked him into thinking I was someone different, someone ""chill"" 

I am chill, dependancy paradox. The less you pull away, the less I'm gonna bother you.

But you cannot get through to someone who is unwilling to listen or communicate. No matter how calmly or perfectly I try to word things, he immediately shuts down.  

I'm heartbroken, but I have done all I can do. 

You can try and get someone to understand, but you can't get someone to *want* to understand.

 So I've moved on.

I've decided now that the answer is to be single and actually live with roommates. 

Warm body in the house, with the firmer boundaries that you will actually leave me alone.

All the comfort, none the annoyance.

I can still do the casual random hookups, cut em loose before a chance to attach.

At this point; I don't see any other way.

Being in love feels wonderful, but it simply isn't worth the pain anymore.",s74xgw,77,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s74xgw/i_do_it_to_myself_i_do_and_thats_why_it_really/,AvoidantAttachment,0
76,"Is attachment theory as portrayed in today's world truly helpful, or does it just perpetuate damaging generalizations? {FA}","Another user recently asked for Thais Gibson's credentials, which include a PhD from an online ""university"" that can be obtained in a matter of months. As one of the main sources of modern attachment theory resources, one that I myself have referred others too, the knowledge that her degree is not exactly credible makes me question a few things. 

Across the attachment spaces on Reddit, Facebook, PDS, etc there are quite a few generalizations about the attachment styles. It seems that people take these generalizations and apply them to anyone in their life that shows the least bit of a sign that they may fit into x attachment style. However, even from my participation in the attachment subs here on Reddit, it's easy to see that one DA is not exactly the same as another. One AP is not exactly the same as another, and so on. Yet just the mention of the label creates an automatic bias. When someone I personally know shows signs of being AP, it immediately makes me withdraw and distance. 

Only after initially learning of Attachment Theory as portrayed today did I focus my knowledge on my partner and how I can use it to ""fix"" him. I quickly realized that the only person I needed to ""fix"" was myself. After that I've always taken the attachment styles as a helpful tool in bettering myself. Here is this set of behaviors that I might be more likely to have than someone else. It's a building block in the bigger picture of healing, and a starting point to become more self aware about behaviors that prevent me from connecting with others. It's not the only piece of the puzzle I need to heal though. 

But even Thais Gibson's content seems to be -even if subtly- directing its users at ways they can fix their partner. Or manipulate their own behavior to change their partner, rather than on actual healing. A lot of the healing I've done for myself hasn't necessarily been attachment related. It's been communication skills, learning how to have and hold healthy boundaries, learning how to respect someone having/holding healthy boundaries, learning to self soothe, building my self worth, radical acceptance, EMDR, etc. All things that can be done without even mentioning attachment theory. And honestly, my boyfriend's attachment style has nothing to do with any of that. My mom's attachment style has nothing to do with any of it. I don't feel like it's knowledge that we need to have in order to heal and have better interpersonal connections. 

So I wonder, is all of this really helping anyone to connect better with others? Or is it only perpetuating damaging generalizations and causing further disconnect?",12ua1t3,80,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/12ua1t3/is_attachment_theory_as_portrayed_in_todays_world/,AvoidantAttachment,0
77,Avoidants are more common than you think {DA},"I was talking to friend the other day who seems to be very much like me. He has had a string of short relationships, which he always gets bored of and bails on at some point. The difference with him is that he always finds a justification for leaving. He never sees himself as the problem. It’s always the other person falling short.

I think a pretty large percentage of the population is avoidant — they just don’t acknowledge it.

I think what makes people here different is that we recognize we’re in an unhealthy pattern and try to break out of it, and we are distressed by our avoidant behaviors and try to change rather than make excuses every time a relationship doesn’t feel right or gets too stale.

78,My avoidant nightmare {DA},"We met in spring. 

You asked me out about a month later. You seemed nice, so I said yes. 

We went on a few dates. Good dates, too. Never did you make me I feel like I owed you anything, or that you were pressuring me. 

A couple weeks later you said you had feelings for me. I was shocked, because, though you were a gentleman, I felt like we still were getting to know each other. We didn't even know each others' favorite colors yet. I felt you didn't know me well enough to genuinely have affection for me. 

I told you as gently as I could that I did not return the sentiment. You did not take it well, which was understandable. You were very lonely and very stressed in other areas of your life, and that didn't help. You fell apart telling me how frustrated you were wishing you could have a relationship like everyone else has. You told me you wished you had ""a girl"" and I suddenly felt like I wasn't special or unique to you in any way, that anyone could be in my place and you would've felt the same. In the end you told me that you were sorry, but you couldn't just be my friend. I understood, and let you be. 

You stopped talking to me for about 2 weeks. We passed each other like strangers. To say it was awkward would be an understatement. I was a bit annoyed with your behavior, but otherwise unaffected by your absence. 

Then one day you messaged me out of the blue and started talking to me again. I didn't know why. I was confused. But you were treating me with kindness, so I reciprocated that kindness. We started hanging out. Every week. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We went to museums, malls, parks, all the kinds of things I'd never done before with someone else. We were always together. Months flew by with you by my side. 

We even started watching movies at your house, since my home life is... chaotic. And I remember the last time we did, I'd had a long, stressful day at work. I was beat down and exhausted. But spending that time resting with you made me feel like I was going to be ok. And there was that one time when you looked at me just a little too long, as you often do, and at once I wanted to kiss you. There was next to no space between us on your couch but it might as well have been a thousand miles with the restraint I exercised. I cried driving home because I didn't know what to do with myself or how to feel. 

We continued spending time with each other like that, and I wrestled with my emotions and beat them back with a stick. That is, until you told me something in your life was going to change so we wouldn't be together as much. I responded nonchalantly, like I always do, trying to pretend like I didn't care or that it was no big deal. 

I lasted 3 hours. 

Something in me broke. Some levee of emotion or dam of avoidant attachment was destroyed within me and I sobbed because I was going to lose you. I messaged you, my vision blurred by tears, asking for an explanation of what I did wrong. In a brief, uncharacteristically transparent moment, I also told you I was crying. You told me we would talk in person the next day. I couldn't get you to call me about it, since I just wanted you to tell me you didn't care anymore and get it over with. I didn't want to look at you. 

I cried myself to sleep, when I woke up, as I was driving to work, and when I drove home. My eyes were puffy and they stung. 

Finally we met. You had kept saying ""we'll talk"" as if I'd been preparing to say or do anything but listen to the sounds of your footsteps walking out of my life. 

I told you to go ahead and tell me what was wrong or what happened. You looked at me and told me that I did nothing wrong and what in the world would make me think you were going to abandon me? I told you why, and you explained those away until I was silent. You said ""Can you come here?"" and held out your arms for me to hug you, which I did. I don't think I have ever held a former stranger tighter to me in my life. I think we stayed like that for 2 entire minutes until my breathing steadied. I wanted to crawl into your lap so I could finish crying, and also so you could hold me. 

We talked some more, laughed a little, and I calmed down. You told me you were deeply sad imagining me crying over you, yet happy because you thought I didn't care. I felt awful. I still do. I'm not as nice as I'd like to be. You kept asking me if there was anything I wanted to say, anything that was clear to me now, anything I wanted to verbalize. I cannot verbalize an emotion to save my life. But I can write, so writing is what I did.",z0kj79,76,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/z0kj79/my_avoidant_nightmare_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
79,For those who wonder if healing is really possible | {SA} {DA},"Hello, all! I’ve been keeping more to the comments for a good long while because I’ve been keeping busy with life (and found it quite fulfilling). Yesterday I decided to take the attachment style quiz and see how my style has changed since the last time. Look at those results! The second slide is from roughly one year ago. 

You’ll notice that one particular relationship is very skewed away from the others, and it’s not so much my attachment style as a whole that affects that as it is the specific persons behavior. If it were a relationship I could opt out of, then they wouldn’t be on the list at all, but you can’t just undo someone being your parent, unfortunately. Still, I think it makes it really clear where the genesis of my attachment problems comes from. 

But, if you’re wondering whether or not it’s possible to really and genuinely earn functional security, the answer is yes. I have occasional tugs toward making some rough suggestions/guidelines on how I did it as possible resources, but I’m a) a little lazy and b) afraid of looking like a know it all, haha.

87,{fa} I am choosing to rewrite my internal monologue around deactivating.,"This stops with me. Today. 

I have been in a relationship for just over two months. For two months, I have managed to avoid deactivating. I have stayed present, I have avoided running, I have been vulnerable, I have stated my needs and asked about his.

It has been the farthest thing from easy. But I’ve done it. 

Last night the fear took over and I deactivated. Hard. Canceled plans, took to my bed. And all of the shame and fear came rolling into my head. 

“You hurt everyone that cares about you. You’d be better off alone. This relationship is isn’t right. You are trapped. Your are cornered. He is better off without you. You are too broken for a relationship.”

I suffered in that for about 18 hours. I feel hungover now, the next day. 

But I am choosing to be different. I am choosing to rewrite the internal monologue. I am CHOOSING to say “Damn, I went OVER TWO MONTHS without deactivating” (my record before that was THREE DATES).  I am choosing to say “I CAN stay.” I am choosing connection. I will not give in to this fear. 

It’s not an excuse, and I have an apology to make. But I know that I have to break out of this shame spiral if I’m going to reconnect. So I am making the choice to love and forgive myself, and to offer the same to my partner. 

I believe I can heal. Time to act like it.",tzv9yf,71,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tzv9yf/fa_i_am_choosing_to_rewrite_my_internal_monologue/,AvoidantAttachment,0
88,Taking care of yourself? {DA} {FA},"Hey! Some fun self-sharing topic for everyone and also a suggestion.

Yesterday my friend spontaneously decided to go on a trip to another country for a while, and asked if she can leave the flowers she bought yesterday with me. Apparently she likes them so she just decided to get some for herself and put it in her room.

It's weird, and I'm not normally a flower person, but I realized that having them contributed to my overall mood. They just look pretty and every time I see them I get a little mental smile, it's not like a whole mood change but it's just some random nice thing throughout the day.

It made me realize that people do small things like this for themselves pretty often, and I never think of it. In fact I go out of my way to not get these things because they're not ""necessary"" and I feel like I'm spending money in a dumb way. I do the same with hobbies: instead of doing that, you need to focus on work etc. I realized I deprive myself of joy often just to do the ""rational"" thing. And to me that feels normal, but having these flowers in my room made me aware of how different I live and how many just daily happy triggers I miss out on in my days. This is a direct result of my lack of emotional awareness and dismissal of my needs and feelings, so I felt it was relevant here.

How about you? Do you have a similar story/pattern? What can you do for yourself this week, or regularly every week (not expensive etc)? Let's incorporate nice things in our lives!

Edit: I believe this is also good relationship practice by the way, because similarly I also never think of doing these small things for partners either.

Two of them expressed concern about me going home for Xmas and promised to call me daily if I will have a hard time with my family. 

Last weekend was filled with so many good and amazing people. And to top it off, my mom, where all my issues started, texted me words of encouragement. She wanted to let me know that no matter what happens with a big job promotion I have been trying to get, that things will be okay. I was so happy and then so so sad. 

For the first time I feel both happy and extremely angry/sad. I can’t help but wonder why it took her so long to treat me like she cared. I also look back at the poor friendships I had in the past and wonder if my life would have turned out different if I had friends who treated me better. I know for sure that it would have been different if my mom treated me better. 

Suddenly I am feeling feelings from my last three break ups as well. Like I’m not so sad about the most recent one. I start thinking about “what if” scenarios with that one but then mostly my thoughts go to the guy before him. And I suddenly realize how much I felt for him and the weight of how sad I am that it didn’t work out with him and that he is a terrible person just came to the surface. We broke up 3 years ago. And I feel like me choosing to heal is finally unearthing all these emotions. I was numb for so many years. I didn’t care about much. I was apathetic. I didn’t care about friendships or maintaining them. I don’t even remember my life before starting with EMDR 3 years ago. And I know I’m better off now. But I can’t help but hate it. Life was easier when I could just switch off. Now it seems like everyday a new floodgate opens. It’s harder to just drown myself in excessive work and escape through that. I feel like things were easier when I wasn’t aware.",zfbodz,70,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/zfbodz/do_you_ever_wish_you_never_started_healing_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
95,I got dumped by {DA} but I handled it {SA},"As the title states, my DA sat me down to end things with me. It was on Friday the 13th. 

Two months before this break-up, he told me that he didn't believe I loved him. I took this as a sign that he loves me dearly, but he is unsure of my feelings (despite that he just needs to look at the evidence right under his nose). I took that as encouragement to use more affirmations. I called him ""darling"" and said ""I love you"" regularly. I focused on doing my own thing, being pleasant and myself, and we did not fight or argue. I felt really good these two months. I even picked up on small cues and hints that he was considering taking a leap of faith and committing to me. Which would entail that we get engaged and married - I know how he thinks and how seriously he would take this. 

On Friday he said that he needed to discuss our procrastination on some household chores. I agreed. It seemed sensible. He sat me down and the conversation escalated unexpectedly. 

He was grasping at straws to have a reason to dump me.  He for example said because I did not clean the windows that he suddenly got fed up with me. He also said that the past two months were a nightmare for him, because I kept saying ""darling"" and ""I love you"". He felt that this was hell. He told me that he wants nothing to do with me and my cat anymore. He said that I need to find a new apartment and that I should have always known he is a player, as his friends egged him on to be, and that he arranged himself a date the following day and he is being polite to even share that with me beforehand. To be honest, I felt he was severely disassociated and confused. Because I was so calm during this talk, he told me ""you don't react like somebody who loves me"" and I replied with ""that is because I love and respect myself"". The next day he actually went on the date, and I teased him a bit with it before he left. It is so unfair of him, considering he didn't take me out on a date for two years, but whatever. I went out for drinks with my own friends and I had fun. 

I handled this SO SECURELY, I am so proud of myself. I just told him ""OK"" to the news. He made a decision, it is his life. All I can do is accept it. I did point out that he has a destructive pattern and I am tired of being on the receiving end of it, and that the love of my life wouldn't treat me this way. But other than some emotion that even an SA person would have towards this, I did not feel dysregulated at all. 

Afterwards, I reflected on the situation and I decided to send him a detailed note where I responded and explained my side of things. The TL:DR of that is; I told him I want nothing but the best for him and I love him, but it is his life. I accept the ending. 

I think this threw him off-guard so much that he recalled how much he actually loves me too. He rarely posts on social media, but he posted a song that perfectly fits the situation and is very deep. After I watched it on his story, I could tell how affected he was. I have been focusing on myself, but all the cues I get from his side is that he regrets his actions and he wants to approach me, but he just hasn't found the courage yet beyond expressing his feelings in a song. The song touched me, but it isn't enough. 

I don't know what the coming weeks have in store for me, but I know that this break-up offers me a chance to clearly think about what I want for my future. I can use this to definitively end it, and if he actually does want to be with me, I expect a clear statement of commitment and an action plan to deal with his DA-behavior. 

Whether he realizes it or not, my DA stood guard over my healing process these past 4 years. For this I am so thankful to him. I grew from unaware FA to SA, because I could heal myself relationally next to him. I realized at some point that he was my stable rock when I was volatile and he wasn't leaving. Now I am SA and he senses this he says ""you don't even need me"". I can tell this frightens him, because he is used to the co-dependency of relationships. I think he (and anyone with dysregulation btw - I find this an interesting debate) misunderstand that it is *BETTER* to *NOT NEED* someone. Saying you need someone, is like saying they are like oxygen to you, and you would feel asphyxiated without them. That generates fear, because that is what creates the clinging/distancing behavior. *I create my own oxygen. I am the air I breathe.* I regulate internally even if the external is sometimes like an air vaccuum. The fact that I can still WANT someone, despite that I don't need them, is why I am SA and a healthy prospect to someone else. He is confused and simply has a distorted concept of what love is in my point of view. I understand that and I don't blame him for it. Haven't I been there before? 

Well, I don't know what the future has in store for me, but this ""tower moment"" actually excites me. I certainly am not crying in bed about how he dumped me. There is creation in destruction. The cycle has been dysrupted and that holds the promise of change. I can't see so far ahead that I can predict what change, and whether there is a place for us to be a part of each other's life in that change, but I am open to change and I welcome change. The FA part of me feels like a fish in the ocean of chaos. These moments are stepping stones that I use to ascend. 

TL;DR: I got dumped by my DA, but I handled it SA.",uvx1o2,71,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/uvx1o2/i_got_dumped_by_da_but_i_handled_it_sa/,AvoidantAttachment,0

97,{FA} How to (securely) let go of someone who can't meet you where you are?,"Like so many of you, I fell for another avoidant a while back. Another FA, I've historically been with (up to marrying) DAs so I think I found the familiarity and periodic depth and openness especially intoxicating. 

It was brief, but it did make an impact. I think on both of us. 

I tried to meet them where they were. They were not capable of receiving me. It's been over for a while and it's clear to me now that they are, likewise, unable to meet me where I'm at, though both of us had expressed interest in friendship. I've been iced out for reasons that will remain a mystery to me unless I ever hear otherwise, so I'm learning what I can from my own actions and trying not to tell myself any stories about theirs.

I am probably just more healed than they are. I don't even feel angry with them, I'm just sad. There was a lot of potential good there, even as friends, and it makes me sad we weren't able to make more of it. I also have some regrets about not being more communicative in some ways. I realize now I was just a bit scared to get vulnerable, because I'm still healing myself. Granted, their connection was not stable, so my fear was not unfounded.

If they ever contact me again, I will listen with openness and see how I feel. But there's no guarantee that will happen, so it is time to let go.

Does anyone have any experiences to share, tips, whatever, on Secure ways of letting someone go? I am regrettably soft-hearted and can't force myself to be mad at someone I'm not or I would lol.

Edit: I'll respond more individually later but after kind of a long, busy, unpleasant day, the heartfelt insight and support on this thread was incredibly nice to come home to.

But then once in a while, I find people who want to spend time with me. I don't want to reject them, but then I get overwhelmed by the idea that they might expect more and more from me as we grow closer. I'm too scared to even share those things I've done anonymously on Reddit, but I basically cut people off as soon as they get close to me.

99,Just another avoidant coping mechanism - anyone else? {FA},"So my boyfriend and I had a disagreement and I definitely felt some attachment wounds being triggered. He asked for some space to process his feelings, which I respected. I honestly needed my own space as well. 

But I noticed that I had this intense urge to do something to prove I don't need anyone. That night I took my shower faucet handle off to adjust the temperature because it wasn't getting hot enough for my taste. It was super frustrating and I literally thought when I was done ""See? I don't need anyone. I can do everything on my own."" 

Which got me thinking... I do this a lot. When I get upset in my romantic relationship mostly, I will do some task I've been putting off or hoping someone else will do and then validate myself that I don't need anyone. While obviously there's nothing wrong with me doing things for myself, I do think it's an issue to use this as a coping mechanism for being upset. Almost like ""Oh, you think you can abandon me? Well fuck you. I don't need you anyway.""

100,{da} How do you stop being so attuned to the expectations of others?,"I'm hyper conscious about what others may want and expect from me. The feeling is a constant low level anxiety, as if I had a radar in my head that is always on and scanning the environment. I'm trying to read other people's minds and then act in a way that is in line woth their (assumed) needs and expectations.

Practically, how this goes down - let's say we're both chilling out after work in the living room. I'd be thinking (subconsciously very often, but sometimes I catch myself) about what my gf wants to do and what should I do to not make her angry or discontent with me. Frankly this makes me feel quite pathetic, like a scared baby without character. 
Often were not doing anything specific, she's just on her phone and me too, but I'm too anxious to grab a book and go read in the bedroom, because she could not like that (...). 

And then after a while I'd start growing resentful, because I'm not spending the time in a way I'd like to. Honestly, very often I cannot even tell what I'd like to do - my mind is so focused on the expectations. This then leads to a deactivation, ofter another argument and the cycle continues.

Did any of you struggle with this? Any advice? I know it's probably as simple as growing some courage and doing stuff I want to do, but it's internally terryfing and often I don't even know what I want.",ybbwfy,69,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ybbwfy/da_how_do_you_stop_being_so_attuned_to_the/,AvoidantAttachment,0
101,"FA - what changes have you made/things have you done in the short term to avoid ""randomly"" deactivating on a partner?","i'm in what is looking to be the first actually healthy long-term relationship with someone who i enjoy the company of and find attractive AND who doesn't trigger my attachment issues hardcore but i'm worried the ""boredom"" that comes with that lack of being triggered and the stability/lack of drama is going to make me shut down on him. that i'm too ""broken"" to really enjoy a peaceful and happy relationship and all i deserve or can function in is chaos, drama, or with emotionally unavailable people who i feel like i have to prove myself to. i also have a bit of a case of ""phantom ex"" with a guy who dumped me after 3 months of spending time together + texting 24/7 + other stuff that set up an enmeshed dynamic, then breadcrumbed me for 3 more months after dumping me and then cut me out of his life entirely in march (and i know he isn't good for me, but it's something i'm still healing from and i definitely WANT to be over it.) it probably doesn't help that we're technically long-distance and can't see each other a whole lot.

he's staying for 3 nights this weekend and right now when we haven't seen each other for about a month (though we've video-called) i'm feeling more ""avoidant"" about it than excited/happy and that's kinda scaring me. he's a fantastic guy. he's supportive, compassionate, funny, responsible, i don't have to guess at what he's thinking or feeling at all, and we have a lot of the same interests/hobbies, can laugh together, and we're not obsessed with each other.

i know that truly resolving this is going to obviously involve long-term work and trauma healing, but i was wondering if anyone else who's had a history of ""deactivating"" on partners has any advice for this type of situation and has had anything that's helped them deal with it in the meantime. thanks.",166jtmn,69,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/166jtmn/fa_what_changes_have_you_madethings_have_you_done/,AvoidantAttachment,0

**Avoidant Attachers:**

How do you tell if it is your avoidance/deactivation or disinterest?

&#x200B;

\----

This can be the megathread for this topic which comes up frequently here, both asked by users and non-avoidant attachers in the weekly thread. 

***Reminder:***  
*- I’m looking for Avoidant attachers to answer for themselves, not for their exes or partners. For example, “I’m DA and I've done that, and this is why.” Not “My FA/DA ex did XYZ…”*

*- This is a JUDGMENT FREE ZONE, where Avoidants can answer these questions open and honestly. There will be zero tolerance for attacks, shaming, lecturing, or therapizing the people answering the questions. There are no right or wrong answers when you're speaking from personal experience.*",12ktnbw,67,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/12ktnbw/ask_avoidants_faq_is_it_my_avoidance_or/,AvoidantAttachment,0
103,Men who pathologize women who've rejected them are misogynists. {FA} {DA} {AP},"Of course female users do it, too, and sometimes people's exes really did have mental illnesses/personality disorders/extreme attachment insecurity.

But there's a gross trend of male users posting chronically about the same girl who dated them - often fewer than 5 times! - and throwing every diagnosis in the DSM-V at her until they can rationalize away why she lost interest.

Their egos simply cannot tolerate the notion that a woman who'd initially been nice to them could reasonably decide she no longer wants to date them. It *has to be* due to something broken inside her. It *has to be* caused by some faulty wiring in her brain.

It never fails that they admit they've discovered Attachment Theory within the last 72 hours, but they're oNE ThoUsAnd PerCeNT pOsITivE their ex (who often sounds like she was creeped out and tried to let them down nicely) was a stone-cold, calculating DA.

They weren't dumped, they were blindsided! It hadn't been early-days enthusiasm, it was love-bombing!

If the DA label doesn't fit, they suddenly realize she was actually FA. And if that doesn't get them sufficient ego-wanks, it's on to claiming she had BPD. BPD not quite explaining it? Next logical step is to call her a narc. And if she wasn't an obvious narc \[read: she wasn't at all\]? Well, then they're confident she was one of those insidious ""covert"" types!!!

They claim to be doing a public service by ""warning others"" to spot the signs of these irredeemable sirens, but their obvious fixation indicates they'd do absolutely fucking anything to have the particular girl back.

107,The book ‘attached’ solidified my ex’s view of me,"I’ve started to read that book and have realized it’s really critical of the avoidant attachment style. My ex actually wanted me to read it at one point but I dismissed it as I thought I was above that kind of stuff. Unfortunately it wasn’t until after the breakup that I started to look into attachment theory. I regret not doing it sooner because if anyone needed to read the book it was me. 

After she read the book things started to change though. She became very critical of me and even began to accept that I was never going to change or even want to change for the better. I think she knew that she needed a more secure person as a partner if she was going to be in a relationship meant to last. She wasn’t wrong to think I’d never want to be secure as I showed no signs of changing. 

Now I want nothing more than to move towards a move secure attachment style. It took me hurting someone I didn’t know I loved as much as I did until after she broke up with me. I finally realized how I made her feel and don’t ever want to do that to another person again. And now because of how I behaved, I pushed her into the arms of someone else.

108,Correlation between avoidant attachment style and not wanting kids? {FA} {DA},"Recently I have been wondering if there might be a correlation between having an avoidant attachment style and not wanting to have kids?

I know that the reasons to have or not have children can vary from person to person, but I wonder if securely attached people are more likely to want children because they see the world in a more positive light? Aren’t afraid of messing their kids up, because they don’t carry as much trauma?

112,"When I date someone, my brain is highlighting their flaws and I would want to work on stopping this {da}","I am so happy that I have found this sub. I recently understod that I am dismissive avoidant and that is the cause of most relationship issues I have had in my life. When I have written about my issues in other relationship subs, I always get the advice to ""break up"". Like there would be a magical unicorn partner out there somewhere that would not trigger my insecurities. 

So writing here with people who maybe have felt the same feels so much better. 

What I will cover in this post I have tried to talk with friends about over the course of my life but nobody has ever related to it. So if it happens now, it will be a first. 

I am currently dating, the best girl I have ever dated, if there is a relationship that can go the distance this is it. Reason why I am prephahsing with this is just to highlight that I know she is not the ""issue"". I know that I am. I have felt this way with every single girl I have dated. 

I always idolize girls that have left me, that no longer wants to be with me, because they are no longer a ""threat."" But the once that want to be with me are. 

So for example, the girl I am with is very beautiful. She is the most attractive girl I have dated. But of course, there are more attractive women in this world. And if I see someone that I think is more physically attractive than my girl, a wave of pain goes through me, and my brain thinks ""oh now you can't get a girl like that (attractive stranger)."" 

When I have mentioned this to friends over the course of my life, nobody could relate. Correct me if I am wrong but I think it comes from being dismissive avoidant, that my brain tries to keep distance from the girl I am dating by seeing all other options, so if I end up alone again, it will not be so bad because then all these other girls are possibilities again.

Is there a way to stop this? I of course would never act on it. So it will not end my relationship, I just don't like it that i walk around and do this even if I understand where it comes from.",13rbo9i,64,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/13rbo9i/when_i_date_someone_my_brain_is_highlighting/,AvoidantAttachment,0

116,Why is it that /I/ have to work on me and not the other way around? {da} {fa},"Long story short, I have a friend who’s extremely anxiously attached and has BPD on top of it. I have autism and I’m avoidant. We clash a lot, and I’m usually the bad guy.

She needs me to promise her that I will never leave, but I can’t, because to me that’s an absurd thing to ask someone. I don’t know if that’s my avoidant attachment style speaking, or if that’s true, but it makes my skin crawl.

I talked about wanting to go to therapy for my low self esteem, and she said “Eh yeah! And for your attachment issues!” where I then questioned what she meant, and she said “Well for starters, you can’t even promise your best friend you won’t ever leave her.” Which just rubbed me the wrong way.

She says stuff like “I know you want to live alone in a little house somewhere but I want to move next to you!” or “I can just see us growing old together” and I want to scream.

If I bring up how uncomfortable this makes me, I’m being avoidant and need to work on myself. I want to cry and scream and hit myself.

117,"I {FA} love my anxiously attached partner, but it's so hard to keep doing this.","I love him so much. So much. He's the only one I want.

But the constant suspicions, trust issues, mean comments when his feelings are hurt, passive aggressiveness, inability to tell me what he wants/needs in the relationship, insecurities, anxieties are getting too much. Too much. The fights are too much.

All he wants is to feel security from me. All I want is to be with him. But I can't be with him when he reacts so anxiously to everything (he was upset I missed my cat after we traveled for 3 weeks TOGETHER), and then that makes him feel insecure, and then the cycle continues.

Why don't people talk more about how DAMAGING anxious partners are? How toxic they can get? How it can turn into verbal/emotional abuse when their partner is really trying to give them what they need, but the AP just wants *moremoremoremoreneverenoughalwaysMORE*?

Help. We were supposed to start couples therapy today, but we got into a fight last night and left each other. So we canceled the appointment. I love him, I want him, I need him. But I can't do this. It's getting so hard to bounce back from the things he says when he's hurt.

121,She loved me so much and would be there for me for anything. It took her finding someone else after I broke us up for me to realize how much I love her,"It's too late to do anything. She was more of an anxious attachment and would lash out. I just dealt with it and felt like I deserved it. Started pulling away because of it and she felt it. Did couples therapy and I could finally connect with my negative feelings about her lashing out but just focused on that and didn't think or care about her feelings of why she did it and decided ""I didn't want the relationship"" 

For the first time I'm actually feeling the love I really had for her. I haven't stopped crying since Friday. I'm beating myself up about all the times I was so close to recognizing that it was just my attachment style and if I did and talked about it with her we could've worked on it together. 

On the plus side I'm actually feeling my feelings more than I ever had so I guess that's good? I just wish it didn't have to take losing her. I saw her this weekend (it's been 6 months since the relationship ended) and told her all of my realizations and recognizing what was going on and was bawling. She gets it but is over it, she's focused on this new guy that has no hesitation in how much he wants to be with her, and the fact it took her finding someone else for me to even unload my feelings to her makes it seem more jealous/competitive than genuine. 

I just want to hug her and hold her and do the hard work to try to make it work but it's too late and I just can't handle it. I can barely eat and sleep. And I know I don't even deserve another chance because I realize now how terrible of a partner I was. I keep thinking about so many what ifs, and maybe this new relationship of hers won't work out, but that doesn't fix anything and just delays the pain if it does work out. It's just so shitty and I never expected to feel this much pain. 

I was so close. I read about DA attachment styles. If i just found this subreddit and posted during the relationship instead of after I might have actually had the perspective to know I needed to work on it and not just run.  But who knows, maybe I had to go through this loss to uncover these feelings and it would've ended up the same anyways. It's just the shittiest I've ever felt and it sucks knowing it's entirely my fault. I just try to remind myself that I wasn't in the place to be able to be present in the relationship the way I needed to be so I can't beat myself up, but I still feel so guilty because of what I did to someone that would've had my back until the grave and more. 

All this relationship can be now is a lesson, which is the most heartbreaking part. 

To those DA's on the fence in their relationships, you have to get uncomfortable and force yourself to put everything into your relationship. Don't just trickle it in while keeping them at arms length. You have to strip your soul open to them in the way that you feel like no one would ever be able to love or want to be with. On top of that you have to be honest with them because they can feel it. The hollow ""yes I love you too, I really want to be with you"" when you don't clearly feel that hurts your partner because they can feel it. They can see and feel it whenever you feel suffocated and put them as a second priority to everything else in your life. You have to be honest about those feelings and explain where it comes from and why you do this and then put in the work to fight against it, because anything else is just existing and not living.",qlgrjt,62,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/qlgrjt/she_loved_me_so_much_and_would_be_there_for_me/,AvoidantAttachment,0
122,So…How do you actually bring up things that bother you in a relationship? {fa},"This is starting to become a big problem in my relationship. I’m aware that it’s a problem, but I am immensely struggling to fix it. 

Also, this is really hard for me to be vulnerable over because it’s strongly poking my “I’m a shit person” wound. So please be kind. 

The background: I’m an FA (historically very avoidant - hence the conflict avoidance here. I have been more anxious lately though) with a history of family trauma with a lot of anger, gaslighting, and invalidation. 

The issue: I am finding it immensely difficult to bring up things that bother me with my secure partner, even though he always responds very reasonably, because I am so scared that he’s going to be angry or gaslight me. My difficulty bringing things up then spirals internally and it’s putting a strain on our relationship. 

The issue in more detail:
Here’s what happens. 

Boyfriend says something that bothers me (“That movie is so toxic, how could you like it?”). I’m immediately aware that I feel judged and criticized. 

I think to myself, I should tell him that I didn’t like how he said that. I take some deep breaths to calm myself, and plan the words in my head. (“Hey, I really didn’t like how you said that about the movie I liked. It really made me feel judged and like I can’t share things that I enjoy with you.”)

I try to say it. But first, my brain starts to prepare for all possible outcomes. What if he’s angry, what would happen? How would I respond? What am I going to do if he tries to convince me that’s not what he said? What it he responds kindly? And before I know it I’m building out an entire decision tree in my head so that I feel prepared for all possibilities. 

Twenty minutes have passed. I feel bad that I’m taking so long to bring it up. I worry now that he’s going to be angry that I didn’t bring it up immediately. I start building a decision tree for that outcome. 

I say to myself, I’ve got to stop this. Just say it. And it feels like I’m mute - my tongue doesn’t work anymore. I tell myself, count from ten and then say it. And nothing comes out. 

Thirty minutes have passed. I start to feel guilty that I find this so difficult. I start to feel ashamed that I find this so difficult. I worry that he’s noticing that I’m upset and try to hide it so that he doesn’t have to worry because it’s not fair for me to act moody when I can’t express why. 

Then I’m spiraling - I’m so ashamed of my inability to bring up minor things. I feel like shit about myself. I feel like my trauma is going to chase me forever. I feel like I’m never going to be able to have a healthy, communicative relationship. 

Here are keys: My partner has NEVER gaslit or been extremely angry with me. Those fears come from my past. And, when we actually get into discussions, we do fine. I’m able to express myself clearly and take critique and offer it when necessary. It’s just the damn starting and the spiral that happens. 

I am in therapy, doing EMDR for trauma. The only thing that my therapist seems to be able to offer me to help with this is “Keep working on the trauma, it will get better, and in the meantime, you just have to do it.”

But how??? How do I get over this when it literally feels like my voice is gone? I’m desperate for some strategy to help me do better here. I know this pattern is incredibly unhealthy and I want to change it for my own health and the health of my relationship.

126,"Are any of us, like… Actually healing?","I guess this is a rant of sorts but I’m also curious if anyone has any actual insight. Before anyone assumes I’m attacking anyone or the like, I’m actually commenting more on general community trends— ones which I am *firmly* rooted within as well. Mods: I don’t know how to set flair on mobile but my style is DA/FA.

But. Does it seem to anyone else that severe avoidants, especially DAs, just… don’t ever get better? I see so much discussion, either about avoidants or by avoidants themselves that seems to reinforce this. People saying things like “if he’s a DA, he’ll never change. Move on and find someone who’s able to give you what you need,” or “I can’t be enough for someone. Trying to be open and giving me love and presence won’t change this and so you shouldn’t even try”. And as an avoidant myself, despite all of the work I’ve done and books I’ve read and therapy I’ve paid for and Thais Gibson I’ve binged I… don’t feel any closer to Healed. In fact, quite honestly I feel dug further into my rut. 

I don’t seem to notice any improvement in terms of letting new people in. I’m only capable of letting myself chase my equally avoidant ex because he’s unattainable and therefore “safe”. However, I’ve felt anxiously activated toward him lately (remnants of FA), and that’s in turn led me to be frustrated with the fact that I can’t just *get my shit together and actually allow a man who actually likes me to be with me instead*. I’m crazy lonely. So much that it feels like dying quite often, and I kinda feel like I can’t take this way of being anymore. And yet I still can’t even let myself go on a date. I can’t even let a man TEXT ME. Casual dating or sex? Out of the question. 

How the hell do you fix this?! “Therapy”, sure but I’m in therapy and so much of it seems to be “And where do you feel that in your body? Wow, it sounds like you’re conflicted over whether or not to stay friends with your ex, because you care about him but it’s tough to ruminate and analyze everything. Ok times up, $50 copay now please. See you in two weeks”. And from what I see on these forums here, it’s a lot of “hey I relate, I wish I had advice but I don’t! Have you watched Thais Gibson?”. 

It seems to me from experience and observation that healing avoidance is much harder and mysterious than the other styles. I see so many people, I know a few personally, who just gave up and have lived decades without any significant partnerships. It probably doesn’t distress them like it does me, but it seems so sad! I don’t want to end up like that. But I used to have hope and I’ve had it stomped out of me and I have no idea how to get it back. Ugh.

128,You’re not alone,"Ever since I can remember, I’ve been full of doubts and fears in relationships, even those with the loving and caring partners I’ve been lucky enough to cross paths with. I’ve run away from way too many relationships that were absolutely fine, and I’ve got myself into some others I shouldn’t  have.

The Doubt starts when sh!t gets real. It’s like a chain of intrusive thoughts you can’t get rid of. I’ve pushed away and hurt people I loved because I thought I wasn’t able to love them to some arbitrary standard I myself had set in my mind, and out of fear of being rejected if they knew how I really am inside. And after the fact I was always able to rationalize and explain away why I left: because they were at fault of some defect, because I wasn’t really feeling “in love”, because If only I was able to find “the right one”, the person I could really  “connect” with and with whom things would be different… But then sh!t gets real and The Doubt starts once again.

I am fearful avoidant (or dismissive avoidant according to some other tests), and this has made me and others suffer throughout my life. I’ve only become aware of the problem, and started been working on it recently.

The key is, obviously, awareness. I’m learning to stop monitoring my feelings constantly or comparing them to some arbitrary ideals I can’t measure up against, and that only exist in my mind as a barrier I myself create to guard off real intimacy and authenticity. I’m starting to cut through “relationship OCD” and its chain of relentless draining intrusive thoughts. I’m learning to give love without wondering if the other person will ask for more, or wether I’ll be engulfed by them or wether I’ll be up to the task of giving love back. I mean, if you give love, you’re clearly up to the task. And love, at the end of the day, is what we do to make other people’s worlds more beautiful, and not necessarily some fuzzy warm feeling in our hearts we should constantly look for or monitor ourselves for. I’m not a fraud when i do things for love, regardless how I think it should “feel” inside. I am capable of giving love. I am deserving of receiving it. The effort pivots around lowering the walls we ourselves build around us, and let it flow without constantly questioning and judging ourselves. I know I can do this. I Also know it requires awareness and effort. I also had (have?) ADHD. This is just how my brain works.

I’ve found mindfulness helps a lot. For one thing, you watch your thoughts - and your fears- from the “outside”, and you embrace them without judging them or identifying yourself with them. They keep changing. You aren’t your thoughts. Books, therapy and a vital crisis also helped to go look within. And oftentimes I didn’t like what I saw.

I need to stop monitoring my mind and obsessing about what I “should” feel, because I can always find perfect excuses to withdraw love (and to withdraw from it) when The Doubt creeps in (and it almost always does at some point). I won’t ever be 100% sure if my “feelings” will seem “adequate”, because, funnily enough, the one who’s in charge of discerning wether they are or not, is none other than the severe judge I carry with me at all times, but f*ck that noise:  it’s the things you do for others what count. That’s real. So I just need to stop keeping myself from doing them. I’m learning.",px65zp,62,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/px65zp/youre_not_alone/,AvoidantAttachment,0

130,The problem with boundaries,"It is becoming apparent to me that the major gulf between attachment style groups is really one of boundaries. 

To better understand our relationships with others, I think all people in this sub should start by understanding themselves first. There is a constant theme of trying to understand other people, or asking us to interpret the behaviour of another person, or trying to control other people, but very little reflection on one's own behaviours and thought processes, needs.

To really understand a romantic situation, I think we need to reflect on  whether our boundaries are appropriate, how we are communicating them, and how we react under pressure.

**Prepare for shitty analogy**
Weird analogy but picture two people dancing with crinoline. In a perfect relationship, the two hoops should be delicately touching, but not invading. If one partner is too invasive, their crinoline will knock the other one's balance. If they are too far apart, they are dancing alone. The trick is to constantly navigate each other's crinoline while in movement to ensure that the correct balance is maintained. That is how healthy boundaries should look.


**My observations:**
People with avoidant styles tend to have firm, close boundaries and short leashes. Their partners find those boundaries unclear because some people have trouble expressing them. The dance partner has no idea they are stepping on their crinoline. So they are constantly bouncing off each other, and the avoidant has to step back to recalibrate. Instead of asserting boundaries, they react: they pull back, they disappear, they panic, leaving their partner confused. They recalibrate/reassure themselves by stepping back. Why? Because avoidants have restricted limits it is natural to avoid violating the boundaries of others. This also includes making decisions about people based on their behaviour rather than expecting them to change.

People with AP attachment styles have the opposite problem. Their boundaries often seem more loose, they are willing to let people violate their own boundaries, or to be enmeshed with a person just to feel secure. For them, when they feel anxious attachment, their reaction seems to be enact control. If they are knocked on the dance floor, they lurch forward to grab on. They reassure/recalibrate through control of other people, demanding things of them. They do this because they themselves have loose boundaries, they  think others should too. They are unstable dancers and want you to dance nose to nose so if you don't they feel secure. 

Secure people can navigate these boundaries because they know their own boundaries, are firm and flexible, and reassure the other person without allowing their limits to be violated. They are also good communicators and can get the information needed to ensure harmony.

Avoidants with APs is a disaster. Avoidants pull away to recalibrate, that causes APs to lash out and violate boundaries all together to recalibrate, which only causes greater resolve to pull away by the avoidant partner. The whole thing devolves really quickly.

I personally think that if people want to understand the problems in the relationships, they need to first understand their OWN boundaries and how they interact. When you adjust yourself, others will adjust with you. It's not a question of understanding other people or demanding that others change. It's a matter of looking at yourself and then looking at how the other person responds. If the relationship is not satisfying to you after you have done what you can, then you have to step away rather than expect to change the person. I think doing so would reduce a lot of the questions that appear here.",r4srfl,61,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/r4srfl/the_problem_with_boundaries/,AvoidantAttachment,0

133,Avoiding Reciprocity and Self Sabotaging {FA},"I had a new memory from childhood coming to the surface that had turned into a breakthrough in my therapy sess today, and I would like like to share and see if others have had any similar experience.

I had a chaotic home where our family dynamic in attachment was extremely insecure, there was emotional abuse too, but in kindergarten I met this teacher Ana Lucia, she was kind, she was gentle, she was attentive, understanding, she was the only one that had stand up for me with some of my mom behavior, as a kid it felt like protection, it felt like I deserved her and the “secure” feelings she brought to my child self, I adored her.

 When kindergarten ended, and I had to start pre-school she wasn’t the teacher or there anymore… I lost the only person I felt “safe” with and treated me with kindness, I felt abandoned  and it did hurt more than the neglect I suffered at home, it was like I have never deserved Ana Lucia! 

After that I don’t think I had attached to any other adult or kids my age very well and it indeed pushed my attachment to greater sabotage, until two years ago I would date people that didn’t treat me right or had nothing in common with, people that I wasn’t attached to, because of the fear of hurting more by dating someone whom I actually liked and wanted to be with. I think “losing” Ana pushed that part of my attachment.",13er0x1,59,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/13er0x1/avoiding_reciprocity_and_self_sabotaging_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
134,My avoidance is my prison {FA},"Last night was not an easy night. I think both my boyfriend and I were triggered and feeling not good enough. I think for the most part, we operate really well together. We manage to talk through a lot of issues. We have the same goals for our relationship. We both agree we’re moving towards living together. 

But we have this one major sticking point that keeps coming up again and again. It makes me feel like I’ll never be good enough for him, and when I voice my concerns over it he then feels like he’s not good enough for me. 

In all fairness, he said he’s trying but is a slow learner when it comes to emotional things. Which is true. He compared the current situation to how it took my breaking up with him to realize he needed to change. 

Anyway. There was a moment last night where I thought it would be the last night we spent together, the end of the relationship. And inside me I could almost physically feel the walls reappear. But I realized that I’m not building walls up to keep other people out. I’m slamming the walls down to keep myself in. 

I realized that my avoidance is just me looking myself up in a prison. I exist as two people. The logical thinking hardened-by-trauma warden and the emotional connection seeking prisoner. 

The warden has given up. It knows that other people can’t meet our needs. It knows that other people betray us, that we aren’t good enough. That we’ll never be good enough for anyone. 

The prisoner still has hope. Still feels like maybe someone could love us enough to stick around even though we’re damaged. 

The problem is that neither actually controls the locks. The only people with the keys are the same people that can hurt us. They unlock the cell and the prisoner tentatively leaves. We start to care, we start to hope, we start to relax. And then reality smacks us in the face. People inevitably prove that we aren’t good enough. The warden throws the prisoner back in the cell and slams the walls down. And then it yells at us. “How could you put us at risk like that?! How could you make us unsafe? How could you let someone see how broken we are?” 

And the cycle repeats. Ands it’s all my own doing. 

For a while I thought maybe I was finally free. Maybe I finally met someone who would stay even when they saw the worst of me. Maybe I finally met someone who would love me as I am. But now I’m back to just feeling like I’m not meant to find happiness or a healthy relationship. Maybe it’s time to give in to the avoidance.",w1ldz4,59,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/w1ldz4/my_avoidance_is_my_prison_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
135,Most guys give me (26F) the ick {FA},"Most guys I date give me the ick. Like I just suddenly feel like I’m not attracted to them and I want nothing more to do with them. It’s very much a feeling of disgust/repulsion. 

For example, I went on a date with a guy a week or so ago and it felt quite nice at the time. Neither of us are looking for a relationship. I spent the night around his and felt pretty positive about it after. But since then I’ve developed the ick. Like I feel like I’m not attracted to him. Certain mannerisms. I don’t like how he’s keen to see me again. I don’t like the flirty messages he’s sending. I don’t like the pressure to be flirty back. I don’t like the idea of having to make time for him and reply to him. I don’t like the idea of introducing him to my flatmate. 

Idk how I’m going to tell him because he’s really keen and has recently been through a breakup so feel like it’s shitty time to reject him.

136,{DA} Ive made progress!,"Long story short im 31 and Ive always struggled with being dismissive and ghosting/fading away or what i also call “getting the ick” out of nowhere in relationships, especially when they show an increased interest and start showing more emotion im assuming its from having completely emotionally unavailable parents. For some reason i have an issue with 3’s. 
Once i hit 3 weeks, 3 months, i start struggling really bad to stay present with people. Haven’t figured out that one yet. 

However, i have been in a really healthy relationship with a new guy, and i just passed the 3 month mark with him without wanting to get up and leave. 

It wasnt easy, i had a few days off and on where i could feel myself starting to deactivate and give myself excuses to leave. But, I pushed through the feelings and basically told myself to knock my bs off and that there was literally nothing wrong with him. Even when i didnt want to answer the phone, i did. Even when i didnt want to answer messages, i did. I felt exhausted but i kept pushing and basically dragging myself by my own arm. I communicated with him during such episodes and he was very patient.

137,"I am sick of other people, mainly {ap} but also {sa}, treating us and describing us as if we were subhumans","Every time I watch YouTube videos like the ones posted by the Personal Development School channel, every time I read articles on the topic, every time I scroll through whatever gets posted on other subreddits dedicated to attachment styles, every time I read books like ‘Attached’. 

We avoidants are labeled as “cruel”, “abusive”, “heartless”, “harmful”, “cold”, “incapable of feeling emotions”. We are depicted as if our only goal in life was to destroy everything around us and hurt the people who love us. 

I have read so many comments under Thais Gibson’s videos, for instance, where the poster would describe their avoidant as a monster and would advise everyone else to stay away from people like us. Comments that get thousands of likes. It does nothing but further enforce the belief that I hold and that I’m desperately trying to get rid of - that I in fact don’t deserve to be loved. 

I realize how painful it can be to deal with DA’s and FA’s, but why can’t anyone bother to extend us some kindness and compassion? Doesn’t it cross their mind that some of us may just be “damaged” human beings trying their best to navigate life? Why do they always have to make it seem like we choose to be this way, rather than understanding that our behaviors and worldview stem from our often traumatic past experiences? Why do they always need to repeat that there’s no hope for us? 

You may tell me to just ignore what they say and focus on my own healing process, but the truth is it’s so hard to keep fighting against the voice in my head saying that I’ll never be good enough when I’m constantly surrounded by others claiming the same.

139,War {fa},"Being FA feels like being at war with oneself. There’s complete opposite sides battling each other. For me, when I finally succeed and lose contact with a person and they respect my space, I lose it. I get anxious, needy and my brain says “you have to win them back and think about person 24/7”. There’s no winning.

When I’m with someone I want to push them away.

When I get enough space or time (usually no contact for 6-8 months) I’m dying to get them back.

It’s exhausting and I never know which side of the battle to listen to.

143,Adult Attachment (activation of the attachment system) {FA},"Hi y’all, I am reading this book about clinical implications of adult attachment and would like to share this interesting figure. 

This is what was wrote in the page before the figure for more contest: 

Page 20-

“This model (see figure 2.1) includes three components. The first component involves the monitoring and appraisal of threatening events, which can lead to activation of the attachment system. 

The second component involves the monitoring and appraisal of attachment-figure availability and is responsible for individual differences in the sense of attachment security. 

The third component involves monitoring and appraisal of the viability of proximity seeking as a way of dealing with attachment insecurities. This component is responsible for individual variations in the use of hyper-activating or deactivating strategies of affect regulation. 

The model also includes excitatory and inhibitory “neural circuits” (shown as arrows on the left-hand side of the diagram) that result from the recurrent use of hyperactivating or deactivating strategies, which in turn affect the monitoring of threats and attachment figures’ availability or unavailability. 

According to this model, individual variations in self-reports of attachment anxiety and avoidance reflect the underlying action of hyperactivating and deactivating strategies. 

On the one hand, self-reports of attachment anxiety reflect the appraisal of proximity seeking as a viable option, which leads to increased efforts to attain closeness and support by insistently expressing vulnerability, need and anxiety. The main goal of these efforts is to get an attachment figure, who is viewed as insufficiently concerned and available, to pay attention and provide protection. The basic means for attaining this goal is to maintain the attachment system in an activated state until an attachment figure is perceived to be available and responsive. These strategies involve physical and psychological proximity seeking, heightened vigilance regarding actual and potential threats, and intense monitoring of attachment-figure availability or unavailability, because these cues are highly relevant to security attainment. 

On the other hand, self-reports of attachment avoidance reflect the appraisal of proximity seeking as a nonviable option, which leads to defensive independence and self-reliance, denial of attachment needs, and suppression or deactivation of attachment strivings. This deactivation effort includes the downplaying of actual or potential threats and refusal to monitor the availability or unavailability of attachment figures, because thinking about threats or attachment figures might reactivate the attachment system. “

144,{fa} How to communicate about moving slowly in dating?,"Hey everyone,

I've noticed when using dating apps that most people seem to move pretty quickly, at least by my standards. For example, texting at least daily (often multiple times a day) and wanting to go on dates 2-3 times per week. To me, that feels like going from 0 to 100 and it makes me stressed out. It takes me quite a while to warm up to strangers and integrate new people into my life. 

I would much rather slow down at the start, and go on a date once every week or two and maybe text a couple of times per week. I'd be happy to ramp that up to daily contact and more frequent dates, but I usually reach that point after 2-3 months or so - around the time when people usually define the relationship and go exclusive.

I'm just wondering, how do I communicate this respectfully to people, without making them feel like I'm playing games, keeping it casual or just not that keen? I'm wondering, is it better to tell people directly that this is my preference, or is that overkill?! I'm FA so I tend to get anxious and overthink everything.",12je908,59,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/12je908/fa_how_to_communicate_about_moving_slowly_in/,AvoidantAttachment,0
145,"How do you get started on ""fixing"" avoidant attachment? {DA}","I hope this is an acceptable post. Please remove if not. 

I've been aware of my dismissive avoidant attachment style for about a year now. I desperately want to work on it, but I don't really know how to start. 

Brief background: I have one cold, detached parent and one explosive, abusive parent. Oldest child. I have had one long term relationship that took a huge toll on me. The relationship was with someone who was very controlling and abusive. Romantic relationships are off the table for me. Too much risk for uncertain reward and (in my mind) definite abuse. I love my autonomy and I don't see a scenario where I'd give it up. 

I've read lots of books about attachment theory. I've had bouts of therapy: one lasted about eight months, the other only a few weeks. The main theme in both the books I've read and what I've gotten from therapy is ""date and try it out,"" which isn't something I feel comfortable doing. It's 50% an ""I don't want to"" thing and 50% an ""I don't want to subject someone to my bullshit"" thing. No one deserves to be my dismissive avoidant guinea pig. 

I know I need to find another therapist, which I'm working on. Any other suggestions on where to start? After the volume I've read and the therapy I've had, I'm starting to lose hope.",115yuxg,59,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/115yuxg/how_do_you_get_started_on_fixing_avoidant/,AvoidantAttachment,0

147,I actually caught myself deactivating in a big way and turned it around {FA},"Holy cow, I caught myself deactivating!   
I got a comment about my \[reconciled\] relationship in another thread, asking if I catch myself slipping back into old patterns, and the answer is yes. A lot of them have been smaller. Fleeting thoughts, a way of structuring questions and sentences that is self-protective, etc. But a bigger, more nebulous, more potentially catastrophic one just dawned on me yesterday!  


In the first round of this relationship, I deactivated by fixating on physical attributes, sexual performance, sexual compatibility, etc.—deciding that these were all problems, namely, problems that I needed *him* to fix/work on, or else things probably couldn't work. Anytime I evaluated the relationship, which was almost always, I'd come back to ""ugh, but/and the sex problem! How can we ever possibly get through that?"" And I'd get so deflated and bummed out.  


 In hindsight, I wasn't putting in any relational labor to work on them myself, which is bullshit. And, though I wouldn't have been able to see it at the time, they just weren't really problems. I'm actually incredibly physically/sexually attracted to my partner when I'm not deactivated, and though we do have different *flavors* of sexual desires/preferences... I would say that most couples do?  I just had always managed to find partners in the past who somehow completely aligned with me sexually (but not at all in other ways) and so wasn't used to difference in that area. And they weren't even astronomical differences—not mutually exclusive needs/incompatibility—just some different kinks and turn-ons. Somehow this became an emergency.

Now it's actually *fun* for us to play around with a wider array of sexual scenarios, catering to one or both of us, rather than us just being completely aligned and having a narrower sort of thing we fall into. So basically, I made up problems to hyper-focus on and end the relationship over.   


Ok, so we're a year into our reconciliation now and things are by and large going great. But I've found myself fixating now on a new set of perceived ""big problems."" He's moody, often grumpy, and low energy—especially the first half of the day—and to me, it feels like there's just ""always something"" wrong, like some physical discomfort that he's blaming everything on and fixating on and can't ignore and it just kind of takes over the entire mood of the house. I've found myself sinking back into ""this could not work after all, how could I possibly live this way, what will this look like in ten years, etc.etc.etc.""  


But one thing I know about myself is that I have poor psychic boundaries. I take on others' problems. When he's moody, I'm moody. It only takes over the house because I allow it to. I either take it personally or I'm just bummed out/sick of it. I start thinking about how *not* moody I am when I'm single (which during some phases has been true, but during other phases, completely *not* true... and I remember these distortions from previous deactivations, how much ""better"" single life was or how much ""better"" some other fantasy partner could be.) Sometimes I try to fix or manage it for him. I point it out, make suggestions, get bummed/irritated when he doesn't take them, etc. Or else, I want to remove myself, go on a walk, go see friends, and just completely bail essentially until he figures it out and realizes he's affecting me and ""gets his shit together."" But the bailing won't stop the bad feelings towards him, I'll just be thinking about how I had to get out because of his shortcomings, etc., and things most of the time won't feel resolved when I return.  


It's important to say that there's a big BIG difference between how I'm *actually* handling these things from last time to this time. I'm not threatening to end the relationship, not actively considering ending it at all, I'm staying loving, connected, communicating, etc. So it's much, much better. But that fixation on ""the problem"" (to make sure I always have a good reason to end things if need be?), not actually constructively contributing to solving this problem for *me*, and the boundary issues of making his problems my problems are still showing up.  


And yesterday I saw it! I'm totally slipping into deactivating! As soon as I saw it, it just cleared away like a mist. He can be moody, and actually, his moods aren't even that bad. He doesn't take them out on me, he's just quiet and not very conversational/responsive, and usually noticing, like I say, some physical discomfort and kind of fixating on it. ***Like I don't have my own neuroses?!***   


I can ask him if I can do anything to support him, and let him know I'm there? I can occasionally open up about how it's affecting me if I need to?   


But like, I don't have to take on his moods, AND I don't have to run away in order not to. I can keep working on these fucking mental boundaries. I don't have to fix it, *he* doesn't even have to fix it.  I don't have to even worry about it really. ""Oh, he's in a mood again. Anyway, moving along..."" Working on having that psychic boundary where he's in a mood and I'm generally around to help out if needed but otherwise living my life... not removing myself/cutting off emotionally AND not inserting myself/trying to make it go away... It's really not that big of a deal. And it could just be a phase he's in. He just started a new job, for example, after a long period of being self-employed. There are other big changes happening, and it's been a year of huge change for both of us in general. I can chill out. I can let him have his problems. I can love him with his problems.  


Anyway, wow, it feels so good having seen that pattern early on and just having it disappear as soon as I recognize it. I'm sure it'll happen again, with something else, later. But hopefully, I just get really good at catching it.",xyu4nv,58,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/xyu4nv/i_actually_caught_myself_deactivating_in_a_big/,AvoidantAttachment,0

Saying “I got it” when someone tries to help me with something, for example, getting groceries out of the car.

Giving affection, but feeling weird or feeling nothing when receiving it (this used to be much worse when I was younger. It’s like I couldn’t stand being touched/hugged).

Feeling like I could be a hermit and be fine with it.

Switching the conversation onto the other person when they ask about me (I realize I do this impulsively most times).

149,I feel like becoming more avoidant has made me a much happier person {FA},"I’m FA, currently leaning DA. Though until about a year ago I always leaned AP. When I leant AP I literally felt constant anxiety around relationships. My self-esteem was in the gutter. I felt so desperate to be in a relationship and have what others seem to have. I felt very strong negative emotions most of the time. 

Since becoming more DA I’ve been happier than I’ve ever been. I feel emotionally regulated 95% of the time instead of 10%. I feel better about myself than ever before. I feel completely comfortable not being in a relationship. I’m so much happier without that constant anxiety and worry hanging over me. 

I think it makes it difficult to feel motivated to change. Because from my perspective, being avoidant works out a lot better for me than being anxious ever did. And right now I don’t particularly feel like I’m missing out on anything. And it’s hard to think about trying to become more secure, if that means risking activating my anxious side again and going back to more how I was before. I’m just not sure for me that right now the pros outweigh the cons.

151,Receiving = Losing,"Just had a good therapy session and thought I'd share a nugget:

It seems I have zero space between receiving something good that I want and the assumption that I will lose it/it won't last/it's not reliable/I can't trust it/etc.

I think in the past the translation has been so instantaneous that it sounds like, ""That would hurt so badly to lose so I should just leave it."" So I never go for it in the first place.

I never let myself imagine that I could just get something good and it might stick with me.

These days I'm starting to imagine it and let things in, so now the transition is just a little bit slower than instantaneous, ""I want this so badly, losing it will mean..."" 

So I think a goal for me is to work toward leaving a little bit more space for sitting with the idea that I could get something I want, appreciating what I have before I lose it, and just generally staying with wha the current situation is rather than what I assume it will be.

152,Secure leaning AP folk are great for avoidants,"I noticed that I have a great deal of secure leaning AP people in my friendships. Some of these people have been in my life since they were full blown AP so I can confirm they come from deeply insecure roots.

I think they are great for avoidants because they are willing to create more ""relationship glue"" than just an outright secure/leaning avoidant. For instance, I've mentioned a number of times that some of these friends send ""good morning"" texts but at the same time, sometimes they don't send it or sometimes they don't respond to mine or vice versa. But since they're secure, no one cares and whoever remembers just sends another ""good morning"" text the next day.

They're the ones who will be by your side and show you the ""softer"" side of humanity (they remember your birthday; when you're sick, they're more likely to do something for you or follow up with you; they ask you how you're feeling, etc; willing to do favors for you).

They're also the ones more likely to share their deep feelings with you and help you process your own but won't ever pry.

153,Rant about avoidant-bashing {fa},"I hate seeing comments people make about avoidant people. I understand that people feel pain after being hurt by someone avoidant and they wish that that person went through therapy so no one was hurt. I get that and empathize with that and I wish they weren’t hurt either, truly I do. But unfortunately we live in a world where none of us are ever perfectly healed, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t deserving of love. People talk about avoidants with such vitriol and it makes sense when they’ve been hurt, but it is so painful to read. I hate stumbling across comments like that especially when I’ve been doing better. All it makes me feel is that I am not deserving of love, I never will be loved, I will always fail people, I deserve to be hurt and lonely, etc. and all of it just instantly makes me want to avoid more. I want to be able to reach out to people and share myself and talk about the things that are hard for me and be vulnerable and try even when I am so so so scared, but how can I let myself take those steps when I am so afraid that finally sharing myself will result in the exact thing I am so afraid of: people telling me I don’t deserve love and rejecting me. I have to remember when I brought up a comment that I told my therapist about that was talking about avoidants with the same vitriol and disgust and pain, and I remember she told me that the comment in itself actually seemed quite avoidant to her. I don’t completely remember what she said in her explanation or what she meant by that, but I think it was something along the lines of choosing anger and rejection of an entire group of people rather simply allowing yourself to feel sadness for the fact that you were hurt, that you were in pain. I truly feel for these people, and I’m not just saying that. It is painful to feel like someone is running away from you and rejecting you in that way. I have an intense fear and panic around rejection, and avoidance within a relationship can so often feel exactly like a rejection, so I get that, I really do. It’s just painful to struggle so hard with something, to feel like something has ruined your life, caused you to fail classes, quit jobs, distance yourself from friendships, never try to find a lover, has pushed you to the furthest brink of trying to end your life, and then on top of that have people say that this quality that has hurt you and your own life so bad has also made you fundamentally unloveable, that people deserve better than to put up with you. It really is painful. I’ve been in therapy for so long. I have made so much progress. But I am so scared I am still never going to be good enough for people. That I never can be. That people will always look at me and decide I am not worth the effort. I am not even worth it to try. And I hate that voicing any of this only makes it seem as if I only care about my own pain, and that I see it as more important than the pain of anyone hurt by some avoidant, and I don’t. People around me will tell you I am the first to advocate for people going to therapy and working to try to heal themselves instead of trying to use a relationship to make themselves feel better. I don’t think people who have been hurt should just automatically forgive the person who hurt them and reject all of their own pain, nor should they be responsible for “fixing” anyone or continuing a relationship with someone who is not putting in the effort they desire/require. I just wish people would stop talking about avoidant people like they are some vile, heartless monsters who only care about themselves and are only capable of hurting people. I wish people would stop talking avoidants like they cannot be deserving of love. That’s it.

154,"{FA} We both said “I love you”, and now I’m kind of spiraling","So… I have wanted this for a long time with this person. Historically, I am quite closed off and try so fiercely to avoid getting particularly attached to anyone at all costs, but this time was different.

To clarify, this person is a “friend” (best word I can give to describe our relationship in more conventional terms). There is no chance that this will ever culminate into a romantic relationship, which both my friend and I are aware of. Still, I never get this close to literally *anyone*, so the interaction still ultimately felt incredibly intimate to me. I should also clarify that this wasn’t a mere exchange of a casual “I love you” between us (I know some friends casually exchange such sentiments with each other, but this was different. We both said it very seriously, not in a casual or lighthearted way whatsoever). 

Anyways, now in the aftermath of it all, my brain is somewhat freaking out about what the fuck just transpired between us. I can’t even begin to describe just how much *panic* this has already evoked from me. It’s not the sort of anxiety an AP has though, where they are anxious because they fear losing the relationship… rather, my anxiety feels like it stems from this alarm ringing in my brain which is screaming at me, “*I don’t know if we can tolerate the idea of someone loving us, of allowing ourself to be genuinely loved.*”

There is this almost instinctive urge to reject the love, to try and diminish it, to talk myself out of it… anything to make it go away, because sitting with and attempting to tolerate these feelings of love make my entire being feel unsafe, as if it is threatening the very fabric of my existence.

This whole experience is making me realize just how entangled I am with this idea of being alien, how so much of my identity has been founded upon how “rejected” and alone and miserable I am. Maybe this will sound fucking ridiculous to some people, but I know deep down I am soooo intensely attached to this core belief that I am unloveable, and even though parts of me have yearned for years to be loved, there are *many* other parts of me which are violently resistant to the idea that anyone could ever love me in any sort of real, enduring way.

So basically, right now I am trying to force myself to sit with this feeling of love from my friend and with the immense amount of anxiety which accompanies it, because I am so beyond tired of my own self-perpetuated misery. That being said, though, I am also absolutely, undeniably *terrified* to sit with this love, to allow myself to accept the depths of my vulnerability and my reluctant, latent neediness to be loved… on some level, acknowledging my very real desire to have loving relationships with others feels so repulsive and disgusting, but ultimately I feel like I need to forge ahead and properly process these feelings once and for all.

I don’t know what exactly I’m looking for here, but if anyone has any words of encouragement or a similar experience I would appreciate the support or advice. 

I just… I really want to allow myself to love her too, to not let our mutual affection for one another passively slip away… I want so desperately to transcend these pieces of myself that have only helped to perpetuate my misery and loneliness for years.

I deserve to feel loved,… right?",119iyki,56,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/119iyki/fa_we_both_said_i_love_you_and_now_im_kind_of/,AvoidantAttachment,0

156,Avoidant's pain,"This will purely be a rant/vent/story.

Some of you guys may recognize me by my comments and posts. You guys often tell me how self-aware I seem. For that, thank you very much. Despite this, I'm still deeply avoidant.

While chatting with one of my good friends here, I remembered how in the past, I've done the horrible thing of getting on with someone with everything going perfectly fine and then ""the talk"" happens. And in the past, I've disappeared with little to no explanation.

In this case, I did like him. I liked him enough to be scared to hurt his feelings by confessing that I wasn't ready for what he wanted. In this particular case, I felt zero resentment towards him. Just fear. And of course I felt awkward and guilty afterwards especially because I had to see him almost every day. I wouldn't be surprised if he wondered the same as you guys, ""how could she suddenly flip the switch?"". I made it ""unhappen"" as I put it.

He did nothing wrong and I don't think we argued once. It's just... I can barely describe it. I hadn't even thought about not wanting to be with him anymore up to that point. It just seemed like no other way out at the time. This was many years ago and if I remember correctly, he just let me be and I was... so thankful for that. However, there was one thing about him that I couldn't decide if it was a deal breaker for me. That's why I never revisited the relationship.

I've been the architect of this scenario a number of times. Many times actually with many different types of people.

I was listening to someone's issue with their former avoidant partner and they read the book ""Attached"". They really felt if their former partner read it, they'd see how easy it is to resolve their avoidant issues as the book apparently gives examples of how to do so.

Guys... as someone as ""self-aware"" as myself, I can only say my avoidant issues have gotten worse. I mean, taking advantage of opportunities to communicate how I feel and my boundaries have gotten much, much better. I'd never ghost someone I was involved with again and I'd be fully comfortable giving them an honest explanation.

You know what's gotten much worse? My fucking heartache. It can be easy to forget that an avoidant person has feelings whether or not they can identify what's going on with them. So you can give me all the tools in the world but changing my inability to feel shit is hard. And when I do fall for someone, it's very hard when I lose them because I don't get to feel connected to someone too often.

As much as I have worked on myself, practiced communicating, and exposed myself to others for the opportunity for connection, I've still found myself arriving to the same conclusion: I should quit love.

I should quit love because if I do that, I won't ever have to feel this pain again. Solitude is a very safe place for me. Am I insecure? I don't know, I just feel frustrated and exhausted and like, I don't really feel like getting my heart ripped out of me again.

Most avoidants have at least one deep wound (usually multiple). If you're like me at all, your mind erased some of those memories for you!

So I'm not afraid of anyone messing with my autonomy or my space. That shit will absolutely not happen. I'm tired of people falling for me and not being able to reciprocate. I'm tired of missing someone else when I can't reciprocate.

Avoidants are just built different, guys. You really wouldn't understand because we hardly understand ourselves a lot of times.",q4epwl,56,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/q4epwl/avoidants_pain/,AvoidantAttachment,0

163,Feel myself getting the ick {FA},"I (28F) have been on three dates with this guy. I felt like we clicked personality wise and initially found him quite attractive. I stayed round his place last night (but didn’t do anything sexual). All was fine until this morning when I felt like I’m bordering on getting the ick. 

I think I just feel uncertain about whether I feel attracted enough to him. I think to a degree based on physical attraction but in a larger way worried we won’t be that sexually compatible. 

I think that makes me feel really anxious. I think it’s the fear of feeling trapped into something where I feel uncomfortable. I know most people’s approach would be to just keep dating and see how it goes. But it scares me because I don’t want him to become more invested then hurt him by cutting it off. Or the bigger thing is I’m scared of things escalating sexually and feeling uncomfortable but feeling too awkward to stop it. 

I find it incredibly hard to say no in sexual situations. So in the past I usually just go along with it feeling uncomfortable and then cut things off afterwards via text. But that is obviously not a pleasant experience for me. 

So idk whether the ick is partly a result of an issue with setting boundaries for me. I feel like I focus in on flaws and potential incompatibilities and it gives me a really strong feeling of anxiety/disgust to try and protect me from that situation of ending up in an uncomfortable sexual situation with somebody. Which ultimately is because I have no faith in my ability to set boundaries because I’m a people pleaser and am really scared of letting people down. 

I don’t really know how to proceed with this situation. I’m supposed to stay round this guy’s house this weekend (where I feel like the expectation is for things to escalate sexually). I did think there was potential between us. We click well and I enjoy time with him. He’s very available and consistent which is refreshing (idk if that’s part of the ick problem in my mind too though). 

I’m just sick of being in this cycle of getting the ick with people who could be a good match and who are more available. Bc then I only pursue unavailable and inconsistent people and it never goes anywhere serious.

166,"The downfall of being the first to ""earn"" secure in an insecure relationship {FA}","I want to start by saying that I firmly believe that you can turn a relationship around when only one person starts off doing the work. I actually think that's how it ends up going most of the time. One person gets tired of the dynamic, learns to be healthier, and the second person follows lead. 

With that being said, it isn't an easy feat at all. I'm realizing how much our childhoods and core beliefs really impact our every day lives. My own healing journey has been near torture trying to unlearn those beliefs, coping strategies, and insecure behaviors. I've been in therapy for over 3 years straight now and multiple modalities (talk therapy, EMDR, DBT) and it still is an almost constant struggle fighting against those old beliefs. I'm sure at some point it gets easier, but these negative aspects of me had decades to hunker down and make themselves comfortable. I imagine it's going to take more than a few years to really make progress. 

And I have seen progress in myself and the relationships around me. I've seen the relationship with my kids improve as I become more sure of my parenting. I've felt better in my relationship with myself as I learn to advocate for me and trust myself. I've seen my FA boyfriend go from being completely unable to label our relationship to talking about moving in together and marriage. We have this undeniable commitment to each other, and I know he loves me. I know I love him. But is that enough?

We've been struggling a lot lately. I've seen sides of him that I haven't seen before. Sides that, to me, seem to be subconsciously testing that commitment and unknowingly self sabotaging. Sides that have triggered my CPTSD in ways I thought I had worked past. We seem to be in a constant state of conflict these days. Either he's not happy with me or I'm not happy with him. I often feel like I'm having the same conversation over and over again and just hitting a wall. 

It's almost like we're both navigating these booby traps that he's set up to keep himself safe, but he did so so long ago that even he doesn't know what's coming. And I truly can't put all the blame on him, because if I was as secure as I thought I was I'd probably just walk away at this point. Instead I spent last night trying to convince him that we should basically demote our relationship back down to ""fuck buddies."" Why? Because my attempts at direct communication aren't working, and I'm not sure what else to try than to sabotage the thing myself. He responded to this attempt with ""Dismal, if you want to break up with me, you're going to have to do it. And not in some round about way. You're going to have to actually say it, because I'm not going to. It's not an option for me."" 

I've had a few mental breakdowns lately, feeling so overwhelmed that I just fall into hysterics. And I realized it's my own inner child treading water and losing that fight. Learning to navigate the world after finding out I'm autistic and being slapped in the face with how much that actually plays a role has been hard. On top of that, healing all of this avoidance and anxiety and learning how to have a healthy relationship is essentially a complete reparenting of my inner self. Trying to do that while also ***actually*** parenting 3 kids - without any help from their dads - and who were also just diagnosed as being autistic themselves is an added layer. Then also realizing that being the more secure person in an insecure relationship *that you want to last* essentially means reparenting your partner as well... I'm desperate for an adult to swoop in and save the day. An adult that's not me. Someone who can just come in and even for just 5 minutes say ""Dismal, I got it. Just breathe for a minute. Rest."" 

I can see this attempt to center myself again is taking its toll on my boyfriend and our relationship. I feel myself inching closer to that ""big boss deactivation"" as I like to call it, where I shut down all feelings and move on. I am becoming angry. I had to figure this out on my own - why can't he? But fuck, isn't that how we got here? Having the people who were supposed to be there for us basically saying figure it out on your own? 

This man quietly asked me, ""Have you ever had a puzzle and you just know that these two pieces go together, but you can't make them fit because whoever made the puzzle messed it up?"" Maybe it's not that they weren't made right. Maybe the previous owners didn't take care of the puzzle. And now it's covered in dirt, and torn, and sticky. And in order for the pieces to fit together like they were meant to, you have to take the time and energy to restore them to their original selves. 

I've been trying to restore the pieces in the same way for months now. And while I've made some progress, there are still obviously issues. Maybe it's time to get more creative in my approach. Maybe I've been trying to fix us as if we are adults, but we're really not. We're two hurt kids stuck in adult bodies with adult responsibilities, and nothing is safe but each other. 

I'm working to find compassion today. Compassion for myself. Compassion for him. Compassion for the histories that got us where we are. How can I be angry at him for not healing on my schedule? How can I be angry at him for not making progress in the same way as myself, even though he IS making progress? How can I be angry at either of us when we're just doing the best we can with the examples we've been shown? 

I'm grateful for the spotlight this is placing on me, showing me exactly where I still need to heal.",117lrh3,53,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/117lrh3/the_downfall_of_being_the_first_to_earn_secure_in/,AvoidantAttachment,0
167,Anyone want to try an experiment this week with me? {FA},"So a while ago when I was looking for books I briefly passed over The Five Second Rule by Mel Robbins. It seemed like an interesting concept, but not something at the time I was looking for. The end of last week, I came across her in a TikTok explaining how it worked. Basically, when you have a negative thought or don't want to do something, you count backwards from 5 and that helps you do the thing. She says that counting backwards somehow interrupts the negative thought patterns we have and helps us reprogram our brain. 

I've been in a very ""it doesn't hurt to try"" mood lately when it comes to healing. I've been listening to affirmation lists while I sleep, doing some yoga stretches to try and release my hips/psoas, and journaling. I figured it doesn't hurt to try this 5 second rule. So this weekend I implemented it. I have a lot of executive dysfunction and can sit doing nothing productive for hours while my mind reminds me of all the things I should be doing (laundry, dishes, etc). So while I was playing a game on my phone, I had the thought that I should get up and sort my laundry. Normally I would just shove the thought away, or tell myself ""Five more minutes"" or anything I could to put it off. This time I counted down from 5, and I actually got up and did it. 

So I tried it with my kids. My three year old asks for help all the time, and I'll do the same thing - tell him in a minute, and then kind of hope he forgets. Or get frustrated that he even asked. So every time he did, I counted down from 5 and DID IT. With very little internal resistance. Every time I used it, I was able to act differently than I normally would. And it felt really good. 

Now I'm thinking ""How can I use this to my advantage when it comes to my avoidance?"" I think there are a lot of times that I want to text or call my boyfriend and I don't. I let myself fall into that negative thought cycle - I don't want to be a burden, if he wanted to talk he would have reached out, he's probably busy, it's not important, I'll be rejected, etc. What would happen if I counted backwards from 5? What if suddenly I stop avoiding so much? What if I actually started to connect more? It doesn't hurt to try, right? 

I thought it might be cool to see if helped others as well. Is anyone willing to give it a try with me this week and report back on progress? I think having some of that accountability will help be more consistent with it.",y0dlno,52,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/y0dlno/anyone_want_to_try_an_experiment_this_week_with/,AvoidantAttachment,0
168,"For {DA} women, it seems different (to me)","I don’t think gender is brought up enough in terms of attachment styles, but in my opinion, makes a real difference especially re: insecure dynamics. For reference, I am a late 30’s DA cisgender woman. I’m wondering if any other DA women relate or have any input on this. 

I get the impression that the “typical” DA is generalized as an emotionally unavailable man, an enigma, a guy who is just focused on his career and can’t commit. Or some variation of that. But as a woman, it seems a little different. 

If we women are not paired up and having babies by a certain age, we could be seen as:

- a spinster 

- a closeted lesbian 

- something seriously wrong 

- abnormal

- lonely cat lady

Now, I do acknowledge this has gotten better in many ways and I personally don’t hear it as much, but that might be due to where I live and the people I surround myself with. The idea pops up in my head every once in awhile though and it didn’t come out of nowhere, as I did grow up hearing from many sources what the role of a woman was, and also grew up with a religious mother, (don’t even get me started on that.)

I think with the #metoo movement, recent political events in the US, as well as having many more platforms on which women can speak up, the ideas of who, how, and what we should be have changed since I was a kid. And that’s where my confusion lies when the generalization about DAs is that we are specifically attracted to APs. 

As a woman in my late 30’s, I can confirm that is absolutely not the case for me. So, DA women who date men, are you attracted to APs like the stereotype states?

I do not at all mean this as a knock on men or AP men, I am simply stating from my perspective as a DA woman who dates men, that the more anxious traits in an AP/anxious leaning man, can come off as unsafe, whereas I wonder if it’s the opposite for DA men dating AP women. 

I mean, picture the quintessential protest behaviors, as well as some of the “monitoring” that goes on by the more severely anxious, and put that in a large, tall, muscular body with a deep, booming voice and I’m sorry but it’s a lot scarier. And genetically speaking, men are typically stronger or the degree of strength they can attain is much higher than an average woman (whatever that means anymore.)

Regardless of attachment style, my experience as a late 30’s woman is that there are certain red flags we should look out for now that maybe wasn’t the same for prior generations. Maybe I’ve watched too many episodes of *Dateline*. Maybe all of the dating strategy books aimed at women clouded this for me. Perhaps what society has told us about what a man should be like (low on emotions, strong on all levels, stoic, breadwinner, decision maker, (insert generalization here) has clouded it. But I personally cannot tolerate someone, men especially, with significantly fluctuating emotions, anyone who seems like a Jack in the Box, anyone who *needs* to know my location, my personal inner thoughts, to whom I have to “prove” my devotion to over and over so they can feel good… it’s just…goes against my conditioning. 

Therefore, I think it can be difficult to tease out the difference between avoidance and social norms as a woman.

169,I successfully battled through some of the stickiest anxieties I get in LTRs {FA},"I'm in an LTR, in some ways a new one and in some ways an old one (long story), and I am beginning to work through some of the stickiest anxieties that lead to my avoidant behavior. Had a big win on Sunday that I wanted to describe.

**First, I'll describe the crux of the anxiety:**

I woke up with relationship anxiety: a sense of guilt and obligation the very second my brain came online. This is an extremely familiar experience for me in LTRs. I wake up really really early, in part because I like to have quiet alone time before my partner gets up. It feels like church. It's when I'm at my best and most expansive for the day, and it's really important to me. I stretch, meditate, write, read, stare, drink tea, pet my dog... But I have not had much good experience with partners handling this, and/or me responding to their super normal behavior out of fear of it impinging.

Some partners ask me what time it is or mention something we have to do that day or otherwise bring the weight of the world crashing down on me while I'm still momentarily free of it... which I hate! Others want me to stay in bed to cuddle, talk, have sex, whathaveyou. Others ask me to do something like get them a glass of water or something. Others seem to actually resent the fact that I want this time/am taking it. Some have even found ways to protest it (like getting up and flipping the lights on and banging around and trying to talk to me while they know I'm meditating.) Some ""slept in"" even when they wanted to get up because they were afraid of me.

My DA ex was the best because he just slept in haha.

My response to these things contributes to the issue. I get really grumpy and dismissive about talk about the day ahead. I sneak out of bed and flee the room to avoid cuddling or being asked to do anything at all costs. I combat and fight people who resent my routine and ask them to stop doing the protest behavior and outline how ridiculous it is instead of having any curiosity of what's behind it.

So most mornings for the last 8 years in LTRs I've woken up with anxiety. So many mornings I have literally tried to move my body centimeter by centimeter for like 45 minutes so that I can slip out of bed and out of the room in one smooth, quick, movement to minimize the chance of interactions (which feel like ""getting de-railed."") When my partner does get up, I feel in some ways like ""the magic time is over."" If they get up pretty soon after me, I feel deflated.

And the worst part is, I'm on edge during the time I most enjoy as a result! Tip-toeing around and sometimes feeling resentful.

(sidenote: this total fear and extreme avoidance of any and all interaction is so very familiar from my childhood... I would hide in the bathroom as much as I could (take baths for hours, pick at my skin in the mirror, ""have to pee"" a ton during the day, just to get some respite), turn on the radio as fast as I got in the car to avoid talking, stop joking around and laughing with my sister the second my mom came home and turn on the TV and sit in silence so we wouldn't have to talk to her, literally feel like I *snuck* around my house my entire time growing up... not because my mom was mean or threatening or angry or anything, just overwhelming and needy.)

**And now the win:**

On Sunday, I felt that overwhelming anxiety and strong urge to flee the room. Then I was able to say: ""this is just because I don't trust myself to uphold boundaries or meet my needs if there's an interaction."" So I made myself instead stretch in bed, roll over and cuddle (because I do actually like to cuddle!) and give my partner a kiss on the cheek because it makes him feel good, then I left the room at a normal pace. It was ok. I survived.

Since then, I've been doing more of this. Sometimes he does say some words to me. If it's something I want to talk about later, I can say ""let's talk about that later, my mind is still too fresh,"" then give him another kiss. I still feel the triggered response in my body, but overall it works! I'm not completely ruined by the very suggestion! Sometimes he does want me to cuddle—one time, I felt like I wouldn't mind a couple minutes of it, so I did it, and one time I said, ""I really want to get up and stretch, but I love you,"" and kissed him. Again it seemed to be fine.  Today when he got up he came in and greeted me, then went back to bed sort of talking on his way there. I usually feel sort of obligated to go back to bed briefly and interact when this happens, but when I evaluated it, I didn't want to, I wanted to keep working on what I was working on, so I did. I think he noticed that I didn't do what I usually did and maybe felt sad that I didn't come to bed. But he can request that using words if he ever wants it bad enough. Basically, we survived.

**Then the day continues...**

Once we're both up and it's tea time, there's another wave of anxiety, but less intense. He's spacey and starey and goofy and often talkative in the mornings, whereas I am truly in my best creative brain and want to use it (to get ideas down in my journal or explore thoughts, to do some deep reading, or start working on something.) But when we're sitting at the table, I feel like I need to interact with him or entertain him or let him try to entertain me or otherwise ""connect."" It's really, *really* hard for me to keep focusing on what I'm doing at all when he's there, because I just feel like he wants things from me. I usually just set my work aside and engage kind of out of guilt, but as a result I feel like I miss some of my own best energy for the day and I get resentful and soon enough I want more mornings alone and am being harsh about boundaries (which are actually just walls since I'm not setting any boundaries) and soon enough want *every* morning alone...

On Sunday after my bedroom win, I decided to *make* myself keep doing what I was doing. We had some interaction, which was fine with me, because  I kept returning to what I was doing. I'm shocked how hard it was. Like bending a limb the wrong way. But I persevered! Like what I do when I'm alone, I started out just kind of letting my brain rattle out in writing and reading, then that spiraled into figuring out the next steps to take on a project, and kept with the momentum and started work for the day *but did it in a separate room for the first time ever with this partner*—following my own preference. I worked there, *efficiently and with inspiration*, in his house until early afternoon. We had some interaction and it was ok and actually *nice*, because I trusted I was staying true to myself and what I wanted.

Later in the afternoon he spontaneously said to me, ""I love how you're kind of just doing your own thing today!"" And he meant it! My brain nearly exploded. This feels like a huge win.

171,"{da} It frustrates me that avoidants are pretty much always seen as the perpetrators and anxious people are always seen as the victims. We’re evil and manipulative, they just “love too much”","I’ve been talking to my ex about our 4-year relationship and why it ended. I did some bad things and was maybe 80% why it failed - I deactivated, would do my best to distance myself from her frequently, I was secretive and occasionally I’d do fairly egregious things to see if she would call me out. But in the entire relationship she almost never seemed unhappy.

It turns out there were loads of things she was unhappy about but kept hidden because she didn’t want to start an argument or potentially break up. For a whole two years she was saying to her friends “I think he’s cheating on me, I don’t think he loves me any more” (I was not cheating on her and I did love her), yet not once did she ever express those feelings to me. I’m not sure what I did to set that off, but had she told me about them we could have confronted the problem. Maybe we wouldn’t have been able, but that either prolonged a relationship that was doomed to fail, or just let a solvable problem simmer.

Another time, I mentioned I was going to a female friend’s birthday party instead of hanging out with her and instead of telling me what she was feeling she freaked out, called that girl up and called her a whore and had a panic attack. She apologised for that - to me and my friend, but had I known she was insecure about that friend I probably wouldn’t have gone, or I would have taken her with me.

Point is, I did some bad things in the relationship. I didn’t express my needs and boundaries and it led to me distancing myself from her. But her failure to tell me and have conversations when she was feeling anxious or worried also either prolonged a doomed relationship or stopped a bad one becoming good. And that’s also bad.",wgrdg3,52,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wgrdg3/da_it_frustrates_me_that_avoidants_are_pretty/,AvoidantAttachment,0
172,Trust | {SA} {DA},"A short one from therapy today. We were talking about a general fear of betrayal, but it definitely pervades in romantic relationships. 

She told me that she regularly reminds clients to be in the relationship with the person as they are now. Not in the past or future. Usually for her clients this looks like folks who want/hope for their person to change in the future when it’s not evident. But in our context, we were talking about whether or not I can trust people not to betray me in the future. Her point was for me to look at things as they are now and not make decisions based on what could theoretically happen, or the history that someone may have had— if it genuinely seems they’ve grown past that history. 

Maybe this is total common sense, but it was a revelation for me.",ugyls5,51,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ugyls5/trust_sa_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0

174,The Avoidant Goodbye,"In the past, when I was unaware of my avoidant behavior, break ups were a source of relief and peace…for about a few days. I was really just relieved to get away from the confinements of intimacy that felt overwhelming. I would always end up feeling terrible when the reality set in. 

Recently, I was able to let someone in fully and enjoy the depth of the connection we shared without fear. Mostly, in part because I knew she was moving. But when it came to the moment of separation, I didn’t find myself relieved that we wouldn’t be around each other anymore, I felt sad. I felt those real emotions that I would have buried before only to deal with later. And in that sorrow, I actually find real peace, that we shared a connection that the pain of separation is real regardless of how I manage it, and that pain is much more easy when accepted up front. In the end, the connection is worth that pain.",r7gbyq,47,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/r7gbyq/the_avoidant_goodbye/,AvoidantAttachment,0
175,"{da} cPTSD, wanting to ghost everyone I’ve gotten close to. How do I stop hurting people this way? What is it that keeps happening and why?","Originally post in ptsd and traumatoolbox:


Background: held captive ages 10-16 by abuser, ya get the severity 

Fast forward now, I’m 21 and miraculously doing very well considering what I went thru largely thanks to dedicated agents from the FBI and homeland security and my family. These people were seriously committed to my case and were able to actually put the guy away for a very long time. I go to school and study electrical engineering,I climb ice, am getting into alpinism and generally do extreme outdoors things, I think it’s a product of a heightened fight or flight that I can’t get over. 

Anyways! Now to the part I really need some advice on…

I didn’t know how to socialize with other people since the abuse happened at ages where you usually learn that type of thing but last year I managed to make real friends, it didn’t feel like I had to fake it around them the whole time and I think I’m getting to that point with some people this year too. My problem is that when I get to a certain point my gut reaction is to disappear for a few weeks to stop getting close to them. I’ve been seeing a guy recently too and it was nice, fun, relaxed at first when I didn’t think I liked him that much but after having a few really fun times with him something in me changed. I feel less relaxed and less able to joke or be myself around him, I feel pressure for some reason and my gut reaction is to ghost him (he’s my neighbor so I can’t tho, shouldn’t anyways). Can anyone help me put what’s going on more concisely/help me figure out how to work thru it? I don’t want my relationship w him to be ruined, or my other friends for that matter. This happened last year and I fully lost the ability to be myself/relaxed around the people I got close to and ended up confusing and hurting people. Any input is appreciated

176,I think part of why I get the ick is because I find it difficult to say no to sex {FA},"I (27F) was thinking this morning. I’ve gone on a few dates with this guy, and we’re planning to go on our fourth tomorrow. I feel somewhat under pressure to have sex with him (as he’s said he wants to). 

The thing is I like his personality and do think he’s an attractive guy. And I am open to getting to know him more. But idk yet if there’s any sexual chemistry between us. And I know the only way to know is to try it out. But I’m scared that tomorrow I’m going to feel pressured to do sexual stuff and that if I don’t feel the chemistry I’m going to feel really uncomfortable during it. I feel really anxious. 

In this kind of situation I always feel pressure to just go along with it. Which feels really uncomfortable. And then there’s the element of he’ll probably expect me to stay over at his place. But if I’m feeling uncomfortable I won’t want to do that. 

Basically, I find it really difficult to say no. Because I feel like the other person has certain expectations and I feel a lot of pressure to go along with it. I don’t want to upset them or let them down. I find it hard to say no even if I’m very distressed with what is happening.

I think this is part of why I’m so sensitive to getting the ick and why I cut people off early in dating if I have any doubts. Because I’m scared of ending up in this situation where I feel trapped and uncomfortable and end up feeling like I have to do stuff I don’t want to do. I’ve been in this situation many times. 

Any advice for how to deal with this? And how to take steps towards making it easier to have boundaries and to say no?

Like, I get in theory that I don’t owe them anything and I have every right to say no at any point. But I just can’t bring myself to.",yr9rbv,50,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/yr9rbv/i_think_part_of_why_i_get_the_ick_is_because_i/,AvoidantAttachment,0

178,New here. Avoidant (I think {FA} but not sure). I'm sick of the panic. Need support desperately. I don't want to be a monster anymore. Also willing to answer any questions that partners of DA/FA have.,"**Tl;dr: I've been a workaholic for the majority of my adult life to avoid intimacy. In a healthy relationship and I think about breaking up all day every day. I'm scared and exhausted.** 

Apologies in advance for the extremely messy novel but I have not really been able to talk about this with anyone and I am so desperate for someone to just tell me that it's going to be okay and that I can stay with my partner and that it can get better. 

\---

During the pandemic I entered into a relationship. I was lonely. At first I tried to push her away because I really just wanted to have sex and hang out and be casual. She took that really hard and said that she felt a real connection. To an extent I did too but she scared me. I usually choose people that I perceive to be ""worse"" than me — people much dumber than me or much less attractive, etc. so that I can remain in control and always have the upper hand. She was too close to my level and that scared me. She's smart and successful in her career and more attractive and she's a genuinely good person with a good head on her shoulders. 

Within a few months we were hanging out just about every day. I liked having her around. She became a great friend and the sex was fantastic. We were silly and we laughed. She made me feel young. She made me want to be a better person. We're not a perfect match in terms of the things we find funny or the shows we like but we have great conversations and agree on the important things and we support each other. Normally I get sick of people extremely quickly but I never got sick of her. I was really confused why she liked me and wanted to be around me, but she did. 

Despite how great it sounds, the entire relationship, I've felt this low-burn anxiety that I just can't seem to shake. It's uncomfortable. I've started picking her apart and trying to regain the upper hand so that if she leaves me I can say ""oh, well, she wasn't that great anyway."" The anxiety is relentless. I'm kind of ruining the happiness that this relationship could bring to my life by worrying so much. I've always been convinced that getting married and having kids would mean I was just like everyone else and that I wasn't interesting. Relationships have always felt like a prison to me. I want to put my whole self into my career and traveling and just be free. But in reality, when I was single I wasn't happy either. I wasn't traveling or working any more than I am now. And my partner is really adventurous, so we adventure together. Realistically I know that I am still interesting and career-driven. 

In reality, I know that being in this relationship is basically holding up a mirror. When you keep people at a distance, you can let your delusions run wild. In my mind, I am perfect. I am better than everyone. Smarter than everyone. Talented. Have tons of potential. Just need to be left alone so I can bask in the glory of being that person. Except I'm really just a regular person. And the delusion is what keeps me safe. But she sees me at my best and at my worst. She sees me for what I really am. And there's nothing wrong with me. But I am just... normal. A normal person with a normal life. I am an extreme perfectionist and accepting that fact is terrifying. 

Throughout my life (due to what I believe is being on the spectrum) I have felt that I was cooler and more interesting than I actually was. I got rejected a lot by people with whom I thought I had a connection. My parents were very narcissistic and delusional in terms of my ""abilities"" and ""potential"" — they isolate themselves so they can pretend like they are better than everyone else, and blame others for their failings. I know I do the same. I am having trouble accepting that I am just a normal person with normal person problems. To me, if I am not exceptional, I am unworthy and unlovable.

I recently quit my job because I was working a really unhealthy amount and kind of letting the relationship rot. In the last few weeks since I quit I have been thinking constantly about breaking up. It's all I can think about. I feel like breaking up will allow me to regain a sense of comfort because I am *so* uncomfortable and anxious all the time. I don't want to break up, but my mind is convincing me that she's not right for me and that there is some perfect person out there that would be better. 

Most relationship advice really doesn't help because people tell you to trust your ""gut"" but my gut, historically, is not to be trusted. My gut literally tells me to run away from all intimacy. It tells me that I won't be worthy until I'm working at my dream company making a better salary, until I lose weight and have the coolest friends. I feel like I will be chasing this until I die. I'm constantly chasing approval. I'm also craving the explosive chemistry that comes from an unhealthy relationship because it's exciting and fun. I'm feeling kind of stuck in my career after working at an overly demanding, really low-quality work role and I'm having trouble regaining my identity as a high-quality professional. Essentially, I'm falling apart and instead of putting the anxiety where it belongs in my career and health, I'm tearing apart my relationship because it feels like a safe, familiar place to hold my anxiety. 

Does anyone ever recover from this? Will this anxiety ever go away? I feel like she doesn't deserve to be dealing with my shit and she deserves better. I'm just a monster that shouldn't be around anyone.",u7c8ec,52,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u7c8ec/new_here_avoidant_i_think_fa_but_not_sure_im_sick/,AvoidantAttachment,0
179,{fa} People on dating apps...do you go in and out of phases of being really open to meeting people and then feeling disgusted with the idea? Or is this just me?,"For awhile I've felt pretty chill and open to going out with people, and kinda magnetic and excited about it. I had 5 dates with 1 person, but our 5th date was awkward af and they barely talked, nor asked me anything, so I think it's a mutual fizzling out and I'm just letting them slide outta mind. Easy peasy time with that. 

Some switch kinda flipped though, about the whole dating thiiing, I guess, and now I'm considering deleting my profile, feeling confused about whether I'm even attracted to the people that ""liked"" my profile. Some of them are ""attractive enough"" overall, but then in another moment, I'll switch how I feel, looking at them like ""eh, nah""...

I feel like I have such a hard time telling whether I'd match with someone unless they're really physically attractive right off the bat....even though, kinda ironically, I feel mostly demisexual, requiring getting to know someone a good deal before feeling physical attraction to them. 😅 

Not sure if this makes sense, ha. It can be difficult to articulate the nuances and shifts of emotion/intuited feelings/sensations since realizing I'm a fearful avoidant. 

I swear I'm not just superficial either.  I take a reeeally long time, relatively,  to even feel open to making the move to kiss someone.

183,My relationships always end up looking like the dynamic with my dad {FA},"I’ve noticed my (28F) pattern is to only really feel attracted to people who are inconsistent, distant and emotionally unavailable. 

The dynamics always end up so similar to the dynamic with my dad. Where they let me down, don’t make effort or time for me, are distant, avoid talking about issues, and are inconsistent. They’re always super nice and great when we’re spending time physically together. But then so distant the rest of the time. And during the times where we’re together and they’re being nice I just forget about the stuff I’m unhappy about and don’t want to spoil the nice quality time. Only to be left feeling crap again when we are apart again. 

I immediately get the ick if someone gives off signs of being anxiously attached. My mum was very overly emotional, unstable, dumped too much stuff on me and was way too enmeshed with me even I was a kid. Which I think now has made me super sensitive to feeling smothered or like someone is restricting my independence or asking for too much from me. 

I feel like maybe I haven’t met that many secure people. Or if I have, I tend just not to feel a spark. And if I don’t feel a spark with someone initially but still try to persevere there’s no saving it. 

Which leaves me feeling like I don’t really know what to do. I can’t force myself to feel attracted to someone if they give me the ick. And no amount of trying to talk myself round or persevere gets rid of the ick. 

Do I just hope that I meet someone secure eventually who doesn’t give me the ick? I’m tired of these same old patterns playing out. I want to be with people who actually want to spend time with me and who actually make me feel cared for. I want intimacy and closeness and security in a relationship but I’ve never had that before.

184,How can I “prepare” for deactivation? {da},"I have been seeing a lovely girl for a few months. I have gone through the cycle of feeling really connected and attached, but then deactivating after a couple of weeks and feeling the urge to break things off or distance myself. This has happened 3 or 4 times. Each phase is a couple weeks or so.

The last time I deactivated, she had kind of had enough and told me we should stay friends. That was all well and good for a while, but of course my feelings for her grew again, and in no time we ended up back in each others arms.

For the past week and a half, I’ve felt totally in love with her. I love her personality (and so do my friends and family), her style, her big pretty eyes… the list goes on and on. Right now, she feels like sunshine to me.

But I know this deactivation pattern is sure to repeat. I am in therapy right now, and my therapist has advised I adjust my expectations. I feel naturally attracted to her when there is no expectation and we’re just hanging out as friends. When I feel like things are going somewhere, my feelings shut down because I become afraid of what that might mean, or getting trapped in a relationship. So maybe taking things more seriously triggers me to panic and then deactivate.

I really think that she is good for me, and I truly feel like I can ease the fears that cause my deactivation in time, but I am still feeling helpless to control it.

tl;dr: I am feeling very connected to a girl I am seeing, but dreading the impending deactivation.",vs0e1k,49,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vs0e1k/how_can_i_prepare_for_deactivation_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
185,{da} I like a guy. He likes me back. I'm grossed out.,"I know a lot of you have similar things happen (which thank you for being vulnerable & sharing because it makes me feel so much less alone).

I liked this guy for a while - I finally get to spend time with him. He's cute, funny, seems like a good person but he's been flirting with me more and the instant it became definitely obvious to even me (who is typically very oblivious), I instantly was disgusted. This has happened with eveeeerrry guy I've ever liked in my life and I've in the past found something bad and used it as an excuse to push them away/friendzone them. I don't want to do that anymore because obviously I liked this guy beforehand/found him attractive so please help lol. I know I essentially just need to force myself to get through it because I'll be happy I did but any any advice or pep talks to get through the grossed out/scary path to relationships are welcome 😭😭

Edit: I thought this was supposed to be a supportive community? Totally understand that some of you think I may have self-esteem issues or whatever else (and I appreciate those of you who are actually trying to help and offer suggestions because that could def be an obvious answer) but the comments that are just like ""are you sure you like yourself"" are getting a little frustrating. I definitely love myself, I'm almost certain. So unfortunately, if that was the easy answer to why and how I could fix this behavior, I would whole heartedly embrace it, but unfortunately - not the problem. I think so often in these communities, everyone assumes DA's dont love themselves and therefore can't accept love. While that may be the situation for some DAs, it definitely isn't for all of us. I'm looking for honest good solutions to help the ""deactivating"" part as someone helpfully pointed out to me that this is what this was called.

186,Subreddit Reflections,"What a rollercoaster the last several days have been for attachment subreddits!

This subreddit is and has always been about Avoidant Attachment. In the past, it was not super busy, and the posts were overall respectful and on topic, as far as I can remember. 

Then, OTHER subreddits tightened their rules, that included not allowing posts asking for relationship advice, psychoanalzying a partner or ex, break up advice, venting about a specific attachment style, etc. (Hmmm, I wonder why they had to do that?) 

And guess what happened. Like a tidal wave, users started to flood this subreddit with posts that were not allowed in the place they used to be able to post them. ""Business picked up"" you could say, which lead to an influx of inappropriate posts, avoidant hate rages, dehumanizing comments and posts about avoidant people...you get the picture. What was a subreddit that didnt require too much moderating at all, became a place where avoidants did not feel comfortable, and it became a place where primarily one style would come to vent their frustrations and ask for mindreading or to talk about their breakup. Avoidant participation decreased substantially. 

This is NOT and never was a breakup subreddit, nor is it primarily relationship advice or dating advice (although of course that comes up when you talk about your attachment to others), nor is it an unsent letters subreddit. There are a multitude of these subs already in existence. To keep this subreddit on topic, rules were revised, and were TRANSPARENTLY posted. You can search u/[**kyondayo**](https://www.reddit.com/user/kyondayo/) post history to see the timeline of events if you're so inclined. 

Despite that, the flooding continued to occur at an unmanageable rate, and several avoidant users were providing feedback that this was still not an avoidant friendly place. That was something that was taken very seriously. You see, we are exposed to hatred on youtube video comment sections (even the PDS helpful videos has a cesspool comment section). Many other attachment groups, forum, and content is also full of avoidant hate. Even a lot of the literature out there paints avoidant people in a negative light. We're ""exposed"" to the ""other side"" and the opinions of others everywhere we go, and the negativity outweighs constructive feedback. Healing becomes even more difficult when you're surrounded by people kicking you when you're already down. 

As a result, a poll was made, and you can see the results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/pxxyk1/whats_the_purpose_of_this_sub/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  where the majority said they wanted only Avoidant OPs and others could comment. 

Once those rules were implemented, it worked only so far as users honestly set their flair, as you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/r47n6h/relationship_posts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Despite all of the transparent communication, the avoidant hatred and rule breaking continued, which led to allowing certain users to only be able to comment in the Monthly Relationship Thread.

So here we are. I repeatedly read here, feedback from both avoidant and even secure members who say that this subreddit produces high quality content, insightful posts, and stimulating conversations. Anything to the contrary is minimal. I've also read and received feedback that this seems like a real community, and that warms my heart, and I personally agree. Others may have certain expectations of what this group should be or should not be, and they are entitled to that opinion, but since all rules have been implemented and our space protected, the avoidant participation has skyrocketed, and that in itself is a success and a testimony to healing. We all have different ways in which healing is needed, some of us need a support group of others who understand us. Especially given what I've already outlined above. 

Some call it an echo chamber, and that's fine. To those I say, we are not you, and you are not us, our needs are obviously different than yours, and we do not need to conform to others' expectations of what or who we should be. 

 I can assure you that we are missing out on very few helpful outside ""opinions."" I see first hand in the moderation queue the post and comment that are attempted, in which there are a few helpful ones, but the majority are comments that do not support or address the OP at all, show that they didnt bother to read the rules, or they hijack the topic and ask for relationship advice, or they simply say, ""you sound just like my ex who ruined the relationship!"" on a post where OP has outlined their mistakes and asked for help.  I will also spare you all from outlining a lot of the hateful comments we still get here, but I will say that there are a few that frankly sound like something I would expect to hear out of the mouth of a person who ends up on Death Row. And let us not forget that this isnt the only place that avoidant people can read or get opinions. It is ONE place, but not the only, so those worried about our echo chamber miss the fact that any of us can expose ourselves to any level of outside opinions at any time elsewhere, no one is trapped here. No one is forced to read this subreddit if they do not agree with what is going on here, either.",u0lmgu,49,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u0lmgu/subreddit_reflections/,AvoidantAttachment,0
187,FA feels like the worst of both world {FA},"I (28F) have recently been trying to start dating again but I already feel so disheartened. 

It’s very rare for me to feel attracted to someone. I’ve maybe felt a proper connection with a handful of people in my life. But it feels like these people are always very unavailable. They don’t prioritise or make time for me, they’re inconsistent and they keep distance between us. And I accept it because I feel like I can’t do better and I feel like they’ll leave if I demand more (and this has been the case a few times). I already know this mirrors the dynamic I had with my dad growing up a lot. 

Whilst I think I have a lot of nice qualities and have a lot of deep friendships, I feel like I’m unloveable in a romantic sense. I feel like no-one wants me, apart from for sex. I feel like I’m not good enough for anyone to choose me or want more with me. And that’s been reinforced by literally countless experiences (whether with parents in childhood or with romantic partners over the last ten years). 

I see friends who have partners who love them and would do anything for them. I want that closeness but I just feel like it’s never going to happen for me. 

I know that some of the things that I’ve been doing are self-sabotaging. I know that part of the problem is my attraction to unavailable people, and the fact that I accept the bare minimum or less from people because I feel like that’s all I can get. I feel like I oversexualise myself to get people to stay because I feel like that’s the only way they’ll want me. But that leaves me feeling more used and worthless. 

I feel stuck though because I feel like I can’t control who I’m attracted to. Sometimes I chat or go on dates with people are more available and interested in me. But every single time I just feel like we don’t click. And if I don’t feel a ‘spark’ early on, then the thought of intimacy with them gives me the ick. This feeling of repulsion sticks with me even if I try to give them a chance and go on more dates and try being physical with them. And then I feel worse in the end because I feel like I’ve put myself in uncomfortable situations and not honoured my feelings. 

I think part of it when someone is forward and very interested in me is that I just feel like for them to be that interested in me they must be very desperate, which turns me off them. 

But I realise with this pattern I end up just dating unavailable people, accepting the bare minimum, and then continuing to feel crap about myself. But I honestly don’t know what to do to change it. I feel like I can’t control who I feel attracted to. I keep hoping that if I keep dating I’ll eventually find someone who is available and who I click with. But it’s been 10 years of dating and that’s never really happened. 

It just feels hard being FA because it feels like the worst of both worlds. With unavailable people I feel attracted but very anxious. With secure or anxious people I get the ick. There’s no real healthy inbetween. Idk if anyone can relate or has any advice?",15169vc,50,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15169vc/fa_feels_like_the_worst_of_both_world_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
188,"{FA} {DA} - Introversion, Avoidant Attachment, or Both? I don’t know whether I am being a bad friend or setting boundaries/expectations.","I am a friendly person but I regularly get socially exhausted and feel Icked out by people reaching out to me. Lately I have a handful of friends and have 1-2 people asking me to hang out per week. I hate it. I have been dodging texts, I’m filled with so much dread. I tell them no I don’t feel like hanging out but setting the boundary every week with one friend or another is wearing me down to have to say no the next time. I wish everyone would leave me alone.

192,Denying feelings - is this normal or avoidance? {FA},"Recently reflected on a joke my friends make about how I always say I don’t have feelings for someone only to admit it months or years later. I’m just really not ready to commit again so I hook up with people casually instead. Admitting feelings is scary. Fear of loss. 

The jokes do make me laugh tho: “You’ll be at the alter in a wedding dress still saying it’s jUsT FriEnDs WiTh BenEfiTs” lol… 

But in all seriousness. Here are some examples. 

Example 1: with one casual partner 2 yrs ago, we saw each other almost daily and did date-ish stuff for several months. It was obvious to everyone else I was into him but I denied it for MONTHS. Just kept saying I liked him as a friend but didn’t want to be with him. I eventually admitted it and dated for a year.

Example 2: broke up with ex 3 years ago. We stayed v close friends. He finally moved away last month. I am now experiencing intense sadness and missing him and our relationship. First time I’m admitting that he was probably the best it’ll get (he was secure but he just made a mistake in the relationship, but we were super compatible, best friends, etc). It’s taken 3 YEARS for me to get to this point. 

It’s not like I don’t have *any* feelings, but I just say I don’t want to be with that person or have loving feelings. Instead I claim just having caring feelings and liking them as a person. I’ll maybe admit even having a crush but maybe I’m still downplaying? 

Anyone else do this? Is it always unconscious? Am I overthinking it and pathologizing myself needlessly? 

I sometimes feel like we over-use attachment labels but in this situation it does kinda seem to fit avoidance with the select individuals who I’ve slept with for extended period…",w8kawl,48,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/w8kawl/denying_feelings_is_this_normal_or_avoidance_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
193,Do your attachment wounds kick in more when someone doesn't respond well to bids? {FA},"If you aren't familiar, bids for connection comes from Dr John Gottman's work. Here's a brief description. ([Full article](https://www.gottman.com/blog/want-to-improve-your-relationship-start-paying-more-attention-to-bids/))

*""Gottman refers to bids as “the fundamental unit of emotional communication.” Bids can be small or big, verbal or nonverbal. They’re requests to connect. They might take the form of an expression, question, or physical outreach. They can be funny, serious, or sexual in nature.*

*For example, your partner might say, “Hey, whatever happened with that situation at work with your manager?” or, “Do you want to talk about our plans this weekend?” or simply, “Can you pass the water?*

*...*

*There are three ways you can respond to a bid:*

1. *Turning towards (acknowledging the bid)*
2. *Turning away (ignoring or missing the bid)*
3. *Turning against (rejecting the bid in an argumentative or belligerent way)""*

&#x200B;

I shared the above article with my boyfriend. Every now and then one or both of us will mention bids. ""I'm making a bid."" or ""Respond positively to my bid!"" It's definitely in a positive way, and something we now use to connect more. 

But since sharing it with him, I'm realizing that first of all - literally everything is a bid. It obviously doesn't just reply to romantic relationships. I've tried to look at my kids in this context and not get frustrated because they're just making  bids for connection. It's helped, but I have more work to do. 

Second is that when someone responds by turning away or turning against multiple bids in a row, I'm instantly triggered into my attachment wounding. Especially as a hypervigilant FA. I notice literally everything. And I know you aren't supposed to but I can't help but 'keep score' in the sense that I know when it's happened more than once in a row. 

Thinking back to my childhood, I feel like it was really rare that as a kid my parents turned towards my bids. My boyfriend asked me last night to share a childhood memory and I struggle to come up with one that involves my parents (unless it was a traumatizing event). I feel like I spent a majority of my childhood fending for myself. So I guess it would make sense that someone turning away/against a bid would trigger my attachment wounds.

199,'Mind-reading' vs empathising {FA} {DA} {SA} {AP},"This is a bit of a meta post today and a discussion about a topic which (rightly!) comes up a lot in the subs - that we can't (and shouldn't) mind-read someone else inappropriately.

Mind-reading is discouraged not least because it is a cognitive distortion (Dr. David Burns expands on this in his CBT research), but also because reducing this fosters space to have actual healthy open comms in the understanding that *we do not know someone else's internal reality* and that we can be curious and ask them (which they may or not be honest about, sure, and/or give a certain level of detail that they consent to you knowing or not knowing). Point is, that mind-reading could be somewhat.... inaccurate? A bit of an 'intrusion'? 

There's a lot of merit in this, especially giving someone the opportunity to share what they are comfortable with, which allows for authentic connection to be built upon.

Now, there's some logic also to wondering what is happening in someone else's world, especially if they are not particularly 'forthcoming' (which is always going to be relative) so perhaps considering potential possibilities is quite useful in some instances. But we must be mindful that this is not necessarily based in *reality*. And if we make decisions on unverified information, this can be a recipe for disaster.

 (keep in mind the difference between: 

'X may be feeling XYZ rn but i can't be certain. I wonder what's going on in their internal reality. There are many potentials here and I'm nervous to ask them bc I understand I'm not entitled to every bit of their experience, but I would like to ask if they're willing to share with me. This is uncomfortable for me but i will sit in this discomfort and notice how it feels for me for data and when i have enough info about how i want to play this i will make a decision (this data may include *not* getting any data from them)' 

and 

'X is definitely feeling ABC even tho i have v limited information and i will make a snap decision based on my convoluted ideas of what might be happening even though there are many options that I haven't taken time to ask because I'm scared of the response and how it may make me feel and I'm not capable of sitting in the discomfort of not knowing and/or being fully individuated from them')

I have experienced someone else accusingly... *telling me* how I feel about something that was, quite frankly, made up. It went something like 'You think XYZ and did ABC because of it. How could you do this to me? Don't you care how I feel?' I was like 'Huh? Where on earth did you get that from? Excuse me?' It took away his credibility to me, because 1) They assumed something about me that he couldn't possibly have known without verification; 2) They did not take care to *ask* what i thought/felt about X and made up a convoluted reality about me; 3) They made a snap decision based on... a fantasy. Weird, huh? 4) They made their imagined \*stuff\* about me, about.... them; 5) Low-key emotional manipulation. (yes disclaimer not every instance is like this. Many are, though).

Where does empathy come in?

I think the difference (when it comes to comparing to mind-reading, and specifically within these subs) is *knowledge of a situation*, and *personalisation*.

Empathy reminds me of the following thoughts: being able to admit: *knowing X's circumstances, it's understandable that they may feel XYZ. I can understand and share with them, but also return to my frame of reference where I may feel something differently*. The two do not cancel each other out. Two things can be different/separate and true. I will take care to *ask* about their internal reality. In short, we are *individuated* from the other person (I believe individuation from primary care-giver is a key concept in development but anyone who's more well-read on this can maybe chime in here). We are able to not necessarily take it personally because we understand and appreciate that while we have the capacity to influence someone else's experience, it is actually *not all about us.* A respectable and anti-grandiose counter to mind-reading.

Mind-reading comes across to me as a little bit more enmeshed, because we are trying to 'figure out' someone's internal reality, their thoughts/feelings without their assistance, v often because of 'what it will mean for me' which is... a little more self-focused. *I must know what they think about this so I will be a detective and figure it out so I don't have to be vulnerable and ask them and risk them not wanting to tell me, or rejecting me. What they think* ***will*** *mean something directly about me and thus I must find out to inform me what I must do*. No. 

Prone to mind-reading? You may actually also have a great capacity for empathy then. Try: understanding what you know of their circumstances and what they *may* feel, if appropriate, ask open-ended questions about their reality, *resist the urge to make it about u* (which can be a little grandiose unless it's... directly something to actually do with you). Sit with them through it. Channel your inner Atticus Finch and try to imagine yourself in their shoes, with their circumstances. Sit in the discomfort of *returning back* to yourself after empathising with them. Notice how the difference felt for you.

*Need* to know or at least make-up how they feel so you can move on/forwards? No actually, you don't. Sure it may be helpful if they're willing to share, but if they're not, notice how it feels to sit in the discomfort of not knowing. It's okay not to know. You can still live your life and make choices/decisions about if/how something works for you without having *all* of the answers.",11uk8xf,46,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/11uk8xf/mindreading_vs_empathising_fa_da_sa_ap/,AvoidantAttachment,0
200,Connection in Modernity {fa},"I've been thinking a lot about connection in Modernity recently.

My mum tells me that when she and my dad went to university in different cities they spoke every few days via a payphone. Their connection didn't diminish despite this lack of ease in communication. I feel like the ability to constantly connect diminishes a more real (as opposed to abstract) conception of connection in regard to connection to self and connection to others. 

I'm not sure where I am going with this and maybe it is more suited to a different sub, but I''ve been pondering what this means for myself and how we all attach/connect to others around us. 

I was reading a paper about modernity and the author mentioned how, in past literature you could have a thousand page book about the development of a romance, but now this can be condensed to one tinder swipe and cast down to one or two irl meets. I found that to be really stark.

In regard to myself, I find myself falling into thought trappings related to the ability to connect 24/7 all the time. I sometimes end up wondering about what my value is if I don't hear back within expected response times. On the other hand, I don't like people constantly knowing what I am up to or expecting that I will always be available to them. If I leave messages unread it sometimes makes me feel anxious because it makes me feel like I have to respond and leaves me unable to focus on the task I am doing. 

Having the means to instantly connect has introduced variables to the relationship equation which I don't think enhances connection at all, at least not for me.",10il4u8,45,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/10il4u8/connection_in_modernity_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
201,Trajectory in relationships - figuring out when to leave or stay {FA},"I've been thinking a lot lately about all of the relationship issues that get posted. It seems a common theme among people with insecure attachment styles who are at varying levels of self awareness to have issues knowing when to stay or leave a relationship. I've been trying to figure out a way to give advice on this without necessarily relating to attachment styles. Mainly because I think when people find attachment theory it becomes this end all be all, and we can sometimes use it to justify staying longer than we should. 

In thinking about this, I tried to compare my current relationship to my past relationships that were long term but miserable. My current boyfriend couldn't commit for a long time, and avoided high conflict conversations where my ex husbands both proposed, obviously, and we were prone to have blow up fights. All of them are avoidant. My current relationship isn't something I would necessarily look at and say ""that's a happy, healthy couple"", although I do think we're on our way to that. So how do I know that this is a good fit for me, and something worth continuing to invest in? 

Trajectory. While no relationship is perfect, and I think there will always be lows and plateaus, for the most part my current relationship has had an upward trending trajectory. Looking back we are leaps and bounds more secure and healthy than we were when we started. To me this indicates that both parties are able to grow, change, and adjust to the demands of a healthy relationship. I am happier now with my boyfriend than I was when we first started dating. We have worked through so many things, each making compromises to be together. It hasn't been solely one sided the entire relationship; though we have had times where I'm putting in more effort, for the most part it has been balanced and reciprocal. We are making plans for the future together instead of me dragging him along. 

In contrast, my previous relationships were the best they ever were at the beginning, and had a downward trending trajectory. There was very little growth and compromise on their part, with me putting in a lot of the effort to keep the relationship going. There was a lack of connection and closeness that eventually led to us basically being married roommates and not true partners. 

If I had been able to look at my relationships in this way while in them, I would have been able to leave a lot sooner, I think. I would have been able to see how long it had been since there was any upward movement that lasted. 

Those of us who are insecurely attached, especially avoidants, are prone to question whether to stay in the relationship. Depending on how self aware you are, I think this may be a good tool to help you decide whether you're deactivated/triggered or truly not compatible. If we stop to ask ourselves, some probing questions to look at things objectively, it can help us move forward in whatever way is best for us. 

""What is the status of my relationship now compared to when it started?""  
""Is my relationship trajectory trending upwards or downwards?""  
""Has there been compromise, growth, and progress from both parties?"" 

And I do realized that relationships are prone to plateauing at some point, so might not always move upwards or downwards. But there's a big difference between plateauing at the sunny top of the mountain vs the dark pit of the valley.

202,{DA} How to deal with constant doubts about the relationship? I can't trust my feelings... so how can I ever know if it's time to break up?,"Losing my mind over this. I've been with my gf for 2.5 years now. It is my first relationship. Before I've always managed to push people away due to the fear of commitment, being emotionally blocked, triggered or other DA issues. 

I've been having doubts since the beginning, but she was very persistent and we ended up in a relationship. After so many failed relations on my part, I just assumed that's the way it is for me - that I'll always have to fight with doubts. I vowed to not trust my gut and not trust my doubts, to fight them and finally form a happy relationship. 

I've been to therapy, trying to process my emotions and open up. It's been a very slow progress, but some progress. The doubts are persistent and not going away though. They have maybe changed the tone? Feel less like a desire to run away and more like a calm opinion, ongoing dissatisfaction, resentment. Nevertheless, how can I ever know? Maybe it's the same thing that ruined so many of my other relationships?

208,Broke up with amazing GF and regret it after realizing it was due to my attachment style (DA),"I dated my now ex-gf for 6 months (had been great friends for 6 years prior) before breaking up with her in early November. She was incredible, our relationship was great, I was happy and we both loved each other very much.

Our relationship was going great for the first four months before I started to question everything. I started nitpicking every little thing she did, I would look for flaws that weren't there, I would pull away worrying that my freedom was being taken away and that she was holding me back from finding the one. I internally had this back and forth battle for myself for 6 weeks before I finally decided to end the relationship after it became too much.

I was so confused at the time because I was happy with her and loved her very much but for whatever reason, this feeling, which I couldn't explain, wouldn't go away. Confused, I began therapy and started to explore why I felt the way I did. As it turns out, I have an extremely avoidant attachment style and after looking back at my past relationships, I could see this same pattern with each of them.

209,Emotional Energy and Attachment Style,"I'm pretty frustrated lately with the comments I've seen about how someone's avoidant partner or ex 'doesn't ever put in any effort.' It seems to be a lack of understanding, and I've been thinking of a way to describe this. Here's what I've settled on. 

Imagine emotional energy and effort is money. Each day, everyone starts with a predetermined amount of money.

Securely attached folks get $100. They are able to budget the spending of their money well, allocating some to work, some to family, some to their partner, and still save money for themselves. They are able to recognize when something/someone is not worth spending their money on, and are more able to spend their money wisely. 

Anxiously attached folks also get $100. They readily spend money on work, family, their partner. But they rarely leave any money for themselves, frequently spending extra money on their partners in an attempt to soothe their anxiety. They are not as good at recognizing what might not be worth spending money on, and frequently over spend. 

Avoidantly attached folks have $100 as well, but they start each day by having to automatically pay $50 to the IRS (Internal Repression System). The remaining $50 they hold on tightly to. They are willing to spend it on work, family, partners, but often they will spend less because they have less - only giving $1 where a secure/anxious person might give $5. Sometimes they run out of money by the end of the day just trying to make it through, and they're left with nothing for themselves. That's where the IRS comes in and gives them what they need from their prepaid $50 to recharge for tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Imagine it's the end of the day and your avoidant partner has spent $45 of their $50. You ask for your need for connection to be met, and they give you their last $5. Compare this to a secure person who has spent $45 of their $100. If they give you $5, they still have $50 to make it through the day, and maybe meet even more of your needs. 

It may feel like your partner is not putting in any effort, but they could be giving you their last $5. It's very important to find a way to recognize the good things your partner is doing, and the ways they are putting in effort rather than focusing only on what's missing, or what they're doing wrong. 

To give an example - when my partner and I have an argument or disagreement, it sometimes leaves me feeling disconnected from my partner. In these moments, he almost always brings me a pickle - my absolute favorite snack. I could focus on the fact that he didn't give me a hug, which I would prefer to reconnect. Or I could focus on the fact that what he did was his way of reconnecting - his way of showing me that he still loves me and cares about me. 

At the end of the day, it's all about perspective, which you *absolutely* have control of. And yes, the avoidant folks could absolutely do some work to stop paying the IRS so much, allowing them more to spend on loved ones. Just as the anxious folks could learn to be more discerning with their spending and start to spend more on themselves. 

Hopefully this helps or makes sense - I'm tired and it sounded like a much better explanation in my head. Ha.",qse6sq,48,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/qse6sq/emotional_energy_and_attachment_style/,AvoidantAttachment,0
210,{DA} How to get over the fear of commitment?,"I have very minimal relationship experience at 26 years old. I've been fearful avoidant (dismissive-leaning) for almost all my life, and have avoided relationships/intimacy even when they were being handed to me on a silver platter. Only recently have I let go of my anxious side, leaving me with dismissive avoidance. 

I tend to generally be pretty emotionally open and vulnerable for a DA, as that has been something that I've worked on a lot over the years, but there's one thing I have yet to conquer which I feel is the driving force of my dismissive avoidance: fear of commitment.

I fear commitment in almost every aspect of my life, not just relationships. I tend to drop hobbies just because I feel like I don't want to be ""stuck"" doing the same thing. I have an urge to explore and see what else is out there, because life is more fun and interesting that way. As you can imagine, this fear of commitment is especially pervasive when it comes to being glued to another full-on human being. I'm a sensitive person, and I feel like my entire experience of life is warped when I'm around someone, not necessarily in a good or bad way, but everything is just different depending on who I'm with--as if there's some colored filter glasses each person places over my eyes. I don't want to be stuck with the same filter/experience forever. 

My worst fear is that I'll find someone great, everything is smooth sailing, and we go to the grave together. It paradoxically wouldn't be smooth sailing due to my avoidance, but if it *were* to be smooth sailing, that thought scares me, when it should be a vision I aspire after if I were hypothetically securely attached.

Even at a cognitive level, I have difficulty perceiving why anybody would want to spend the vast majority of their life with a single individual. I mean at some level it makes sense: you want somebody you can trust with all your heart and know that they will be there for you through and through to the very end. But I just can't internalize that desire. It's only stuff I've seen in movies or witnessed from a third-party perspective. But when it comes down to it, wouldn't life be so dull to spend so much of it with the same person? Why should I consign myself to such a fate when I'm perfectly fine on my own? I could see myself being on my own forever because I *have* been on my own forever.

As soon as the honeymoon phase at the start of a relationship fades, my eyes will be wandering elsewhere. Yes, call me novelty-seeking, a thrill-addict, that probably may very well be what I am.

The root of the issue may be that I don't know what love is. I don't know what love *feels* like. How can you desire something you don't know? You can't crave pizza if you don't know what pizza tastes like.

I'll say that I ""love"" my parents, but my heart is empty behind those words. I'm saying that just because I know I'm supposed to--it's what society, family, and friends expect of me. I feel little emotional connection to my parents and I barely call them, except when I feel like it's been longer than socially acceptable. But I mean they don't call me either. My parents are also divorced so they weren't exactly great models for love.

The only thing remaining then is my biological urge for sex, which my brain has categorized as ""love"", since it's the only love I know. That, and perhaps feelings of loneliness when all my other friends are getting into serious relationships. I guess it'd be nice to have someone keep me company on weekend evenings and fuck, but still, that's probably not what real love is.

I feel like I'm at a crossroads. Two paths lie ahead of me. On one path, I can strive to become more securely attached and learn what love is. Only then can I let go of this fear of commitment and allow myself to settle into a relationship indefinitely. On the other path, I can simply embrace avoidance, going from one ""relationship"" to the next and satisfying my sexual urges and cravings for novelty. If I were to go down that path, I would attempt to do it as ""ethically"" as possible, only looking for others who are similarly driven by avoidance and sex. But I've heard that this path usually ends up leading to long-term dissatisfaction. I'm wondering if that would be the case for me.

211,{fa} How do you accept unconditional love,"I never grew up having an idea what unconditional love is. I was given examples to interpret, from books and movies and even my friend’s dynamic with their parents. I’ve always felt that there were perimeters for love, that love can always fade with one wrong step. I’m growing to accept that things change, and are sometimes out of my control. I’m learning to feel steady and at ease, and not pain and feeling like I want to isolate myself. 

I still find myself fearing the unknown, that’ll never escape me. I’m growing feelings towards someone i’ve been seeing, who makes me feel safe. I’m constantly fighting my nervous system from freaking out and wanting to shut it all down and run. Today i’m having such a terrible time wondering if i’m even capable of accepting love, or if i’m just too damaged to hold on. I’m afraid of of all my bad parts showing over time, which will eventually drive this person away. I’m trying so hard to be in the moment, while telling myself that i’ll be OK no matter what happens.

212,{fa} Decactivation/Lovebombing,"As a fearful avoidant trying to heal whilst actively dating I’m trying to understand myself and the feelings that come up whilst also trying to be aware of red flags.

I have found I have had a series of abusive/toxic relationships with unhealed men usually with mental health/ substance abuse issues/ attachment issues..etc. It seems this is very common amongst fearful avoidants because subconsciously you know the relationship will fail.

I’m terrified of repeating mistakes and putting myself in another toxic/dangerous dynamic. With this in mind I have noticed that men tend to open up to me very, very quickly. They tell me all about the struggles and traumas they’ve had in their lives and paint themselves as the victim. They reveal very personal and deep information very quickly. In the past I would have been suckered into this false sense of intimacy but now when this happens I can feel myself deactivating. I want to run, feel anxious, feel sick and ultimately I ghost.

214,I just want to run {FA},"I think something that isn't talked about a lot is that as an FA, it's entirely possible to be activated (anxious) and deactivated (avoidant) at the same time. And it's hard to figure out which is motivating your thoughts and actions. 

My relationship is complicated, which most of you know. My boyfriend is an avoidant leaning FA. I'm an avoidant leaning FA. We have some moments of security together, but right now things are just hard. He recently got full custody of his son. I remember telling him that I was afraid when it happened that I would no longer have a place in his life. Mainly because I'm aware that he withdraws into himself when he struggles and is overwhelmed. Also because I'm well aware of how hard it is to be a full time parent with no real help, and I knew he wasn't fully prepared for what it meant. He told me he thought he would rely on my more, that it would bring us closer. Unfortunately, I was the one that was right. 

6 months ago I ended things with him because he completely withdrew from me without explanation. 4 months ago I gave him another shot because he followed through with changes. And right now I feel like we're basically back in the same place. We don't see each other. We barely talk to each other. He has told me to reach out if I need him, but when I do he ignores my texts. Logically I'm compassionate to his situation. We've talked about it, and he's told me he's felt guilt about pulling away. That he's going to try harder. That it doesn't mean his feelings have changed, he loves me and only wants to be with me. 

But I'm just left feeling like I want to run. I just want to run. 

I want to run away from the intense things I'm feeling inside. The loneliness, the fear, the powerlessness, the pain. I want to run away from all of the wounds that have been triggered. 

I want to run away from the relationship. I want to run away from feeling like I always have to be the bigger person, the secure one leading by example. I want to run away from having to work through the hard times. I want to run away from the possibility of rejection and him ending things. I want to run away from the possibility of hurting even more than I currently am. 

I want to run to any other man that can distract me and validate me in the moment. And I want to run from myself for still wanting to use that as a coping mechanism. 

I want to run from his avoidance. I want to run from my own avoidance. 

But deep down under all of the old trauma responses, I just want to run to him. I want to tell him all of these things instead of typing this post for the internet strangers of Reddit. I want to call him and tell him that I've been in tears for 2 days, I want to tell him I need him. I want to repair this together. 

But instead I'm frozen. I'm afraid to reach out. I'm afraid to be vulnerable. I'm afraid to sit with my feelings. I'm afraid to try and fix it. I'm stuck in my avoidance. I feel like any progress towards security has slipped through my fingers. I just want to pretend that none of this exists.

I think for me if I ever travel with people I join them on trips and really let myself fall into: try not control ANYTHING and just get into it with the feeling of just going along with everything and letting go of control- or traveling with people and then doing your own stuff until you meet up again at some point to do something together. I think only knowing I have the possibility to do stuff alone will make me want to spend time with someone else then. It's always like that with us avoidants isn't it? If others give us the freedom we need, we enjoy the company somehow. But we connect being with others with being controlled and being forced to do things.

218,{FA} is anybody else just completely exhausted from healing or just me?,"I have been working on my attachment wounds for the past couple of years. I was FA with a heavily anxious lean, massively codependent in relationships, completely unaware of my needs and feelings, a massive people pleaser, completely unaware of what was good for me and what wasn’t all I knew was it was too painful to be completely alone. 

Fast forward to now, I am working on my communication skills. I am in touch with my feelings and have even learned to sit with them while they pass through, I have found a new joy of being alone and am aware of my wants and needs for future relationships. 

I still find that I suffer with a lot of anxiety around making decisions. I never used to be able to decide on things properly I just used to act on impulse and give in to my triggers. 

I’m often using the mindset of ‘what would a secure person do here’ but sometimes I don’t even know the answer 😂 for example I recently ended it with someone I was briefly dating after there were a few problems and now I am questioning did I end it from a place of being secure enough to walk away or would a secure person have worked through the issue?

It is so alien to me to be in a place where I’m feeling things and being vulnerable in ways I never could before, not just in romantic relationships but friendships too.

220,Time moves differently for me {da},"In a romantic relationship, I take 6 months as a bare minimum to feel emotionally safe around someone. Even that feels kinda short, as I type it out. It's usually a full year before I can say I love someone. But when I do, I really mean it! 

To me (and other DA's maybe?) it looks absolutely bananas to see people forming what I see as ""instant friendships"" or instantly fully attached relationships. It doesn't compute that others can just ... trust each other in a couple months -- or even weeks!? 

It just seems so inhumanly, bafflingly, dangerously fast!

I see a lot of posts here about a DA being unresponsive or not giving enough, and then I see that the relationship has only been going on for 4 or 6 months. Like -- dude, this might feel like a week to them, emotionally. They have to process this to make sure it's safe. I want to scream: They don't hate you! Please give them time! (More time than you could ever possibly conceive a person could need! Stay patient and the rewards will be great!)

Sometimes it feels alienating, like I was born with a bizzarely warped sense of time when it comes to interpersonal relationships. 

""We haven't talked in a month!"" -- distraught, anxious friend.

""Correct."" -- me, for whom this doesn't feel weird in the least. And now I'm having an anxiety moment thinking I've hurt their feelings by doing absolutely nothing. Sittin' here, eatin' Cheetos, believing we were really good friends. Fuck me, right?

222,Avoidance and Parenting,"\*\*\*\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

This is a topic I so wish was discussed more. Hopefully this will kick start a good discussion.

I've spent my entire life struggling to connect with people. Logically, I know I love my mom and my sister, but emotionally I don't always feel it. I thought I was feeling love with romantic partners, but I'm not sure that's accurate either - I was definitely attached (insecurely) and trauma bonded to all of them but the last, and even maybe him to an extent.

I have 4 kids. Boy, girl, boy, boy. I was super close to my oldest for a long time. We spent a lot of his early years just him and me. It was hard. I was only 18 when I had him, was planning on giving him up for adoption (it fell through in the hospital for legal reasons), and I didn't have a real life example of what a good parent was to work from.

When my daughter came around, I don't know that I ever really felt attached to her at all. I had zero desire to have a daughter, and I remember crying at the ultrasound. Her dad and I weren't getting along the greatest at the time of her birth - shortly before he made the decision to quit a full ride scholarship with 1 semester to go to get his degree and starting working from home. He was her primary caregiver from the time I went back to work, and I let them bond because I didn't feel it.

And I absolutely adored my youngest two. My 5 year old was like an only child because his older siblings were with their dad 50/50, so he also got a lot of my time/attention. My youngest was a rainbow baby, and he's currently the only child I feel a connection with.

I've been acutely aware for years that at some point, my kids reach an age where I don't feel love for them actively anymore. I was able to figure out that it's usually around the age they become more independent, have more of their own personality, and rely less on parents. Before learning about attachment theory, I didn't realize that I was avoidantly attached to them. I only knew that something was wrong with me.

There has been a lot of shame and guilt that I place on myself, because I love my kids, but I just don't feel connected to them. I struggle to imagine how I would feel if they were seriously sick or injured, or god forbid died. I'm not sure I would be able to tap into any emotion right away. And that just adds more shame and guilt. I am awesome at providing them their basic needs. I am awesome at being an advocate for them (one has ADHD, one has depression). But I would also be completely content to not see them anymore. Which is fucked up.

My therapist and I decided a couple of weeks ago to discuss parenting. That was derailed by the recent break up, but we managed to start on the topic yesterday. As I was explaining my feelings, I expressed that I didn't feel a strong sense of self identity, and that made it hard to have direction with my kids. I also expressed that I'm very reactionary and tend to yell - a lot. ""I feel like I'm a kid trying to raise kids.""

Up until that point, I had managed not to cry (and that includes through a brief catch up of the ex drama). But I immediately felt a wound being triggered and even said ""Wow, that hit something."" He asked what it hit. And I knew. I've always known, I suppose. I think I was probably around 4-6 when I started to be aware that my parents didn't love me the way I needed them too. When I realized that I was missing something from them that I desperately needed. And that's about the age that I stop being able to connect with my kids. I don't know how to love them beyond the age that I felt loved.

Even now typing this up it's hitting me really hard. Generational trauma is such bullshit. I know I'm a better parent than my parents were, but that doesn't mean I'm a good parent. My kids are one day going to be adults who are dealing with core wounds that I helped give them, and I hate that. I hate that I couldn't be the parent I needed. I hate that I'm not more better than my parents were. My therapist gave me some homework and tools to use to help keep me calm. I'm going to implement them, and he assured me that it's not too late to make a difference.

I wonder if there are other avoidant parents out there and how you feel in the role of parent. What feelings come up for you? What do you do really well? What do you wish you could do differently?

223,How do you distinguish between neediness and emotional manipulation?,"So I recently read that a hallmark of toxic people is they interpret ""everything"" as a sign someone is trying to control them. Yep, that's me (although I don't usually express it outwardly).

It helped me define a question I've been wondering about for a long time. How can you tell if someone's neediness is normal/healthy, or a sign they *are* trying to control you?

It seems like feeling guilty for not being able to make someone happy, to some extent, is just a normal consequence of the situation. Expressing sadness and disappointment that your needs aren't being met is also a healthy behavior, not inherently manipulative. But playing on someone's guilt and obligation (to reciprocate, appease, follow social norms, etc.) is also what a person who is trying to control, manipulate or emotionally blackmail would do?

I have a BIG problem with feeling like I'm being used as a validation vending machine. People coming across like: if they do/say X, they should get Y back, or else I'm just a bad person or a big disappointment. A broken machine. I fear if I give them Y ""on demand"" they'll just keep coming back to ""demand"" more and more. It makes me irrationally upset and I want to fix it, but I don't know how to navigate where the lines are.",snk6i8,46,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/snk6i8/how_do_you_distinguish_between_neediness_and/,AvoidantAttachment,0
224,"Trust your intuition, not your instincts","Reminder to my avoidants to pay attention to what your intuition is telling you as its likely different from your avoidant instincts.

Anecdotally, avoidants (more so DAs) connect with far fewer people since we lack creating instinctual relationship ""glue"" due to lack of desire.

If your intuition is telling you you're not into a person (no matter the type of relationship) and your desire/curiosity is not telling you you're willing to invest more, listen to it. Its probably different from your avoidant instincts. If you're pulling away from someone you're already invested in, stop and see if you can get in touch with your intuition. If not, evaluate the situation, give yourself time to process, wait to see if you can start getting signals from within.

I know its not that simple, especially if you're in a situation in which you've become attached to someone and your intuition is telling you to leave.

225,2 months later and I can’t kick the ick. Any pointers?,"My long distance long term girlfriend and I (32m){FA} got in a big argument about 2 months ago and it really shook me. My FA makes me extra careful with the things I say and very nervous about upsetting my partner, so things are sometimes not immediately resolved or I later feel like I wasn’t able to properly communicate my feelings. We always end up resolving the argument later though. Since this particular argument happened, we have made multiple attempts at settling things and making up and I just haven’t been able to get past my negative feelings. I’ve been doing my best to communicate these feelings with them honestly without being harsh but honestly I’m also not feeling as safe to be vulnerable as I once did in this relationship which I’m also hoping to repair. So I’ve been doing some of this work by myself. 

Some things I’ve been doing to try to combat these feelings: 
-positive affirmations, doing my best to not project my poor self-image on her
-expressing gratitude
-challenging the critical inner voice
-sitting in my feelings and allowing them to happen, then approaching with compassionate curiosity
-read Running on Empty and Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents and fill out worksheets 

What helps you snap out of it? Anybody gone from having complete doom and gloom feelings in a relationship to happy recovery? I feel like ending the relationship would just be me giving up like I always have but at the same time like my feelings might not be just another deactivation episode. And still the risk of throwing it all away for an episode I could’ve worked through scares me.

228,{FA} After having a good time with people I always feel awful and angry,"I recently learned about attachment theory, and a lot of things suddenly make sense. One of those things is that after I have a good time with friends, I always feel shitty the next day. Like I feel angry and like my brain is picking apart every interaction, trying to find something to be mad about, even if it's something as petty as someone interrupting me while I was talking. I guess, in a way, I feel...unsafe? Like I've exposed some part of myself, and I'm in danger somehow. I end up isolating myself for days, not talking to anyone, trying to feel ""safe"" again by being alone and doing things on my own to prove to my brain that everything is fine.  


It really sucks because, for a while, I thought maybe I was an introvert and that the period after being with people was just me trying to get my social battery back, but as I got older, I realized that being around friends and meeting interesting new people actually makes me happy. But the happiness triggers some part of me that makes me feel unsafe, like because I'm happy, I'll be hurt somehow, in some way or another.

229,{fa} I don't think I'll ever be able to fully experience love,"Hi. I'm really sorry if this post comes off as extremely negative, please don't read it if you're sensitive to self hatred or similar stuff.

I just recently found out I'm a Fearful Avoidant. It was honestly quite the shocker, and right now even I'm still trying to cope with it. You see, I'm 19 years old, and I've always desired to be loved. Never once in my life have I had a romantic relationship. I have, however, fallen in love. And this is just what confuses me the most, because I remember so vividly just *feeling*, yk? Like I genuinely felt my chest pounding and all that stuff.

Ever since then, however, things just have never been the same. You see, I've always had self esteem issues, and suffer depression ever since being a kid basically, but somehow I've often still considered myself a bit worthy of being in a relationship. 

And I have met people who I like, who make me feel shy with my cheeks all blushed, but it was never *reciprocal*, and I think that's the key to all the turmoil that I'm going through right now. 

All of a sudden, and really, all of a sudden, a lot of people started to show interest in me. And fucked up stuff started to happen. When they told me sweet things, I could feel my insides burning and my head wanting to explode. Like, I felt such a need to run away and throw myself onto a highway. I really don't know how to explain it, it felt like an itch as if my skin suddenly became poisonous. 

And this just kept happening over and over again, and the worst part is that I'd even encourage such behaviour from the other parts. For example, if we were talking through the phone in texts, then even I would *sometimes* feel a bit nervous and even daydream of being in a relationship, but whenever I met said person my body would just shut down, as if I had become a mannequin. Everything I did and say became mechanical and I would say sweet things back when in reality all I wanted was to puke and hide. 

Whenever this happened I would tell to myself ""It's okay, I just like them more as friends"" but then the girl who I thought I liked told me she loved me. 

Man, even thinking about it now, makes me want to cry and puke at the same time. 

She told me she loved me and instead of being happy I just felt empty. This had never happened to me before. Was just so disconnected from my feelings, they really just vanished. The literal second I knew it was mutual, my heart decided to stab himself. I told her ""hey, I love you too"" because I thought it would pass, like a fever, but it never did. When I got home my whole body was just so weak and everything felt so uncomfortable I just wanted to destroy myself. Felt so shitty for feeling the way I felt. So guilty. 

In the end I came clean with her and told her everything, and that I couldn't be in a relationship with her. Here's the funny thing: when she said she hated me, I felt so happy. All I wanted was for her to get away from me, to forget my name and face, and I got that. Like give me a reason I can run away. 

Right now, I'm in a relationship with someone. This was after seeing a therapist because I was just a self destructive mess. I do like being with this person, but only when we are talking by text because when I see her in person my chest forgets what emotion is all over again. I can only act when badly alcoholized, and even then, everything is still forced. 

I just feel awful, I really want to d*e. I'm such an awful person, because what I'm doing is selfish. I genuinely thought things would be better now that I now what the problem is and that my partner is Secure and all, but I feel even worst. Now I can't even stand the texts, but at nights I will sometimes think of kissing her. It's all so confusing and tiring, so extremely tiring, I don't think I can do this for the rest of my life. I think I'm better off just avoiding any type of romantic relationships.

230,{DA} how do you all tap into empathy toward others when you're overwhelmed,"hi all, hope everything's going well. i'm tagged as secure but was recently triggered by something and am kind of backsliding into some dismissive habits i have. as examples: i feel excessively annoyed at my roommate for her messiness, i'm not responding to texts from family, and i'm annoyed at a friend for flaking on plans but in a way that i feel is disproportionate). i think the DA tendencies in me, when triggered badly, tends to go through this thought process of, ""well, my support system always disappoints me, i'm better off dealing with this myself"" while looking totally calm on the outside. i was recently in a close friendship with an unaware DA where i was essentially left on my own for any sort of verbal or emotional reassurance, and i think i may have over-internalized that message.

anyway, i'm wondering how you guys rejoin society after being triggered, because i definitely have felt overwhelmed recently. i tend to build unhealthy resentment toward others when i feel disappointed. i'm normally pretty good about being an earned SA (i've learned to voice my needs instead of expecting others to guess them, i see a therapist regularly, i hold myself accountable when i hurt others and reach out to acknowledge my fault, etc), but a few years of therapy don't undo lifelong wiring of thinking i'm on my own. like i know this is so DA but sometimes i honestly feel like i'm the only person in my life with any sort of common sense 

TLDR how do you all self-soothe when you feel really disappointed by others, i can feel myself backsliding and would appreciate any advice or gentle words others have toward resisting resentment",11d4xbw,43,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/11d4xbw/da_how_do_you_all_tap_into_empathy_toward_others/,AvoidantAttachment,0

However, it has also been very painful. Past relationships and mistakes that I would just attribute to life I know were entirely caused by me. I know now that I just haven’t been a good person.

All I want to do now is go back and correct past mistakes even though it’s impossible. 

I really wish I had learnt about this earlier and could have avoided behaving the way that I did. I was just listening to my “gut” at the time but that couldn’t be more wrong.

233,Leaving people on read in justified avoidance,"As an earned secure-leaning person, I wanna talk about communication and when I find myself leaving people on read in justified avoidance.

I'll be honest, I do this semi-regularly at this point. There are about 5 individuals who I've known for several–6+ months. These are all people who are interested in me romantically but I've informed them several times that I am not dating. None of these people have gotten the chance to meet me more than 3 times. Most have only met me in person once.

Every so often, these individuals will attempt to reconnect with me and propose getting together. I say no thanks, not interested. They will generally try to dive in more and ""figure out"" how to see each other again. Sometime around this point, I find it acceptable for me to leave them on read and I don't feel bad about it.

Why? Last year when I was still completely DA and figuring things out, I practiced what I call now ""over-communicating"". It lead me down some pretty bad conversations with people because I didn't manage to find a way to explain why I was unavailable without hurting their feelings. 

Now I say: stop there. This was not helpful for my conflict avoidance and why can't an individual respect my clear ""no thanks"".

I now see that scenario as me having poor boundaries or letting myself get strung into a dynamic that I clearly said I didn't want.

""Sorry, I'm not interested""

""I'm not dating at the moment""

""No thank you""

This should be enough. Another person (especially one I'm not bonded with) is not entitled to further explanation from me and the same is true for you and your relationships.

234,Other reasons besides parents for avoidant behavior {DA},"I know that your early experiences with your parents can affect attachment style, but this is not always the reason behind avoidant attachment. Some of us came from loving caring households and still developed avoidant styles.

What have people here discovered about what may be causing your attachment issues, other than early childhood? 

For me, I think it might have to do with a social inferiority complex I developed in my early teens. I felt unattractive, and never had someone desirable like me. Now when someone expresses romantic affection to me, I deactivate (sometimes). I think this is because my subconscious says “if she loves you, she must be undesirable, because the people you want don’t want you back”. 

It’s a theory, and it needs more testing, but it makes WAY more sense to me than trying to find trauma in my relatively happy childhood.

235,Don’t feel like “myself” when I’m first dating someone.,"I feel like part of the reason why I (28F) avoid relationships is that I have a hard time feeling like “myself” with a new guy. Sometimes I will actually really like a guy but the strain of having to be “on” every time I’m with him in the beginning is draining and I need to preserve my alone time or time in comfortable spaces. Even if I enjoy a date I feel a sense of relief when I can leave and be back in my comfort zone.

I typically have been able to make friends easily and don’t necessarily feel this anxiety around spending time with friends? Maybe because it’s a low stakes environment.

I feel like this tendency has been a large driver in preventing me from getting to that next level and into something more seriously.

237,How to not emotionally detach from a partner when we have to be physically/emotionally distant?,"My partner (22NB) and I (20F) have been dating for nearly 2 years. We've been through ups and downs, and used to have a very unhealthy relationship until a year ago. We've discovered a lot about ourselves and what we want from a relationship and I'd say we are doing much better as partners. 

However, they are on vacation for a couple of days and not going to be around for 10 more days. We talk once or twice a day, and while this does not bother me (I've made huge improvements!) we are obviously physically, and kind of emotionally distant. I generally like chatting and FaceTiming throughout the day, so not doing the things that emotionally bound me to a partner makes me feel emotionally distant from them. However, whenever I feel emotionally distant, which I don't think is bad or unhealthy in a relationship, I feel emotionally detached. What I mean by that is I'm not as eager to talk with them as I was before, and I feel like I don't have a ""partner"" right now if it makes sense? Not that I feel alone, it's just that the feelings I have towards this relationship has changed a lot just because we have been emotionally distant, therefore I am emotionally detached. This bothers me because being emotionally detached from my partner generally has a long-lasting effect, and I need time to rebuild our bond, which could affect our relationship and our bonding I'm afraid.

242,"{FA} Musings on what non-transactional love is when you've never seen it, or can't recognize it.","I'm getting somewhere in healing the mess left behind by one or more very damaging relationships throughout my life, but not sure how to move forward. Maybe someone in here would want to share their perspective?

I think I'm able to recognize the fear behind my avoidance is due to an aversion to the notion of being liked or loved **for specific reasons** e.g. *what I can do* for someone/*what role I can fill* in their life, versus aligning and connecting with someone on a deeper level. I think I fear transactional relationships, but those are 100% of my relationships, including parents, so I have a bad foundation.

The main question I keep asking myself is telling... ""*why* would anyone love me?"" and that never sat quite right, because it misses a huge point.

I think healthy people avoid getting entangled with people who have agendas, or just people who have issues... like wondering if they have any attractive *things* about them, or *things they do* which are ""worth it""!

I'm not sure, because I don't think I'd recognize if someone healthy fell for *me*. I can't tell if that ever happened, I assume not and there's probably a lot of explanations for that--I'm pretty unhealthy still, although I'm no longer as hurtful as I was when I was less informed and more inexperienced.

I'm not sure if I have any examples of healthy love around me at the moment. I think I see a few couples staying together for apparently no reason (childfree couples who just seem to go well together), but in a few I can detect an air of boredom, or just plain habit without resentment, or just some contented settling... the knowledge that if you'd have to start over, you probably wouldn't find anyone, but your partner is ""good enough"" (blegh!)

Thing is, I have no idea what non-transactional love looks like--I've absolutely never experienced this. I have had **no** relationships where there weren't 1+ *reasons* for having been loved, which today I think never was ""love"" at all.

Or if it was, I'm at least healthy enough to say: I don't want that brand. I've healed to the point where I know that not all love is awesome and great. I want a specific kind, or I'll pass, and I can see places to go in my life alone that would make that option worth it.

I'm worried this love doesn't actually exist though, and I might be missing a bland reality that every non-fictionalized, non-romanticized relationship out there **is** built on ""reasons"", at least maybe at the start.

Am I actually seeing it this way because it's the way love can be, or did I fall for cheap stories at some point and I'm replacing a bad model with a potentially equally bad one?",y7puzt,43,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/y7puzt/fa_musings_on_what_nontransactional_love_is_when/,AvoidantAttachment,0
243,{FA} Distance induced deactivation- what's the trigger?,"Hey! This has been echoed a lot, but I knew for ages that I tend to think worse of people and get ideas about cutting them off when I don't see them for a while (and also if I see them too frequently). It's like the stuff that doesn't bother me face-to-face suddenly feels unbearable and I can't motivate myself to see them anymore.

I mentioned this to my therapist and (in different phrasing) she basically said there must be a trigger for this and tried to get me to think of what those triggers are, but I'm drawing a blank. Is it some weird manifestation of separation anxiety? Is it that I don't draw boundaries around these things that annoy me face-to-face (and maybe it feels fine because I'm detached) and that grows resentment? Is it that I feel like they have abandoned me and I'm doing uno reverse? Is there a more specific trigger? I don't know.

245,Should I be able to attach in an unhealthy relationship? {FA} {DA},"I recently ended a relationship that has become very unhealthy (partner and I had conflicting needs and this resulted in frequent difficult conversations that seemed like they didn't resolve anything). Neither of us were meeting the other's needs. 

I became extremely frustrated at myself for not feeling more in the relationship and I took this as evidence that I was heartless and incapable of love due to my attachment style. However, friend after friend and finally my therapist expressed that I shouldn't pressure myself to feel deeply emotionally engaged in a relationship that just isn't good.

I think that because my partner felt very deeply for me, and because I've seen many other people feel very deeply attached in unhealthy relationships, I have felt like I'm ""supposed to"" feel deeply attached to my partner even though our relationship was causing me so much exhaustion and discomfort. 

What I've realized is that my emotional deactivation is something I developed to protect myself. I don't want to deactivate in healthy relationships, but it probably isn't a bad thing when I deactivate in unhealthy relationships.

Since the breakup, I've realized that I am attracted to my ex, that I do still love him, that I do miss him, that I do care about him deeply. All of those human things I accused myself of not being able to feel. But when we were together and he wasn't taking good care of me, I couldn't develop a deep sense of connection or a desire for vulnerability. Why? Because my nervous system knew it wasn't safe.

So this is your reminder: do your own attachment work! But please, recognize your partner's responsibility to meet you halfway by being healthy.

246,This is why we avoid. {DA},"I took the day off work today. I’ve been in a bit of a bad spiral since last afternoon, feeling more and more shitty. This morning I got so upset I cried in bed, then I cried in the shower, then I cried on the edge of the mattress while putting my socks on to leave. I eventually gave up, told my boss I wasn’t feeling well and chose to stay home. (I’m VERY grateful to have a workplace that’s super flexible).

Many of us here are fed up with the dating process, that’s not new. I’ve made a change in my strategy though— I’m actively trying to set up dates even if I’m not super feeling the guy up front. As they say, you don’t know how the chemistry will be in person. I’ve switched from my old avoidant strategy of never trying, to giving it a shot. I really figured it would make a difference. 

So imagine my surprise when I still can’t land a single date. Even the guys who ask me first first bail when I tell them my schedule (edit: as in “I’m free Tuesday-Thursday nights for a date, that sort of thing) much less the guys *i* ask first. And then when I mention offhandedly on Reddit that I’m having trouble getting dates, I get blamed and insinuated that it’s because I’m not actually good looking enough, or I have some other deep flaw. I have no reason to believe the looks are the issue (I’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback in this respect— I think any more elaboration on that would be annoying). I’ve had lots of guys tell me that “I could get any man I want”, (usually said by guys who are involved with me and actually will never man up and date me so actually uhh no I can’t lol), and overall I believe myself and have been reassured to be a catch. So what the hell gives? I can’t get one date? Not one? Like yes sure, I could get a date if I allow in guys who are extremely red Flaggy and obviously abusive or toxic or whatever, but adjusting for that. I don’t demand six figures or washboard abs or whatever. I like artsy nerdy weirdos with dark hair. 

I guess I’m grappling with is this strange feeling of being told I’m fairly desirable on one end, and being shown I’m not on the other. And if I were just passively swiping on tinder and not actively trying to get dates, I wouldn’t have to face it. 

This is what we’re avoiding. The pain of trying and failing shows us to the parts of ourselves that feel flawed and defective, and in a lot of ways it hurts so much more than never trying at all. I know they mean it in a nice/flirtatious way, but whenever a guy asks me in disbelief how I’m single, it feels like a knife. And then when I agree to meet for dinner, he bails anyway. 

But I can’t be avoidant forever, so I guess I’m going to keep trying, failing, and wondering what it is about me that’s scaring men off. Being alone hurts too. I really don’t know why I’m not good enough.",tb9k4v,40,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tb9k4v/this_is_why_we_avoid_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
247,Describe your ideal romantic partnership,"
I’m dating a great guy. 

It’s been working well for 2.5 years. 

Mutuality and interdependence have not developed.  He does not appear to be interested in those things. 

I’m very clear that he is someone I want in my life long term. He’s super great exactly the way he is and I’m not interested in pushing his boundaries or trying to get him to change. 

As I ponder possible reconfigurations of our relationship that allow me to get what I need while not asking him to give more than he feels capable of giving, I thought it might be helpful to get some inspiration on what that could look like. 

We’ve done a lot already that I’m proud of, such as:

- A code word for when one of us needs space Right Now. 
- Uncapped alone time, no questions asked, just let the other one know when you’ll be checking in next. 
- Conversational consent (is now an okay time to talk about X?)
-  prohibition on emotional dumping

250,{FA} Over romanticization and intensity.,"I need some advice and support… I have felt apathy for a long time in my life, most of my life if not for all, the way I used to call it was “Not feeling alive/needing to feel alive” - I am reading a book that explained apathy and resonates with me big time.

I am already working with my therapist in not romanticizing every “shiny thing I see and think I need or want”, but when my  emotional energy it’s place in a object (person) it’s very hard to redirect because this said person made me feel something, made me feel alive… it’s like I am lying to myself that I can feel something, by overindulging and I believe my own lies and pressure myself to jump into it, the emotion and intensively of it. 
I think it’s my system wanting to get “high” and not allowing myself to get close slowly, because I am scared! 

I feel very delusional to be honest because I am the person that brings intensity to the table and have always been, but I think in a unconsciously way that the person is the one who made me feel that way, and that I don’t deserve to be taken into consideration or even connect in a deeper way, it’s like I have a block and thousands of walls and I allow anyone to come in, but I don’t allow myself to get out! l’ve build a internal prison to pretty to leave… 

I don’t create rapport I create ideas of what could and should be, I create painful stories so I can write about them (I like writing poetry) it’s like self inflicted pain, it is not always limerence, it’s hard to explain, I don’t know how to stop it, I hope I am not alone in this… I think most of it has to do with deep fear and control, I feel a little lost! 

Is anyone going through this?

251,I’ve never been in a loving relationship {FA},"I (27F) have never been in a relationship where me and my partner were both in love with each other. 

I’ve had a few guys say they love me. But this was typically very early in dating and so I don’t think genuine anyway because they didn’t even really know me. I definitely didn’t feel it back. 

I have been in one proper relationship for a year. I would say I loved him (but never told him). He didn’t love me and he wanted a lot of distance in the relationship so it never felt that serious. 

Then most of the rest of the people I’ve been involved with, it’s been pretty casual and love hasn’t developed on either side. 

I know part of this is that I tend to seek out casual non-exclusive connections. And that I tend to be turned off by people who are more into me, so I tend to cut those connections off early on. 

But I can’t help but feel like there’s something wrong with me. I’ve never been properly loved by anyone. And never properly been in love with anyone. I can’t relate to how most people feel in relationships or being really close with and spending lots of time with a partner. I’ve never spent more than three consecutive days with a partner. 

I feel like I must be unloveable in some way. I’m the type of person people tend to be happy to see once every week or two, but who they never want anything more with. And I don’t exactly know why. Idk I just feel a bit crap about it recently. 

I have lots of really close friends. I am really close with my sister. I like a lot about myself. I think I have a lot going for me. But it seems like there’s just something that doesn’t work romantically for me. 

Interested to hear anyone’s thoughts or to hear about whether anyone else feels similarly.",yka8s1,41,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/yka8s1/ive_never_been_in_a_loving_relationship_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
252,{DA} How comes I go suddenly cold after intense feelings? How to work on that before it happens?,"During all my life I had the same issues with partners: I wasn't into them romantically, and after a while I'd just ""disengage"" in a not recoverable way, going worse and worse without looking back (ever). However, I can pinpoint some reasons for that, specific for them or for how things were, in general, not just ""fear of committment"" (although this is for sure a big thing, as soon as I feel expectations I run away, and just getting objective good reasons to detach is like pristine fuel to get excuses to not commit).  
Because of this ""not looking back"" I think I'm DA.  
Now, after many years I stopped dating at all considering it was always going the same, I'm dating (online, from months - gonna meet next month) a person who is simply fantastic and doesn't have a number of issues I got with all of my exes, and truly an amazing match in compatibility under a surprisingly high number of things. This person makes my brain go continuously in ""yes this person is amazing BUT"", and tries to find ""buts"" at every cost, even if it's really really hard to find any valid one, this time, so the brain stays in idle.I do feel romantically involved and ready to be emotionally vulnerable, accessible fully, which is a news in my life and I'm excited about that. We had also phone intimacy and it was so intense, wow.Some days ago I declared I feel like going past a threshold of feelings I can't come back from, something very deep that could be similar to love. I was strongly into this person, with a long term vision.  
Yesterday I woke up and I feel incredibly cold, I perceive this person like a friend-only (good friend still, but just a friend), I can't ""believe"" all the romance I felt in the previous days instead, like if it was a movie or a dream. If I imagine kissing or intimacy, I feel either nothing. I'm so frustrated about this.  
This person is fully aware of how I ""work"", is aware of what I'm having now because I invested a lot in transparency and communication, is okay with that, is extremely patient, never clingy, never needy, never boring, keeps a real autonomy and our friendship underneath is very solid, our mutual trust is huge. But I'm anyway frustrated about these sudden detachments I have, intermittent feelings, with no real reason behind I can pinpoint at all. Nothing really happened that could justify going so extremely cold all of a sudden. I don't get it. And I had intermittent feelings since the beginning anyway, just now the difference is more striking...

Should I worry? Should my partner worry? How do I prevent this? What could my partner do, actively, to increase the chances I will commit in a stable way? This person is the best pick I can imagine of, I don't want to fail it this time and to not be able to recover feelings anymore after my brain decides it's time to start disengaging forever. And this person is very willing to cooperate with my issue, blessed... I'm also scared about getting cold and dismissive when meeting in real life with no way to fix it...",xj6ed0,40,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/xj6ed0/da_how_comes_i_go_suddenly_cold_after_intense/,AvoidantAttachment,0
253,"{DA} {FA?} Feeling dismissed, unheard, silenced by the anxiety of an AP partner","TLDR : Have you ever felt dismissed, unheard, silenced by the anxiety of an AP partner ?

&#x200B;

I don't want to look like I'm taking the victim stance, but I suffered a lot during my last 2 years relationship with an AP partner, and I'm curious if anyone experienced the same things as I did.

During this relationship, EVERY SINGLE TIME I'd try to raise something that was bothering/troubling me, it would get her (my ex) to full anxiety mode and I'd have to go out of my way to reassure her and soothe her anxiety. I'd have to put what was initially bothering/troubling me aside. She would usually start crying and say thing such as:

\- ""You're not happy with me""

\- ""You hate me""

\- ""You're gonna leave me""

\- ""I can't make you happy""

It could happen at anytime, even about subjects that have nothing to do with the relationship, and sometimes even about subjects that were not even ""negative"" per se. I'm not even talking about questionning the relationship or anything like that. I can't imagine what such subjects would have triggered in her. Her reaction to even  benign subjects was ofter frightening enough for me not to engage in such discussions.

For the first year and a half, in these moments, I took it upon myself to reassure her, and learned to put aside my need to communicate my hardships. As a people-pleasing DA, it felt tolerable in the beginning. But as it kept happening over and over again, I felt more and more unheard, silenced. I felt like I was walking on eggshells 24/7 and that anything I'd say could trigger her. I grew resentful and ultimately stopped saying anything ""non-positive"" or below surface level.

&#x200B;

Can anyone relate to this ? I am really curious to hear other's stories.",xiekel,40,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/xiekel/da_fa_feeling_dismissed_unheard_silenced_by_the/,AvoidantAttachment,0
254,{da} what attracted you to an anxious partner?,"Hey all. Recently been reflecting on a past relationship with an anxious partner that ended a few months ago. In particular, I've been trying to figure out what it is that drew me to them in the first place. 

I keep coming back to the fact that my anxious ex was the first person in my life that I felt seen by. That made it easy to (superficially) open up to them and have our lives integrated into one another's. Of course, in their mind, they were building an idealized, pedestalled version of myself that I could never live up to. And I think I started to abandon my imperfect, authentic self so I could try to embody their version of me. I also became really close with their family, which made me feel a sense of belonging that I hadn't felt from my own family. 

With that being said what do you guys think attracted you to previous/current anxious partners?",wqt24m,40,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wqt24m/da_what_attracted_you_to_an_anxious_partner/,AvoidantAttachment,0
255,A happy post {FA},"I mostly post describing tricky situations and observing internal struggles.

I wanted to make a post here because I've been very calm, deeply happy, and connected to gratitude the last few days.

Before this, I was kind of [stuck in a hyper-vigilance mode and wanting to hide myself away](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vxfjq5/hypervigilance_and_selfremoval_fa/). I just moved in with my partner last week and I think it was some initial emotional tremors. But then we got in a fight, and weathered that fight really well on both sides. We both really impressed me honestly, and seeing my partner overcome some things I wasn't even sure they were aware of felt healing and gave me a lot of confidence going forward.

But ok like I was saying, the last few days I've just been... happy. 

I've feel connected to my partner and myself at the same time. I feel free and autonomous and also connected and beholden in a good way.  I've felt secure, and actually full of real hope about our future together and as individuals—feeling in my body *for the first time in seriously about a decade* that I'm actually where I want to be, and heading where I want to go, kind of on all fronts. Toward a career I could not possibly be more excited about or invested in. Towards stability in general and potentially home ownership. Towards marriage and family with someone I have no doubts about. Everything I've always wanted for myself.

I even got overwhelmed by it yesterday, and felt this urge to just place my hand over my heart and breathe with the immense gratitude I'm swimming in (and I did, and got teary eyed, and I felt immersed in that feeling for probably 30 entire minutes.) This journey through dealing with the underpinnings of my avoidance, repairing this ruptured and damaged relationship, and getting to this place has been by far the most painful yet meaningful period of my entire life. But I made it through, and to be honest I'm proud of myself. I faced a lot of really hard things, and dispelled a lot of really sticky delusions. I didn't know I was entering into this kind of things at the outset or even throughout a lot of it, but now I can see that this will be a gigantic ""before"" and ""after"" hinge moment in my lifetime. I am different than I was before this past year. In many ways it feels less like I've built this new person from scratch and more like I've merely recovered things long buried. I'm a total sap now, I know.

In hindsight, it's so easy to see the ways I kept myself from ever getting here—but it was impossible to see then. It always felt like it was circumstantial, dependent on others, etc. It wasn't. I had the power the entire time to make choices to create the life I want, and I finally did.

Just wanted to share. I hope this comes off as just an earnest desire to share my experience, and to inspire anyone who feels stuck to keep going—and not as a heedless brag, haha. I'm a also aware that it's very unlikely I'll never experience some avoidance again, I pretty much know I will. But with all I've learned I truly do not think it will wreck my life anymore. It may cause some conflict, and confusion... but I don't see it taking the wheel entirely.",w24c75,40,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/w24c75/a_happy_post_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
256,"avoidant attachment and ""scarcity"" {FA}","Recently in this sub someone referred to the idea that an element of ""scarcity"" makes them more emotionally invested.

258,Deactivating because life is hard {FA},"I had this realization this morning that I tend to deactivate when I'm stressed out by life in general. I've been overwhelmed by moving with very little help. I'm a single mom to 3 boys who never spend time with their dads. They're all difficult in their own way and most likely neurodivergent, which can compete with my own. I'm at a place of hating my work life again (which ebbs and flows). 

Moving entails it's own stressors. Packing, actually moving, setting everything up in the new house, cleaning the old house, updating paperwork everywhere, enrolling in new schools, etc. The list goes on. 

I'm finding that the more stressed I get by life events, the more my relationship wears on me. The more time I need alone. The more I nitpick and find things wrong with my partner. The more I think about ending things and just being alone. Small things that can easily be worked through become big things that I don't feel like dealing with. 

I realized that the reason is because the relationship is optional. I don't have a choice by to move and do everything involved. I don't have a choice but to parent and take care of my kids. I don't have a choice but to work. All of those things are necessary, and even if they're stressing me out I have to push through. But my relationship is not necessary. My relationship is the only thing I can somewhat control because it's not necessary. And I hate it. 

I hate knowing that I love this person, and I want to be with them yet I'm thinking ""Everything would be better if I ended it."" I hate knowing that's not even what I want, but that I'm able to justify this thought easily. I hate feeling so secure in the relationship, but then wanting to run because my life is overwhelming. I hate that I try to keep everything internally because I know it's my irrational avoidance, but that my boyfriend can feel that something is off.

259,Expressing emotions vs intellectualising them {FA} {DA},"There’s a lot of intellectualising of experiences here (obviously - it’s the nature of the forum).

This certainly has an important place for understanding patterning, however I also think we can understate the value of expressing our emotions rather than just intellectualising.

I’ve realised that intellectualising myself was sometimes a further way of avoiding fully feeling my feelings (I didn’t have to feel them, because I was *thinking* them and intellectualising them. They will not necessarily go away if we *just* do this). How very meta!

Life isn’t always there to be ‘solved’ - it’s there to be experienced. If you ever find yourself stuck, try expressing feelings instead of dissolving them via intellectualisation. Dance, art, poetry, making music. It’s the difference of ‘solving feelings’ vs ‘understanding and feeling your feelings’. 

It doesn’t have to be good. It doesn’t have to be perfect. In fact, it’s shouldn’t be - it’s an expression of our beautifully complicated and nuanced lives. 

For all of those who are hyper-vigilant, in the words of Seerut Chawla, sometimes ‘’healing’ can be perfection in disguise’.

Take with discernment obviously. Intellectualisms certainly have their place; sometimes it can become maladaptive. We can trust ourselves to work out when each one is required 😊",vh9ll3,43,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vh9ll3/expressing_emotions_vs_intellectualising_them_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
260,"Activation/Deactivation: Understanding and working with the ""Window of Tolerance"" {fa}","I saw some posts here recently describing deactivation as more of a feeling of intense anxiety and it made me think of this resource my therapist sent me:

[https://www.attachment-and-trauma-treatment-centre-for-healing.com/blogs/understanding-and-working-with-the-window-of-tolerance](https://www.attachment-and-trauma-treatment-centre-for-healing.com/blogs/understanding-and-working-with-the-window-of-tolerance)

Basically, it mentions how we all have a ""window of tolerance"" for stressful events, but insecure attachment + past trauma creates a lowered window of tolerance, as well as a lack of tools necessary for regulating to stay within that window. Thus a stressful event can then leave us in a literally ""stuck"" state of being ""on"" (anxiety, hypervigilance, panic). But the human body can only take so much before it basically ""shuts off"" and becomes stuck ""off"" (depression, dissociation, disconnection.) I think this describes activation/deactivation. I really like the visualization in the second image, especially in contrast to the first image (""healthy functioning nervous system""). The text was a pretty good read too, and they provide some tips to help with both cases (though I found the suggested activities a little ""weak,"" like when I need stimulation I want to leave the country lol. But they're a good start towards the sorts of things you can try to revert back to a calm state in a healthy way)",ve0a5w,41,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ve0a5w/activationdeactivation_understanding_and_working/,AvoidantAttachment,0

264,"{DA} Never heard of attachment theories before, this explains a huge amount about my life. How do I save my relationship and deal with my anxiety over marriage?","Edit: I think I'm actually Fearful Avoidant, but I probably have parts of both. 

I'm shocked that I've never heard of attachment theories. I've always ruined relationships when they got close, doubting things suddenly after feeling like the girl was great. With friends, I have a super hard time texting those who I like the most, and whenever I feel an obligation to text it's almost like I can't. I've always felt myself being steered towards ruining relationships and have never understood why. I like to be alone, or at least think I do, and I've always told myself that I'm completely good on my own and don't need other people. I have no problem messaging people but as soon as we get a bit closer it's like a wall comes down and it's suddenly immensely difficult. I even moved away to a foreign country 6 years ago without knowing anyone there, I think to get away from pain I felt at home after a relationship ended and my Dad was diagnosed with cancer.

Past relationships have all had the same pattern:

* either I'm not interested in the person and we don't go past a single date (majority)
* I really end up liking the person and we go through a period of intense attraction
* doubts suddenly set in (do I find her attractive? Do I actually like her?)
* the doubts get worse and worse as the guilt I feel for having them compounds
* I self-sabotage the relationship, causing fights over stupid stuff. When I feel the girl growing more distant I apologize and find a way to make up. Relationships are always a rollercoaster of romantic gestures and then conflict/withdrawal. I will also set arbitrary boundaries and requirements that eventually break the relationship (I'm leaving the country after a year, or fantasizing about breaking up, I want my freedom to travel, I'll never be happy with her because she doesn't like the same movies that I like, etc)
* relationship ends. All I can see are the positives and I then am attracted to that ""type"" of the ex for however long it takes for me to meet the next girl I like.

I took a break from dating for a year after I ended my last relationship and felt super guilty. She was great but I made sure the relationship was doomed from the start and eventually broke up with her. I took the year to reflect and only began dating again when I felt that I was ""fixed"" (this was a lie).

I've currently been dating a great girl for the last two and a bit years. It's the longest relationship I've ever had and the only one where I've been aware of my self-sabotaging behaviour and have made a conscious decision to try and fight through it. The first month was intense and we spent every day together. I then spent some time abroad and that's when the worries started. She called everyday and I had to end every conversation as it felt like she would talk for hours, which led me to feel that first pang of guilt, and the thoughts began: ""Do I like her if I don't want to talk to her for as long as she does? Does this mean she's not the one? I don't miss her. Why don't I miss her? That must mean she's not right for me."" I could feel myself pulling away and the terrible doubts set in.

I tried to incorporate lessons from my past and ignored those feelings until I came back. In person we were better but still struggled, and eventually I had to set an ultimatum that we only see each other on the weekends as I felt like I had no room to breath. Somehow, we stayed together, and actually moved in together (huge amount of anxiety of course).

Fast forward a year and a half and we're still dating. We've definitely had a lot of rough periods but I never really understood them. I still have waves of doubt which cause lots of guilt but I've tried hard to just ignore them. However, we recently had to move apartments due to eviction and it triggered a huge wave of stress and doubt about our relationship (is she the one? Am I still attracted to her? can I put up with x behaviour *forever*?). I've also had an incredible amount of pressure from her, her family, and our friends to propose. I'm talking about daily/twice-daily comments from her. This obviously has made me put the whole relationship into question and now I'm overthinking everything - all the old doubts have come back and I feel like I'm spinning and I'm terrified that I'm going to blow up the relationship now. She's older than me which has caused stress from the beginning as I know what it means (I don't want to waste her time).

I absolutely love her. She's the most caring, sensitive, loving person I've ever met. She makes me laugh all the time. When we fight (which is often, I cause a lot of fights which I now realize is probably me trying to ruin the relationship) we usually end the fight laughing somehow. She's also very extroverted and I feel suffocated a lot. She's learned to accept that I won't text or call her back in the day and that sometimes I just need to be in my room with the door closed. Some behaviours are awful on my end, like we'll plan to go out to a restaurant and everything will be okay but as we get closer to leaving suddenly I'll be in a bad mood and ruin the evening. When the night ends and she's sad I'll feel awful and try to make up, and looking back I have no idea why I did it.

I'm getting off track. At the end of the day, I love her. She's an amazing person and she makes my life better. When I'm lying in bed with her there's literally nowhere else I'd rather be. I've never felt like I can be myself so much around someone.

But I'm absolutely terrified over the idea of proposing now that I feel like the pressure to do so is immense. I've finally reached the point at which I can't prolong or run away anymore, and my googling eventually brought me here. Has anyone been in this situation before? I know that I should be looking at therapy and that's exactly what I'm going to do, but I was hoping I could get some advice from this community as well.",13dd2za,39,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/13dd2za/da_never_heard_of_attachment_theories_before_this/,AvoidantAttachment,0
265,{FA} Anyone struggle with nearly panic-like fear around dating/romance?,"Just wondering, a lot of people seem to post their experience with relationships, but I have zero relationship experience as an FA; when I'm around someone I'm interested in, I get stressed out to the point of being near a panic attack and needing to flee the situation (even if I can superficially act ""normal"" while being around them, I have to get away ASAP); dating apps are pretty much out of the question because I'm stressed out of my mind at every stage of the process. I've never even been asked out once and I'm pretty sure it's because I signal a ""get away from me"" around everyone even when that's not what I want.

Been through years of various types of therapy with no improvement. This is far from an ""exposure therapy"" or ""need more confidence"" type of situation; I have no trouble with confidence in almost every social situation except for anything romantic where my brain seems to go straight to panic mode. Now I feel it's more likely that this is just the ""fearful"" part of my FA coming up and I hope I can resolve this with some more serious attachment focused therapy, but not sure.

266,Intensity {fa},"Hey FAs!   
I kinda want to talk with you about intensity. I have an idea that most FAs can relate to having a need for some sort of intensity in relationships. At least for me, I think this is one of my most important needs. Intensity for me with a partner could be being really present with other, having deep conversations, sexual chemistry, non-sexual physical intimacy etc. If I didn't feel some sort of intensity with a person, I don't think I would be attracted to them (in my experience).   
At the same time I think intensity could be difficult to sustain in the long run, and that the intense chemstry you can have with someone often can lead to chaos (definitely don't want that), or that you only have e.g. sexual chemistry with a person, but then they're not really fit for being your romantic partner. 

I'm curious to know your inputs ... Like what is your experience with a need for intensity, do you have a partnership where that intensity has sustained etc.",y1avbh,39,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/y1avbh/intensity_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
267,Putting up walls and struggling to connect with others {FA} {DA},"I (FA) have struggled with putting myself out there and taking up space for as long as I can remember. My go-to coping mechanism has always been to withdraw after my brain starts creating the stories or to never share my full self with others. I even hold back with some of my closest friends. What's worse is I'm fully aware when I'm self-sabotaging, but I can't stop myself from doing it. 

I hold back on showing affection, saying what I'm really thinking, expressing interest in something/someone, literally anything that would display my personality. But then I worry about how this makes me look boring and not worth getting close to, so it's like I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. I don't want to be rejected for who I am but I also don't want to seem boring. 

I want to be able to connect with others better and I'm tired of getting in my own way. I hate that I avoid sharing something or reaching out to people more consistently because I'm convinced people don't care. I'm curious to hear about other avoidants' experience with this.

270,Idk what intimacy looks like when its not sexual... {fa}," my heart is breaking.

The  only relationships I have been in that I can somewhat manage to retain  are... sexual. I fuck people that I should have just been friends with.  End up dating them and then say to myself, shit, we should have just  been friends!!!

I dknt fucking  know how to relate unless its sexual and I'm so. So. Sad. I was  sexualized from such an early age that THAT is my intimacy language.  Things got so tangled up for me that I legit have no clue what to do  with people that I'm not actively fucking. I just want a whale to  swallow me up. I'm so sad and alone. I broke up with my bf, who I should  have been friends with because I'm actually GAY and highly traumatized  by men, and now despite wanting to remain friends he isn't actively  talking to me and I have no one.

How  did I get here? I never want to have sex again. I have taken up my vow  of celibacy again. I had it going for a little while at one point but  then trauma, its always trauma and then I'm fucking again. I keep  repeating this pattern, God make it stop!!! I'm so miserable. I'm 3  again and I'm alone and then I'm 12 and no one is close to me except the  ppl that keep molesting me!!!! What else am I supposed to do?  They  were my first feeling of intimacy. What am I to do? I just want to lay  here.",u6siow,40,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u6siow/idk_what_intimacy_looks_like_when_its_not_sexual/,AvoidantAttachment,0

I'm still processing a break up with a guy that treated me really well but he highlighted some of my ""poor relationship skills"" when I ended things with him. 

He asked me for better communication, better boundary setting, called me out on calling him names, and some of the other manipulative stuff I did like talk about our future etc.

273,I’m feeling confused about my attachment style {da}. Is it necessary to try to become more securely attached? I sort of see my avoidant attachment as a lifestyle.,"I am single and not dating or seeking any kind of relationship. I even tell people I’m celibate so I don’t get questions (I’m a young woman). I have friends and family who I love & am good about communicating my needs for space to them in a loving way, and when I’m in the space to be with them I’m very present to their needs too. I don’t seek new relationships, but if one begins to form I’m forthcoming with people about my behavior and actively communicate that my need for space isn’t personal. If they push back at all, for the most part I just step away and don’t build the relationship. I’m reserved at first anyway, so I would hope it doesn’t come as a loss to the other person. 

I’ve done a lot of healing work already which has led me to a lot of peace and a very solitary lifestyle, but I recognize my almost reclusive behavior comes from attachment wounds that shaped me. 

However, if I’m not causing harm and I don’t want romantic love, do I need to “heal”? I feel very comfortable and happy alone and I don’t desire to let anyone else into my life or heart. I feel whole and free by myself. Can anyone relate at all? Any input is appreciated, even tough love lol.

I don't believe I'm unlovable. I see myself as average. I know other people like me. I've done a lot of work on my self esteem in the past decade. I'm happy to say I'm just normal like other people, I'm bad at some things but good at others.

But I do see most other people as unreliable. I don't really care anymore about trying to get close with someone. I used to want it desperately but I've been disappointed by others so many times.  I used to be incredibly clingy. Now I look back on how I used to be and I cringe. As a result, I'm incredibly independent. I'm fighting back against the codependency I was taught. I also just find other people unreliable. 

A lot of codependency runs in my family. My mom was a very hot and cold person, my stepdad incredibly dismissive, my dad codependent. I've tried to learn from their mistakes and be more secure. I wasn't allowed to have self esteem, or feelings, or anything that brought me joy. If I did, it was taken away or weaponized against me.

275,{da} Has anyone managed to salvage a relationship after the other person grows apprehensive about your avoidance?,"Long story short, I’ve been in an on again off again situationship with this guy for 8 months. From the start he told me that he was fine with not having a serious relationship with me, however he wanted something stable and long term. Whenever we have a disagreement or when I’m not feeling good in the situation I shut down and go silent. After the second time I pushed him away he told me he wouldn’t chase me. 

The last time we had a serious conversation, he told me that he has begun to feel more and more distant because I say sorry but don’t change. In that moment I decided that I was gonna prove to him that I was dedicated to changing, but after a couple of days I just felt like I was the only one making an effort and so I went silent again. I didn’t ghost him or anything but it’s at the point where if I don’t reach out then I don’t hear from him. But then he blames me for the silence as if he can’t just initiate a conversation anymore. 

Basically I want to fix things but I don’t feel like I can do it if he expects me to chase him. I feel like he wants me to show him something that I’m just not capable of because I don’t want to seem needy, and his lack of enthusiasm triggers me to deactivate.

I feel like I never want to get into a relationship again because any reason other than those two isn't ""valid"" and ""being triggered by attachment issues."" All because I lean avoidant.

What if there's consistent conflict over small miscommunications? What if your friends dislike the person or think you can do better? What if you're only a month into dating and it's already tiring and exhausting? What if you've done the work and you communicate your feelings and needs, but you're incompatible for an accumulation of small other reasons: financial discrepancy, emotional needs, constant conflict / miscommunications, etc?

*Now* I feel trapped in a relationship that so clearly isn't working because I lean avoidant and I'm trying to do the secure thing, which is communicate needs and set timelines. However, my need at this point is to have a more compatible partner. I feel confident my decision to breakup isn't some underlying trauma. I don't think less of my partner. I'm tired and exhausted because it doesn't feel like the right fit. I've even told my dating partner I'm tired and exhausted and this relationship feels like more work than I'm willing to put in. They agreed and shared similar feelings. So, when can we cut the cord because it's not a right fit?



**Edit**: My tone is because I'm angry that avoidants are always made out to be monsters for leaving, but sometimes it's so clearly the best and only choice.

278,{FA} A big breakthrough via popular television,"TW: themes of suicide

Like a lot of other people I was really effected by [this scene in Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao) (if you're really sensitive to horror/monsters etc. might be best not to watch.) I couldn't sleep after watching it and felt really electric for a couple of days, actually kind of processing intensely.

The scene shows that she's been hiding from the people who love her out of shame, thinking she doesn't deserve connection and that there's something shameful about her, that she doesn't really belong. Her friends play her favorite song to try to snap her out of it, and in the end she returns to connection and learns to let others in again. Obviously this is like a perfect little encapsulation of the journey I've been on, moving from avoidance into security.

But it also felt specifically applicable to the last year, because last summer I hit an all-time-low in feeling the effects of my chronic avoidance. I actually *felt* lonely, and saw how isolated I really was. How I didn't have any deep, close, long term friendships. Not even one. I've lost all those. And I was grieving a breakup. I felt *all* of the loss I'd had in my life, which I won't go into here, and was really grieving. I couldn't rely on my usual tricks of sinking into work or projects or exercise or even spirituality or placating my loneliness with minimal and/or digital connecting. None of what usually made my inner world feel like enough for me was sufficing anymore, and I felt like I was being forced to feel the pain I usually avoid and to actually change my life. I began really trying, earnestly trying, but I was so far away from what I knew I really needed. I was getting sucked down by depression worse than ever, and hit bottom in late 2021 when I had a week of feeling completely suicidal. I was basically comatose with the suffocating pain, and my sister saved my life. In a way, the months ever since then have felt like one big long sprint, like Max in this scene, toward the light and towards love. I've still been in hell, every obstacle trying to take me out like the rocks falling around her, but I really do feel like I've been *running for my life,* committed to finding myself held by love back on earth, in the sun.

My avoidance is heavily tied to my mom. The same week that this episode came out, I had a really heavy therapy session wherein I discovered that I would subconsciously feel like I'm *abandoning* her if I were to be happy in love and start my own family. There's this enmeshed psychic tie we have, where I feel unable to really create my own life, my own family, and escape my role as ""my mother's daughter,"" but also kind of as *my mother.* The running for my life feeling, it feels like running from this twilite zone wherein somehow I'm doomed to re-live my mother's life (she has been extremely isolated and afraid in life, shutting others out, losing friends, and living completely alone and lonely for the last twenty five years, and she's likely to die lonely.) It's probably not a conscious or malicious thing on her end, wanting me to stay alone like her so she feels less alone, but somehow that's been the effect. The past few years this tie has began feeling deadly to me, I don't know how to describe it. Like it will take my life away if I can't escape it. A matter of surviving. Like it will keep me from living, like it somehow has been.

The escape started when I faced my fears and reached back out to my last ex, whom I never got over. That act was me saying, ""I believe I deserve the love you have to give after all. I surrender to it. I love you. Please, have me back."" And we've been working things out ever since. I feel like I'm creating my own family now, escaping my childhood family, essentially differentiating from my mother and proving to myself that I can have what she was never able to muster. I now I feel like I'm laying in the grass like Max in the scene was, safe and being held but still out of breath and weak.

It was Kate Bush's [Running Up That Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM) playing in the scene, and it rang in my head in the following days after I watched this episode. I didn't realize, but there's all of these lyrics in there that sort of feel like they're describing enmeshment:

>It doesn't hurt me, **do you want to feel how it feels?** Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me? Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? It's you and me.   
>  
>And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God, and **I'd get him to swap our places.** Be running up that road, be running up that hill, be running up that building  
>  
>You don't want to hurt me, but see how deep the bullet lies? **Unaware, I'm tearing you asunder, t**here is thunder in our hearts. Is there so much hate for the ones we love? Tell me, **we both matter, don't we?**  
>  
>It's you and me, **we won't be unhappy.** Come on... **let me steal this moment from you now.** Come on... **let's exchange the experience.**  
>  
>And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God, and I'd get him to swap our places. Be running up that road, be running up that hill, with no problems

I want to live in community like she never could. I want to love fiercely and bravely like she never could. I want to face the prospect of loss, and *recover from it,* like she never could. I want the psychic tie between us to be not that I lived a life mirroring hers, but that I got out. I lived. Like she never could.

280,"Update: Reconciliation, Deactivation, Cohabitation {FA}","I've posted a lot about the saga of my relationship here, and wanted to update.

In a fit of self-consciousness I actually deleted the old posts I made through a reconciliation process, so I can't link to them. Quick recap:

* I started dating a good friend of 13 years in 2019. We dated for a year and a half with me in full FA/DA mode, panicking/deactivating along the whole way, and him in full AP mode (now can see he's actually kinda FA too)—my first experience with an AP
* We finally ended things in February 2021.Over 5 months I sank into realization/grief/depression over how everything had gone and could reconnect to my love for him.
* After a lot of talking with my therapist, I decided to attempt reconciliation and we began spending time together again in August 2021. I was told in October, once we'd begun sleeping together/emotionally reattaching that he was actually also quite attached to another person he'd begun dating immediately after our separation. Oct-Dec was a hellscape of him trying to ""decide who he wanted"" and doing a terrible job along the way, maximally hurting everyone involved, until he finally ended things with her during a day-long excruciating, messy breakup in late Dec (the last week of Dec was the most painful week of my entire life as he was flip-flopping around about his decision, and essentially falling apart completely.)
   * It was all a time of lot of growth, patience, rewiring, and compassionate understanding and just deciding not to run on my end—more trying than anything I ever thought I could manage. There are plenty of ways in which I could say, ""I should not have stayed through that."" But also a lot of reasons why I should have, and decided to, and grew from the experience. It's not black and white, but overall I am glad I endured this messy chaotic moment wherein *he* was doing a lot of growing too, and now we're growing together.

So now for the update:

From January until now it's been a frustratingly slow but steadily improving relationship. Increasingly more positive than negative with each passing day.

Before, I was super uncomfortable giving our relationship a label. I hardly ever would hang out with his friends, or invite him to hang out with my friends. I spent very little time with his family, but asked him to spend a good amount of time with mine (the ""social buffer"" of having a partner in my family setting is very compelling for me.) I accidentally and purposefully talked about future plants with ""I"" and not ""we,"" and would get triggered with too much ""we"" talk. I couldn't commit to taking vacations together, but planned solo ones. We only hung out once or twice a week and sometimes that was too much for me. We texted very minimally. I had the control when it came to spending time together. I got out of bed wordlessly in the morning to start my day. We never cuddled or lingered in physical touch and I mostly avoided it. I always said that ""I'd need to feel solid and healthy in our relationship for at least three solid months before considering cohabitation""... meanwhile I was contributing to the assurance that we would never experience such stability. I *hated* our long, intense, spiraling, frequent relationship conversations but was complicit in initiating, sustaining, and being unboundaried about them.

I was in a state of constant deactivation, the same as in my last three relationships over the past decade. The ones in the years before that, I was more on the AP side, to varying degrees.

My deactivation showed up like:

* Looking at him as unattractive, specifically looking at his body with ""flaw goggles"" on
   * This lead to us being practically sexless. We also had a five month period where we didn't even *kiss*. 
* Doing the same thing about his sense of humor, choice of friends, clothing style, etc.
* Pedestaling my avoidant-ass ex boyfriend and yearning for someone ""more like him"" again or just, him again
* Staying on dating apps and looking around
* Not telling men I meet or could possibly be interested in that I'm in a relationship
* Not being public in any way about our relationship like on social media
* Indirectly being critical and judgey all the time, a few terrible instances of ridicule
* Judging everything he did as him being needy, childlike, and dependent... when much of it was also him having understandable anxiety and sadness around someone he loved not engaging
* Feeling everything he did was manipulative...  when much of that could've used more benefit of the doubt and balanced thinking on my end
* On that note \^\^ construing his strong desire/efforts to connect as manipulation
* And on that theme \^\^ construing his requests and needs as obligations/demands

Basically I was awful. Yes, I could make a list about *his* poor behaviors that 100% contributed to our dynamic as well, and I could also make a list of ways that I *did* really show up and try in healthy ways. But this post is more about how things have changed on my end.

Now I see him as so incredibly handsome and attractive and sexy, funny and charismatic and smart and practical and just overall *desirable*. I deleted the dating apps on day 1 of our official trying again, and I tell anyone I'm talking to about my relationship—even attractive single men who would otherwise ""be viable options."" I talk about him and us on social media. I see him as actually being pretty independent and mature in a lot of ways that impress me and that I could learn from, while being accepting of the ways that he *is* a bit childlike and dependent (because, so am I, just in different ways.) I give him the benefit of the doubt or voice my concern if I sense/fear manipulation. Desire and efforts to connect are embraced. Requests and needs are respected and validated, and met when possible. I speak up about my needs as they arise and so does he.

(The pedestal my ex has been on for the last six years has been knocked down. Now I think about how he couldn't hear or respect my needs, and moved out of state without telling me. How he dragged me behind him for nine months \[yes, it was my choice not to cut the line\] pushing me to end things for him, etc. We are still friends and I do still love him as a person.)

We obviously have a label and I want it. We hang out all the time and I want to. We hang out with his friends as well as my friends, and both our families. Turns out I love his family. Our parents are meeting for the first time *tonight*! I talk in ""we"" terms as much as it applies and so does he. We're planning a bunch of vacations together, and yes, I also have a solo one on the calendar too! We text throughout the day including ""good morning"" and ""goodnight,"" and on days where we've talked less, we usually talk on the phone. And I love it. Our relationship conversations are really infrequent, and when they come up are pretty direct, soft, brief, and productive. Everything else is handled in day-to-day interactions. We don't let things build up.

We're getting on the same page about the big things: cohabitation, marriage, kids, home-buying, etc. We've both always wanted those things, but he's been so afraid of a repeat of the past through this process that he's only been slowly re-opening to them. I have tried to not completely panic through this. We're already completely align with political/spiritual/financial/social/physical etc. values, needs, and boundaries so don't talk about those things much.

Cohabitation seems imminent. We're having beautiful, lovely conversations about it. Specific and logistical ones too. I have some normal and healthy fears, as I have lived alone for six years and been in my cute apartment for three, but mostly a whole lot of excitement and readiness for change and taking the leap. The other day he suggested we plant something in the yard of his house (which I will move into) to symbolize moving forward together, and it made me happy.

With this ""big step"" nearby though, I have noticed some brief deactivation ""spells"" coming up again. It's *amazing* to me how *convincing* these spells are, still, after everything! No wonder they used to run the show! I start feeling *incredibly* annoyed and irritated by him—every single little thing. I feel resentful of all we've been through, start wanting someone different, am pretty sure I'm making a terrible decision, become scared of the ways in which he does still suck at communication and conflict (while ignoring the ways he's great/improving at them), convince myself he won't ever really commit to me so maybe I should pull out, as well as thinking about how much more fun solo travel is when you're single, about all the other benefits of being single, thinking about that insanely hot guy who just broke up with his GF...

But I see these thoughts and I say, ""ok, this is probably deactivation. If it's not and there's really a problem, I trust myself that I'll be able to recognize that and address my concerns, but for now, let's see if we can turn things around,"" at which point I continue to act loving (so as to not do damage!) while giving myself a little bit of space to process things. I think about what I appreciate about him and about us, what I want for my life long-term, the realities of what it would mean if I pushed him away or ended things again, etc. —and it has taken about 30 seconds-2 minutes each time to completely dissolve the illusions of deactivating and return to the connection.

Things feel more and more secure, but most of the time, if anything, I'm a little more anxious and he's a little more avoidant—we reversed. This was more pronounced in January and has been lessening over time. I still have a lot of fear that he'll end up bailing, or won't really be able to do all the big life things we're talking about, or that if he does, it will only be because I'm kind of *dragging* him over each hump. That's my biggest fear. That's what my mom did with my dad—and what his ex wife did with him. *Eek!* But we talk about all of this, and I trust that he's grown, and that our relationship is substantially different than theirs was.

I'm also still terrified of *really* letting someone in. I do still feel fears of engulfment and not being able to live in a way that feels good for me alongside someone else. That their needs and lifestyle will simply drown mine out. I'm also noticing how I still slip into viewing myself as ""the problem, the one who messes things up, the bad one, the guilty one, the perpetrator, the one who needs forgiveness, the one who has to 'prove' herself to be loved and accepted—but probably won't ever really pull that off."" Avoidant beliefs. I think my biggest work actually lies in seeing that we are both equally responsible for the quality of this relationship at any given moment, releasing half the responsibility (and control), remembering that we're both far from perfect, no one is good or bad, no one is guilty, a victim, or a perpetrator. I've taken accountability for past mistakes and made amends, and truly done all I can do—I'm proud of how I've shown up and continue to. I have nothing to prove at this point, and am deserving of a healthy and stable love. Whenever I am able to embody all of this, our entire relationship feels immensely healthier and more connected. It also disallows him to slip into his own opposing slippery slope of being ""the good one, the one who is always giving and victimized by takers, the one who needs others to prove themselves to earn his forgiveness and love, etc.""

But I question less and less and less each day that we're doing well and are going to just keep doing better and better. That he's in this, I'm in this, and everything we want together is really (*really!*) possible! I still have concerns about some of both of our behaviors, but we've been getting through each conflict so much better than before and actually repairing. In fact, I think the most important thing for both of us is to *stop taking conflict so seriously*—to just say ""ok, here's some conflict. The integrity of the relationship is not compromised by this arising. There's no need to panic. This is survivable.""

I am so, so excited by what the future holds, and motivated to keep growing and getting healthier and healthier for my own sake first, but also for us.",ulz0zi,39,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ulz0zi/update_reconciliation_deactivation_cohabitation_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
281,Relationship anxiety feels like manipulation to me,">UPDATE 12 HOURS LATER: *this post is seeking to just allow avoidants to feel their feelings of frustration, irritation, anger, disappointment, and even the repulsion feelings we can get. It's not a post dedicated to avoiding the ways that we also cause those feelings in our partner. Of course those exist. But I'd be really curious if it's even possible for anyone to allow these feelings without asking us to \*always\* turn it around on ourselves. Can we let ourselves acknowledge these disappointments and talk about them openly with out rationalizing them away instantly?*

I could write an entire thesis-length post about this topic but I just thought maybe I'd open this up simply. If I'm with someone and they do some of the more ""maladaptive"" anxious-preoccupied behaviors, it looks and smells like manipulation to me, and makes me think less of my partner for faltering ethically (to me manipulation is a massive ethical failure... though I know we all do it to some extent.) It also makes me feel dehumanized because they're just trying to get me to do something without caring about what I want or my experience.

I don't know how to experience relationship anxiety in a partner and not have my manipulation spidey-senses go up. Compassion for it seems better, but god damn. Can it be hard.

282,"Coming to Terms with my Avoidant Attachment, Managing Resentment {da}"," I broke up with an ex of 3.5 years about 1.5 years ago. We re-entered each other's lives about 8 months ago, and I always wanted to get back together. But I could not shake these lingering negative thoughts which would evolve into resentment, coupled with shame. She was an amazing partner, but there was an age gap between us of 5-7 years. For a long while, I didn't really care about the age gap.

When I finally decided to commit fully in our last year \[consider kids, marriage, etc.\] I started to build up a ton of resentment and jealousy out of nowhere. I was unempathetic to her feelings, started thinking nasty thoughts about her \[including her age\], and started to half-ass on my responsibilities as a partner. As an example, I would feel deep-seated insecurity when I saw a hotter woman in public, or feel resentful when she didn't pay for things, even if it was my turn to pay. I began to feel constantly anxious and spaced out, despite nothing seemingly happening. I recalled the issues of my past with my parents' relationship, and didn't want to exact the same suffering on her. When we broke up, I was devastated, but felt a bit relieved that I wasn't going to do any harm nor feel constantly tortured by these episodes of negativity. I would feel such intense shame for having these thoughts about her, but not enough shame to quell these thoughts. However, I didn't realize I was dismissive avoidant at the time, and didn't know how to process nor grieve. I just hoped it would go away, and began to suppress my emotions with detachment.

8 months after our break-up, we had re-entered each other's lives - more than friends, but I was scared to commit since I could see my negative thoughts devolving into chaos and ruining our relationship again. I thought there was something wrong with me or her - *I just couldn't figure out WHAT.* When she told me she was seeing someone new recently, I went full spiral, and finally began to mourn the loss of our relationship. I realized that I never really cared about the little things I kept bringing up - I just wanted to push her away to satisfy my own ego and sense of safety.

I am devastated now that it may be too late, but I know I need to fix my issues. Explaining these issues to normal people, even my friends who I share mental health convos with, is really difficult to get across, and borderline heart-breaking at times. I'm looking for anyone and everyone who can offer sound advice or even a similar experience they've had. I know I have a long road ahead, and I am hoping that my access to a consistent therapist, a strong support network, and lots of online / academic resources can save my lapsed relationship and ultimately myself.",15eunzq,38,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15eunzq/coming_to_terms_with_my_avoidant_attachment/,AvoidantAttachment,0
283,How does an FA find peace after a break up with an SA? {fa},"Ive recently discovered that I (27F) have a fearful avoidant attachment style. I have been dating a fantastic guy (29) that has a secure attachment style.

He has been so patient and kind with me while I've tried to overcome the sense of panic and overwhelm that comes along with my avoidant attachment style. 
Yesterday I was still feeling anxious and guilty over not fully committing to him and decided to end things as I know that he deserves full commitment and love from someone. 
I couldn't overcome the feeling that I have work to do on myself before I can love again, and that he isn't 'the one' for me. 

Because of how kind and patient he was, I'm struggling now to trust my gut instinct and I can't help but feel that it's my avoidant tendencies that are pushing him away and that I'll regret this down the line.

284,{DA} {FA} How do you tell if you're not attracted or it's attachment issues? How do you decide whether to force it?,"29f here never been in anything even close to a relationship. My pattern is to fall very hard for men who will flirt if we talk in person, I have a lot in common with, but they otherwise show zero interest/initiative and eventually we slow fade from each other's lives. Confident sensitive slightly narcissistic types that I met through school/work etc.

I am preparing myself to get back on dating apps starting in January. I hate them but I desperately want to break the pattern of unrequited crushes.

My previous app experiences have involved a ton of ghosting/unmatching/etc. but I did end up meeting a handful of guys in the last couple of years. No glaring red flags, decent compatibility on paper, certainly not anything like the dating app horror stories I've heard - but I wasn't truly feeling it with any of them.

Here is my biggest issue. For every single person I go out with now, I end up wildly stressed over trying to figure out if I'm not attracted and can/should let it go, OR my attraction system is fundamentally broken because of attachment issues and therefore I need to start *forcing myself* to date guys I'm not feeling attracted to, *especially* if they are ""nice"" people (AP vibes?) rather than my usual DA type. Like not being attracted is actually the sign that I should date them harder.

I have a pattern of every single guy I've seriously liked being 100% not into me, so I feel like something is certainly broken/wrong there and I no longer trust my own attraction/feelings. It has been stressful because I don't know what to believe anymore. Feel like throwing up on a date? Feel lowkey uncomfortable with the guy hugging you good night? Hey, maybe that's a GOOD sign!! What?

I have been working hard on therapy, etc. and I have seen tons of progress in other areas of my life but unfortunately the people I am naturally attracted to has not changed.

Wondering if anyone else here has had these issues and if so how you have dealt with this. I am very close to giving up on dating altogether but I feel like I need to give it one more shot on the apps before I close up shop.",zya4zm,36,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/zya4zm/da_fa_how_do_you_tell_if_youre_not_attracted_or/,AvoidantAttachment,0
285,My partner essentially gave me {DA} a marriage ultimatum. Feeling lost.,"This is part vent/part asking for advice but I've [32/M/DA] have been in a relationship with a 30/F for just about two years. The first year and a half was wonderful and I truly, logically, believe she is a perfect match for me. 

The past ~6 months, once the shine of the new relationship faded, I found myself falling into classic avoidant behavior and have felt our relationship has almost devolved into a roommate like situation. Over that time she'd bring up things like marriage, buying a house children, all of which I brushed off and was dismissive of. 

After our relationship essentially hitting a breaking point, I finally set up time with a therapist where I learned about attachment theory and why I was behaving the way I was (I previously thought I was just in a deep depression). 

While I'm working on bettering myself through therapy, my partner has let me know they have lost trust in me and does not believe our relationship is headed anywhere due to my negative reactions to discussing future plans. It is very important to her to be married, have a family, have a house. I - in theory - want those things, but my stomach turns every time we discuss it. I get a fight or flight reaction where I wish I could just snap my fingers and be transported away. 

My partner is supportive of me bettering my self through therapy, loves me deeply, but has been very blunt with me that she is not getting what she wants and, as a woman over 30, feels she is wasting valuable time with me. She has let me know if I don't make tangible steps toward planning a future in the next two months she will be leaving to find someone who actually wants to marry her. 

I feel so lost. Logically, I know I love her, I know this is a good thing, but my stomach churns even just thinking about it. While I'm happy with how my therapy is going, I don't think I will make meaningful progress in the time and my therapist has told me I can't rush progress.

edit: as further color, I haven't really discussed my DA in depth with her. I mentioned I am avoidant and gave a super brief explanation of what that is and left it at that. I'm not sure if it'll help give more context or confirm what she already believes (a lot of online articles are pretty harsh on avoidants) My therapist seemed to shy away from discussing it with others until I better understand my specific circumstances.",x96tok,36,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/x96tok/my_partner_essentially_gave_me_da_a_marriage/,AvoidantAttachment,0

288,{FA} long but hopeful post processing my first healthy romantic connection,"I’m 30f and I’m dating 29m. This is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. 

We’ve dated weekly since March (friends previously for 12 years) and he talks to me every day. He brings me gifts and compliments me. He plans dates seamlessly and pays. He encourages me and is curious about me. He is open about wanting this to work but reassuring that there’s no pressure. 

Basically all the normal things in a healthy relationship. It feels so confronting as I’ve never been treated this way (barely ever kindly and sometimes not even safely) before. I’ve always dated men more avoidant than me, not self aware, and usually toxic. 

Some things I’m processing:

1. It has been triggering my FA traits. Mainly avoidance, at first I devalued him a lot in my head and I put some roadblocks between us at points. But logically I could see and feel what a great man he is and that was enough to give me the courage to tell him relationships are hard for me. He was so kind and validating. I have been able to tell him every time I’ve felt like pushing him away instead of actually doing it (whilst making sure he knows it’s me and not him). He is so patient and reassuring and lets me take the space I need.

2. Telling him I feel like running and having that heard and accepted (he tells me there’s no rush or pressure) actually releases the need to run and makes me feel more connected with him. I don’t feel trapped so I don’t devalue him which stops me feeling guilty, which stops me resenting him or worrying I’ll hurt him, which stops me associating him with negative feelings, which stops me needing to run!


3. A lot of sadness is coming up for me. Even a month or so in I feel so calm and supported. My nervous system feels properly regulated for the first time in my adult life! It is impacting every area of my life as I am able to tolerate more without overwhelm 
It makes me sad bc I am getting a glimpse at what a stark disadvantage I have been as someone with a chronically dysregulated nervous system and a broken picker. None of my friends will ever understand that as they’re all in healthy secure long term relationships, not ones that leave their physiology fighting for survival.

4. I am afraid. Because of the above and my hope for this guy I am equally excited and afraid of the future. My fear of abandonment is strong and I sometimes get nightmares of him flipping out on me and showing his ‘true’ colours. I’m hoping this will subside with time and as I begin to trust him more.",u7rani,39,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u7rani/fa_long_but_hopeful_post_processing_my_first/,AvoidantAttachment,0

There is so much online dating advice that is really just blame, disgust, labeling and honestly what I feel to be a projection of peoples own insecure attachments that they themselves are blind to. So much labeling of people as monsters and narcissists, run etc. 

I'm not saying that the words spoken here is how you, or I, show up in relationships.  I totally understand that in practice we struggle a huge amount. But self awareness and kindness for the human element mean so so much even when our actions may hurt ourslves or others.

290,{fa} Punching down for security.,"Trying to date someone attractive who actually has things going for them creates a lot of paranoia.

I actually dated a guy once where simply the fact that I thought he was good looking and he was interested in me convinced me that he had to have some sort of ulterior motive.

I came up with all kinds of scenarios where he had to be a con man and was planning to use me.

The fact that I had a higher paying job at the time didn't help.

My suspiciousness sabotaged something that turned out to be just a normal dude who liked me.

I tend to only not feel ""crazy"" if I'm (this sounds terrible, but I don't know how else to word it) dating someone who is obviously ""beneath"" me.

I've often had friends tell me ""dude, you can do better"" after meeting someone I'm dating.

The thing is I am actually really into them, I don't date people I'm not attracted to.

But I'm starting to wonder if the people I'm drawn to, I'm not necessarily drawn to because they have good qualities, but because I feel like it's less likely they will leave or reject me, and due to my own sense of unworthiness, align with my self view.

I know in reality and on paper I have alot going for me, but I don't feel it in inside. I almost feel like there is some invisible force field around me that makes me fundamentally worthless compared with other humans.

I'm attractive, but I feel defective.
I'm successful, but I feel like a loser.
I'm intelligent, but I feel incompetent.
I'm kind, but I feel like I'm bad.

And I feel like other people must instinctively sense this too. 

Hence why anyone with qualities who likes me must either have been duped (and it's only a matter of time before they figure it out) or they must be dirty John.

I suspect that this may be an FA thing, but I'm curious if anyone else here can relate.",th2clh,38,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/th2clh/fa_punching_down_for_security/,AvoidantAttachment,0
291,{FA} A Follow Up,"This is a story time about healing avoidance— I haven't been experiencing hardly any avoidant tendencies or having the thoughts/impulses at all  lately. At the risk of speaking too soon, at the moment it just feels... gone. So I hope it's ok I talk about some kind of realm outside of avoidant experience, but it's specifically put into contrast with that experience since that's been my primary attachment pattern as an adult.

Yesterday I [posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/sovjug/receiving_losing/hwbpf0v/?context=3) about how receiving anything good (or even an opportunity or possibility of anything good) instantly translates into a sense of loss for me. I assume that the good thing won't happen, or I'll lose it, or it'll be ruined, or it's too good to be true, etc.

The truth is, this has been largely true in my life. But perhaps (and probably) I'm unconsciously doing things to help fulfill this belief system.

But I wanted to add a few little follow-up thoughts about this.

I feel like one emotional experience that has shaped a lot of my life is grieving things that aren't gone (which feels heavily related to assuming that something good that I receive will mean immense pain.) And it feels like true, deep, real grief. I think about loved ones dying and cry myself to sleep casually. I have been grieving my lack of children for like 7 years despite still having several good years in which to have them (and even more when I started grieving...) I'm grieving the loss of a relationship I'm still in.

It's starting to kill me though, as so many things that have been my norm are. I can no longer *stand* grieving like this, before things are gone, and really need my mind to stay centered in the reality that my loved ones are still alive, I still have time to have children, I'm in a relationship that I want very much to be in, etc. How in god's name do I rewire my nervous system to be calm when everything's fine? Because it's not just thoughts, which I actually do pretty well with redirecting, it's a full nervous system hi-jack—which I'm struggling mightily to soothe.

It's stemming from my avoidance dissolving. The emotions that I've been self-protecting from are there underneath, and enormous, and incredibly destabilizing. And because I've kept myself from feeling them, I don't have the management tools built up.

But holy mother of god, it's really true, that *everything* that used to be my norm is just absolutely unbearable at this point. Prolonged time alone. Focusing on work/projects to avoid relationships/engaging with life. And on the flip side, what used to be unbearable to me is now unfathomably desirable. It's like... *all* I want. Suddenly the hole inside of me is exposed and it is screaming to be filled.

For example, it used to be a big HELL NO, the idea of a friend or loved one just showing up to my house spontaneously to say hello. Even calling out of the blue. Now I would absolutely love that, and am starting to practice it myself. During my most avoidant-y relationship (with my ex who is now my partner again) I remember literally feeling like one night per week with my partner would be ideal for me, two at most. He said that 3-5 would be his preference, and we ended up settling on 2. Now I'd prefer 4 to... 7? And the idea of calling my partner each night that we don't spend together used to be like WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE DO THAT, and now it's the best part of my day. And, and, I'm still living my own life. Who would've thought. I still feel like an autonomous human being, just one that isn't so self-protective they can't be giving and interested in others for god's sake. I want to say ""good morning"" and ""good night"" via text, and to check in throughout the day about what we're doing and random thoughts. My phone hasn't been on do not disturb since October— whereas it was permanently on that setting from the moment I got it 8 years ago.

It just seems to me that connection—with others, yourself, the earth, and for me some kind of spiritual dimension but which mainly comes from the other three—rules it all. Nothing else really matters. I'll do my work, sure. I'll care for my body, important. I'll read and develop my interests, why not. But love. Love is it. And I'm done hiding from the intensity of that experience. I want to learn how to have the capacity for it.

But, when you've spent your life with a big fat ""do not disturb"" sign on your door (and phone), turns out, you train people to stay away. So here I am with my doors and arms flung wide open, and no one's there. And it's so, so, so vulnerable. But closing back up doesn't feel like an option anymore. I have to tenderly make my way in the world and somehow find love. I feel like I have to start building close, lifelong relationships that support one into old age now, from scratch, and holy hell is it an uphill battle.

I've always done my growth in a way that seems incredibly long and imperceptible and then explodes suddenly. It's how I quit drinking, smoking, etc. cold turkey. Just one day, I'm done with X destructive behavior and that's that. Seems some of this avoidance shit is the same.

292,A newly recognised dismissive avoidant female here.,"I never even knew what attachment styles were until today.

I've always wondered why I've been so selfish, and having no regard for people's feelings, only pretending to when others looked at me funny for not having any.

I've really really struggled to form bonds or relationships with anyone past formalities in the last few years and have an inflated sense of self on the outside yet a shatteringly low self esteem on the inside.

Its gotten worse over the last year and a half where I'm nit picking at my 'perfect relationship' looking for reasons every few months to end it. Reasons that aren't even real or that are made up in my head that I assumed was some sort of self sabotage, or was I really feeling that?!

I've abandoned everything and everyone in life. From work, to college, to friends, to best friends, and constantly preferred one night stands over meaningful relationships with wonderfully caring people.

Everything I read about dismissive avoidants sticks out like a sore thumb to me and feels like it's me writing it.

I've struggled my whole life to express feelings to the ones I love and have never told my mother I love her.

I did have my suspicions that maybe I was somewhat emotionally neglected as a child in a single parent household with an amazing hard working mother but she was depressed and I guess wasn't around much due to work. I've come to the conclusion over the last year that this is the reason for my abandonment issues and extreme struggle to consider others feelings and express my own and communicate.

I have a wonderful boyfriend of 6 years who's been nothing but caring, amazing, and normal, yet I'm this train wreck who cannot communicate or compromise, and he puts up with that.

The worrying thing is i know one day I'm gonna randomly run away from my relationship to be free instead of ending it becayse I can't communicate and I'm also scared to even open up.

I constantly convince myself of reasons to end it even though there's nothing wrong.

I never know what I truly feel or want. Ever.

Can anyone give some advice or opinions? It's gotten quite bad and I've been seeking out toxic relationships subconsciously, having affairs with old men to subsidise whatever emotionally absent mentally ill father that I had growing up.

Help needed.

Thank you.

A few things that have stuck out at me over the years which now seem to be a real trait of this DA are things like, ghosting and abandoning many great friends over the years and not understanding why I done it and never speaking to them again. Even when I was quite close to them and would hang out everyday for. Years.

Randomly convincing myself I hated my friends and picking out trivial things that 'annoyed' me and deciding they were the problem.

Blaming friends for me feeling certain ways and pretending that they were the ones bringing this negative energy to me - yet I realised this pattern happened in every relationship after x amount of time.

So quick to drop everyone and everything. Running away from jobs and school without telling anyone.

293,What do you think is the most damaging generalization about avoidants?,"To me, it's that avoidants, specifically DAs, don't want to change. 

Something that I'm learning is that the behaviors and coping skills that those who are insecurely attached have are not themselves unhealthy. It's not unhealthy for an avoidant to need extra space or time to themselves. It is unhealthy to take indefinite time and space while in a relationship with someone and not communicate. It's not unhealthy to need extra time to process serious conversations. It is unhealthy to stonewall. 

To me, people - especially APs - seem to want to change these behaviors that are natural to an avoidant. It should never be about changing someone's needs, but about helping feel safe to communicate those needs. And sometimes maybe even teaching them how to communicate those needs. 

I think this can go for anxious people too. It's not unhealthy to want to spend time with your partner; it is unhealthy to want to spend every waking moment with or communicating with your partner. It's not unhealthy to need reassurance and validation from others; it is unhealthy to need *constant* reassurance and validation from others. It's not unhealthy to want to take care of others; it is unhealthy to take care of others when that means sacrificing yourself. 

When it comes down to it, I don't think people need to change their behaviors and coping skills necessarily, but the context of how they are used should be examined. It shouldn’t be about change, but about learning to meet our needs in a healthier way. We should learn to communicate, set boundaries, and be open to being vulnerable. That's the best way to maintain relationships for anyone that is insecurely attached.

294,Don’t let yourself be gaslit by other AT styles on the internet (or real life),"This is mostly an opinion piece and a vent, if you don’t want to take my advice that is fine, I’m just getting this out there. It’s not law, it’s my opinion based on years long observations of these groups.  I’m not interested in arguing with anyone or hearing about anyone’s avoidant ex.

Avoidants: Don’t let the other styles gaslight or manipulate you. 

Examples of this include:

- “You must not be a real DA if…” (you don’t act like my ex who I pinned as a DA in a reductive panicked research spiral consisting of clickbait videos and AP centric rhetoric)

- Anything thinly veiled as “curiosity” that becomes a trap for the OP or others to trap you into telling you that your experience is wrong, because they read XYZ somewhere and there’s no way you’re an individual human with real life experiences that may vary from the “Avoidants” they *always* seem to end up with. 

- Trying to convince you they know more than you do about yourself. They like to do this when you honestly respond to a question, or when one word in your several nicely written on-topic paragraphs triggers them into recalling that their ex used to say, “the” in their sentences too, therefore anything you say is incorrect because all Avoidants are unaware monsters!
🤥

- Basically cornering you into having to defend yourself or the style you identify with.  Just stop there. It’s not worth your time. The world will keep spinning and Thais will keep producing videos and there will always be a new website popping up to try to explain our deep dark thought process, so you don’t have to keep doing it. Hell, we even have a FAQ that answers the questions they ask over and over and that, for some reason, still doesn’t help them. They’re going to believe what they’re going to believe, they’re hurt and can’t take on the truth, and don’t always seem to realize we aren’t all pieces of mulch from one big DA tree. You don’t have to waste your time or play the game with them. 

- Don’t put up with their emotional dumping about their ex ESPECIALLY when it has nothing to do with what you’re talking about. Many times this leads you to being called a classic avoidant or worse, when in reality they’re acting unhinged and inappropriate. See also: Heidi Priebe’s video on emotional dumping. 

- They are using people to soothe. Strangers, even.  Many questions they ask are answered all over the place. They want attention, and validation, and unless phrased “just so”, responses are not acceptable and certainly NOT what they want to hear. Be careful about getting sucked in. Be careful about enabling this. 

- Many of us Avoidants in these groups are leaps and bounds more self aware and knowledgeable about AT than they are - both the people who discovered AT last night when they didn’t get a text back, as well as most, if not all the “avoidants” they are complaining about. So our self awareness - I question how much that even answers their questions. And I mean, truly answers the question, more than it provides a temporary bandaid for their own wound. Besides, they’ll be back again tomorrow, or next week, asking another version of the same question.  Don’t do their emotional labor for them, it’s not your job, you’re internet strangers, not their therapist. There’s no way we are getting the full story, either. 

- Don’t let them tell you what you have to do to be XYZ unless you ask. It’s intrusion, unsolicited advice which can be manipulation and a sign of their own dysfunction, and there’s no way they actually know unless they are in the field or went through it themselves. The rest is enmeshed mumbo jumbo they picked up from possibly a questionable source. What might work for an anxious person may not work for avoidant attachment. Do your own research. Don’t let them trample you and convince you you can’t change or aren’t doing it right - many times they talk to us the way they want to talk to whoever they’re mad at. You don’t have to take that on. You don’t have to believe the affirmations they’ve used to convince themselves avoidants can’t change, or are narcissists, etc. 🤥

- They ask a leading question or anything in a very hostile manner, and then accuse YOU of being hostile or “dismissive” when you’re truly calmly disagreeing. Just walk away, it’s not worth it, they are internet strangers. Report them to the mods if they are breaking the rules and let the mods deal with it.

296,My partner has asked me to be more open with him when I'm triggered/upset...Which has just made me want to hide everything *even harder* {fa},"I'm in therapy and working on this.

FA, cPTSD from childhood trauma, relationship of nearly one year. One of the things that my partner has found challenging with me is my tendency to clam up and not talk about things that are difficult/upsetting, be it something specific to me or something related to our relationship. We've had many conversations about this. He finds it frustrating and hurtful when he finds out that I've spent an entire evening trying to hide what I'm feeling (understandable). He's asked me that I let him in just a little bit more into my mind - even just to say ""I'm having negative feelings right now"" and not elaborating until later, just so that he knows where I'm at (reasonable).

I said I would work on it. Except so far I'm just doing the damn opposite. 

Before: I get upset about something. I try to hide it. He eventually notices and asks if I'm okay. I lie briefly or ashamedly admit that there's something going on. We talk about it. 

Now: I get upset about something. I think about telling him, but I don't have the words/am scared that I'm going to start crying if I tell him I'm upset. I try to hide it. I wonder if he's noticing that I'm upset and trying to hide it. So I now SUPER try to hide it. I don't want him to be disappointed in me if he finds out that I'm trying to hide something again. He asks me if I'm okay. I say yes. I'm very convincing. 

And this is how we get to yet another evening where I got triggered over something stupid (he invited the dog onto the bed while we were cuddling) and I'm sitting here like an idiot sobbing after he's left.

It's not his fault. I think what he's asking of me is very reasonable and actually much less than what he would ideally like. I'm just like so effing broken I can't seem to budge. I've been trying to work on this since the start of our relationship and I've made the tiniest baby steps forward (like...I can actually physically speak in difficult conversations now WOOHOO I'm a functioning adult) but I just feel so goddamn stuck. 

I don't know if I really want advice because ""JUST DO IT"" has not been working for me so far. I'm just feeling really down about myself right now.",103nw35,35,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/103nw35/my_partner_has_asked_me_to_be_more_open_with_him/,AvoidantAttachment,0
297,5 Second Rule Experiment - 1 week update {FA},"So we're one week later and here is my update after trying to break negative thought patterns by counting backwards from 5.

* I was able to accomplish quite a few tasks at work that normally I would have continued to put off until the last minute. Normally I let myself be distracted, but I was able to cut that short.
* I managed to keep a clean house, and continue to interact with my kids. I actually found that by the end of the week it was easier to cut the old patterns short and act more quickly in a natural way.
* I had been putting off asking my boyfriend if he could put air in my tire because I didn't want to be a burden or be rejected. I decided to ask if I could go Monday evening (I also needed to return his son's coat that he forgot at my house), and then spent all day agonizing about the actual act of asking. I used the countdown and called him. Of course he agreed and it was proof that my avoidance/anxiety makes things harder than they have to be.
* I had also been putting off a conversation about my son's show choir concert. It's his first one, and now my sister has decided to get married that day at almost the same time. My boyfriend had said he would go weeks ago. Now my sister isn't coming, my mom is probably not going to be able to do both, and I wouldn't have a babysitter for my younger kids. I couldn't really make any plans until I talked to my boyfriend. And that was a conversation again I was avoiding.
   * Boyfriend asked me to come over and go to the store with him Saturday. I used the countdown to initiate the conversation. I basically said if he didn't want to go it was okay, but could I bring my younger two kids over for him to watch so I could go. We were driving at this point, and he told me where to turn and we were at our destination so he didn't really answer.
   * I felt myself start to shut down and deactivate. I managed to recognize this, and figured out it was because he never gave me an answer. I started to feel dismissed, unimportant. I started to tell myself if he couldn't show up for me with this, he never would show up for me. I started thinking I should end things now to avoid being hurt.
   * I experienced, for the first time, recognizing my deactivation and trying to ward it off. It literally felt like a failed space mission in my head. Alarms going off, frantically pushing buttons to save the mission, countdown to doom, screaming. It was a bizarre sensation to have it happen and be aware of it all at the same time. I breathed through it and decided to address it once back at his house.
   * Boyfriend tried to engage me on the way home and I was able to voice that I was shut down at the moment. When we got back to his house I used the countdown to restart to conversation. And he agreed to watch my kids. And that was the end of the deactivation. We went on to have a really good day/night
* Boyfriend spent the night and I was actually able to be present and enjoy it. We were watching Inside the World's Toughest Prisons and joking with each other about whether we'd stay together if one of us had a life sentence. We each agreed we would, so I asked ""Did we just make a lifelong commitment?"" And his response was ""Are you trying to rope me into something?"" I was immediately triggered. This is very similar to things he said early into our relationship when he was more avoidant and afraid of commitment/label. Since then we've talked about marriage, so it felt like a kick to the face. I was able to shut down, process internally, and then voice that he hurt my feelings. He apologized, and we moved on. I recognize that it was some deep programming of his coming up in that moment and nothing personal. 

Obviously the biggest win for me is the last one. I was able to be triggered, deactivate, recognize I was deactivated, figure out why and what I was feeling, process it, address it, and resolve it all in under an hour. I have never been able to do all of the steps so quickly. I definitely feel like that is a sign that I'm slowly rewiring my brain.

I'm interested to see how it helped with others. Please share!",y6b0iy,35,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/y6b0iy/5_second_rule_experiment_1_week_update_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
298,Inner voice invalidating emotions? {DA} {FA},"I (FA, DA leaning) recently went through a breakup and since then I've realized a pattern: I constantly second guess my feelings emotions.

It happened during the relationship. When I look back I realize that when I felt positive things about my SO, I somehow didn't trust those feelings because they weren't ""strong enough"" (because I didn't feel gushy and twitterpated) or I would accuse myself of manufacturing them.

These patterns have become more obvious since the breakup. I've cried to people about wishing I felt stronger emotions, saying that I wished I felt more and I'm frustrated I don't feel more, and one pointed out that I've cried every day since the breakup, so I'm clearly feeling a lot.

Possibly the most frustrating part though has been that, in the midst of missing my SO, my psyche has accused myself of pretending to miss them so that I won't feel guilty. It's so demoralizing. I'm so sick of this invalidating voice.

Has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone found helpful ways of dealing with it?",wuuisp,37,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wuuisp/inner_voice_invalidating_emotions_da_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
299,This is precisely why over-intellectualising our emotions can become maladaptive if done in a way that further avoids 'feeling' our feelings {FA} {DA},"Dr K articulating it so well - this is exactly what I am trying to articulate in finding the value in 'feeling' our feelings instead of just 'thinking' our feelings.

Obligatory 'obviously it's good to reflect on our patterns...' yadda yadda.

This is obviously in instances where over-analysing is a way to avoid the root cause in dealing with feelings - feelings are not in themselves 'bad' - and looking for strategies to make them go away will often just make them linger; instead, if we become acquainted with sitting with uncomfortable things, we don't have to resort to constantly trying to 'fix' emotions (therefore avoiding them).

300,{da} One reason why I wouldn’t be ready for a relationship…,"I’m too dismissive. I’m sitting here, analyzing myself, and I realize how easily I feel like I could let someone go. 

I’m thinking about scenarios and I feel like if a partner cheated on me, I would feel careless and just be like, “You can go.” I feel like I wouldn’t fight for anything. Like of course, I’m sure I’d be hurt, but I think I wouldn’t have a hard time pushing that person away. I just feel like my attitude would be like, “If you wanna go, you can go.”

I’m trying to think back to what caused me to be like this, and I think it comes from past experiences of feeling easily discarded myself (and maybe just times of feeling dismissed), and so now, it seems like I put that out onto other people. Like I will discard them easily, as a result of feeling discarded easily (or just dismissed) in the past. 

I feel like a healthy/secure individual would care to fight for a relationship. But it’s like I don’t even care to. But it’s sad, because I remember what it felt like to feel discarded or dismissed, so to think about discarding/dismissing a partner and how that would make them feel…like, I should care about that. Unless I’m stuck in my head believing the dismissive beliefs that they don’t really care about me or care about losing me anyway, so they’ll be fine. 

Anyways, man, this attachment stuff is *hard.* And it’s so crazy how this stuff develops from childhood and I even think from experiences later on, but childhood mostly, of course. 

I would love to sit down with like a therapist or someone who specializes with attachment styles so I can work through this stuff. I hope to be more secure one day. I like to think I’m moving in that direction, one step at a time at least.",wdtrpd,36,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wdtrpd/da_one_reason_why_i_wouldnt_be_ready_for_a/,AvoidantAttachment,0
301,Feel myself pushing away great guy {da},"Secureish but lean towards dismissive/ disorganized. 

Been seeing a great guy for months. Considerate, funny, shit together, not scared off by my stuff, good sexual chemistry… 

We haven’t had full on sex yet, but as we get closer I feel myself wanting to push him away. This always happens. I want love, crave it, then when an opportunity is in front of me it’s like “wait wait no no not sure I want this pump the breaks!!” and finding faults. 

I’m scared he will take over my life, that I won’t be clear headed and will lose focus on my goals. Fear that there’s someone “better” that he’ll want to pin me down and maybe I never want marriage etc or living together. 

I want my personal space, no sleepovers (even if we have sex…) I don’t want to text every day. 

I told him about the no sleepovers and texting and needing to go slow without elaborating.

303,Survived multi-day trip for the first time {DA} {Earned SA},"I went on a 4-day trip with my friend and I survived with shining colors.

I've gone on a multi-day trip two other times with a different friend several years ago and it went fine but I needed to escape a few times, got irritated internally sometimes, and was anxious to get home.

This time was such a blast. I didn't deactivate once though I had zero alone-time and we were in close quarters (shared the same bed in small room).

**Compatibility**

From what I've learned, **it absolutely shouldn't be difficult to be with someone you're compatible with**. If it is, its because your core wounds are triggered (at the core, fear of rejection) or you're simply not that compatible (fear of confrontation, freeze response because you don't know how to make things work because they just don't very easily).

Basically, if you are self-aware and open to making things work with someone, this is where compatibility and your ability to express yourself takes center-stage. If you are communicating your needs but its not effective, I think the compatibility is not there. Its imperative that your partner has the skills to understand and be responsive to you. If you are too afraid to express yourself, its not on your partner; its on you.

**Interdependence**

We share peak-performing interdependence. Everything she forgot, I had and vice versa. We help one another remember all of our personal effects since by now, we are aware of each others strengths and weaknesses. We're not afraid to show our imperfections to one another and that makes it so much easier to be with someone. This is unlikely to happen without the rest of the topics being present.

**Vulnerability**

I think my friend's biggest strength that I've learned is her ability to ask for help and her expectation for others to accept her the way she is. I've studied these habits of her's and slowly incorporate it in my behaviors.

Its silly to continue to attempt showing your vulnerability with someone who can't/won't understand it. You're only putting yourself in a position to reinforce your belief that being in relationships are difficult, frustrating, confusing.

**Compromise**

There are certainly a number of things that she is a bit picky on. What balances that out is that those are things I don't feel strongly about (compatibility) and am willing to compromise on. I let her have control of these decisions 95% of the time.

>Very good because actually, you didn't have a choice.  
>  
>\- My friend on these matters

We balance this out by taking turns making choices. For instance, if she really wants to go to x restaurant, we share our meals and choose an even number of dishes and allow each other to make equal number of decisions e.g. I choose 2, she chooses 2. She's also really particular about the music we listen to so I let her be the DJ.

In the end, the compromises have resulted in me eating really good food and learning about really good music. So now, I'll tell her ""play my jam"", and she does it gladly because its music she introduced me to that we mutually like now.

**Open mindedness**

If all of the above things are in place, I think being open-minded is the turbo-boost to relationships. We are discovering more ways to spend time/have fun together by being open to experiences that one partner has more interest in than the other. In the end, we often end up experiencing equal levels of enjoyment.

**Recognizing and responding to bids for affection**

It can be difficult for us avoidants to recognize and respond to the above but its very important to be able to to not induce feelings of insecurity in our partners (and ourselves tbh). For instance, I awoke before her and spent time in another room. When she awoke, she called for me and I came to spend time with her to chat in bed. I could tell its what she was seeking by the way she called my name. I think avoidant-me would've just stood in the doorway like, ""you're awake? ok \*walks away to breathe\*"".

**Thoughtfulness**

I don't think I've observed a secure relationship that did not have a presence of consistent thoughtfulness. I'll often include her on opportunities to save money and sacrifice sharing my resources with her for her benefit. She does the same for me.

**Alone-time together**

>I'm going to put my air pods in and zone out now. Bye!

Is not offensive.

**Take-away**

My top advice to avoidants would be:

1. Wait for someone you experience compatibility with
2. Ask them for help
3. Practice saying no/offer alternate suggestions/offer what you're willing to do when making agreements together
4. Be transparent about imperfections of yours that are too cumbersome to hide (which causes us to want to hide and be alone)

Experiencing your partner being receptive to these things and showing/asking the same things of you is the beginning of rewriting your view and responses to conflict.

I have new history being written. My new history is that being with someone feels safe, rewarding, and is a blast. I now believe that choosing someone means they will listen to me and the closer I allow them to be, the more in sync we become.",u5pr49,39,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u5pr49/survived_multiday_trip_for_the_first_time_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
304,The most avoidant {da} I’ve ever been,"WARNING: This is gonna be a post where I talk about my personal experiences and how I went through and ended a relationship as an avoidant. It will be long. Feel free to skip this one if you’re mostly interested in broader or more theoretical discussions about attachment theory or the avoidant attachment style. If you feel the need to share your own story after reading mine you are very welcome to do so. Consider the comment section as a safe space. If you have any insight or constructive criticism about my behavior, I will gladly read it.

Someone recently made a post about being able to form relationships with some people and not with others and it made me think about the “relationship” in which I acted the most avoidant I ever have (let’s call it relationship for lack of better words, even though it was very far from being a traditional committed relationship). I never really shared this story with anyone, and since I’ve been planning to finally talk to my therapist about it, I thought it would be good for me to collect my thoughts write them down. 

I met a guy, in January 2021. We matched on a dating app, despite him living in another country. In hindsight it’s crazy to think that all of this was born out of a random glitch. We spent 2-3 months texting constantly and developing a very strong mental connection. We were both aware of the challenges that our situation presented, but the quality of our conversations and the romance of finding each other and getting together “against all odds” (distance, covid, lockdowns etc) were stronger. We spent every free moment we had talking and getting to know each other. Maybe I was even beginning to feel an emotional connection towards him at some point, but then he had a very busy month, during which he was also meeting with a lot of other girls, and in that time I ended up distancing myself altogether. I honestly don’t know whether it was a defense mechanism or I just naturally lost interest in him since I wasn’t getting those high quality conversations anymore - the thing about him that attracted me the most. Either way, I told him that I no longer felt the spark and that it was better not to talk anymore. Afterwards, I went no contact.

He tried to text me a few times but I never replied. A month later he sent a very long message about how nobody could compete with me even though we had never even met in person, and that somehow breached my wall. I got close to him again. We met a couple of months later, for the first time. We went on romantic trip to Barcelona together. It tested my avoidance massively as, among other things, I usually hate sharing the bed with someone else, but I managed. I really really liked him. And here we get to the part of the story were my avoidance pops up and ruins everything.

Upon coming back from Barcelona I started freaking out and sabotaging this relationship very hard. To avoid getting emotionally close to him (I think? Not sure what my reasons were really), I slept with other people, and when he asked me about it I told him the truth, which hurt him. At that point he was under the impression that we had become exclusive, but in reality we had never had that conversation before so I told him he shouldn’t have expected that from me. I went radio silence for a few days when he moved to NYC because I couldn’t handle the fact that he would be there for the whole year. He forgave me both times. In the following weeks I started oscillating between “caring a lot” and “not caring at all”, I tried to escape countless times but there was something that kept me from staying away for more than a few days. He always managed to convince me to stay. Honestly, he triggered me so much it wasn’t even funny, to this day I have never met anyone else I was so compatible and incompatible with at the same time. There was an insane physical attraction/sexual tension that bonded us and also a strong mental connection, as I’ve already mentioned. But emotionally speaking it was a total mess, mostly because I was all over the place: I refused to discuss the state of our “relationship” or even call it a “relationship”; I refused to discuss anything related to my feelings; I rejected his feelings - actually I couldn’t even believe that he had any feelings for me, my sick brain thought it was all a joke or a lie in order to trap me and/or hurt me; I consistently failed to meet his needs, both intentionally and unintentionally; every time he asked me questions such as “why do you even want to be with me” I would freeze and change topic. And yet, I couldn’t push myself to leave once and for all as I’d always done before. The roller coaster of emotions literally made me feel sick, I started having a lot of stomach issues around that time. I want to be clear here, he never displayed any abusive or disrespectful behavior. He was a great guy all around. This is entirely on me. His expectations were legitimate, after all he was a mostly securely attached person and wanted normal things that a securely attached person would have no problems providing. Unfortunately, he had demons of his own and he was strongly drawn to my dysfunctions. He was convinced he could “somehow” save me from myself. 

Anyways, to cut it short, around Christmas he was meant to come back to Europe and I was planning to go visit him during the holidays, but he ended up catching covid and then I caught it myself. I couldn’t make it to his country. Of course he spent the weeks he was here reconnecting with his family and friends, which meant that he didn’t talk a lot to me. And what did I do once again? I took the opportunity to distance myself, build another wall to keep him out and engage in more meaningless sex and random hook ups. We had a lot of arguments around that time as well. The situation was stressing me out enormously, I hated the way he triggered me, I hated the person I would become when he was around, I hated how he could be so open with his feelings while I struggled so much. I could never really express how I felt to him. Being with him was a constant reminder of how damaged I am, it was like being forced to face everything I hate about myself all the damn time. He nullified every progress I was making in therapy, but make no mistake, he never did anything wrong. This failure is mine and mine alone. Meanwhile my stomach issues were the worst they had ever been: constant heartburn, pain, reflux, throwing up.

One day he got fed up with my behavior and we had a long conversation where I also told him about my health problems and how stressed out I was. I told him I couldn’t deal with the fear and the feelings of inadequacy and defectiveness. I told him that ever since Christmas I hadn’t felt the same attraction anymore, maybe I had finally succeeded in distancing myself. He said he wouldn’t have stopped me if I had tried to run for the nth time.

That’s what I did, a few days later. Never replied to his last messages. He never reached out again. One whole year and it ended like this. But I couldn’t have done it any differently, I needed to get away both for my mental and physical health. I was constantly living in the “fight or flight” mode, I felt like I was on the brink of a mental breakdown and this “relationship” was negatively impacting me in ways that I can’t even describe. I did it to protect myself, from myself. Coincidentally, my stomach has gotten so much better ever since I cut him off. I don’t regret doing it, I genuinely believe we’re both better off this way. 

It’s been two months. Not gonna lie, I think of him every day. I am not mourning the loss of what we had though. He probably was the closest I ever got to having deep feelings for someone, but this showed me how much work I need to do, with or without therapy, in order to be able to have a healthy relationship with someone. It showed me all of my limits. In the end, I know I did the right thing. I can only hope that, while attempting to save myself, I didn’t hurt him too much",tvzgz5,38,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tvzgz5/the_most_avoidant_da_ive_ever_been/,AvoidantAttachment,0

310,deactivating when i {da} see or hear of a friend or loved one having children,"this feels exceptionally niche but it has been an issue of mine since childhood. i’m dismissive avoidant, 27F, struggle with maintaining friendships as i just don’t put the effort in, let alone pursuing romantic relationships. but i have noticed a trend: whenever i find out a friend, family member, or even a celebrity figure i develop some parasocial relationship with gets pregnant or has a child, i immediately deactivate/disconnect. this includes therapists, teachers, trusted adults. i just saw a meme page making a joke about a gender reveal for their admin (themselves) and for a second i genuinely thought about unfollowing for it.

my logical mind can understand that i must be disconnecting emotionally because on some level i believe they won’t have space for me anymore in their lives, or that i won’t be their “first priority” anymore. i’m incredibly sensitive to rejection so it’s easy to cut people off first. but it truly baffles me that this occurs even with people i would have no real relationship with. i get some relationships are parasocial and complicated, but even a meme page on instagram?

i’ve googled all sorts of variations of this question before, but obviously it gets lost in the sea of info about how we become avoidant as children, or how prenatal attachment works in pregnancy. does anyone here have any insight into this, personal or otherwise?

I have a new friend who always wants to hang out when she knows I’m not working. But when I’m not working, I always have plans with myself.

I know there is give and take with relationships. Don’t get me wrong - I’ll immediately put my own things aside if a friend or loved one is having an emergency. No hesitation. But when I’m not initiating the hang out I’m just not interested. 

Is there a way to tell someone you only want to hang out when you want to hang out without it being/sounding extremely selfish? Like can I try explaining my attachment type?

312,Getting turned off when someone is romantic {fa},"I’ve (24f) been talking to this guy (24m) for a few weeks and had a second date last night. We’ve have good convos, I think he’s interesting, but last night he started talking about sort of romance/intimacy and I felt myself freeze and detach. And then I felt so uncomfortable and like felt my body turning away even though I also like physical touch I did not want to. Is this something I can/should try and push through by seeing him more? Or is it a sign I’m not that into him? 
Idk how to deal with it or if I should voice it, it feels like a lot to get into with someone I’ve seen only a couple times.

313,Dating while being aware that I am {FA} for the first time,"I am dating a SA partner and we have been together for roughly 3 months. Logically, this is the healthiest partnership I have ever had thus far. A few months before we started dating, I pieced together that I had an avoidant attachment and am conscious about my avoidant tendencies.

It has gotten to the point that more intimate questions about our emotions and feelings for each other has been brought up, and I have found myself disengaging. I am really scared of being honest about me disengaging (but still wanting to have this healthy relationship, because they make me happy and are so understanding and emotionally available). I think that the emotional vulnerability that is required, as well as the fear or something secure and a peaceful constant is making me feel overwhelmed and wanting to take space to clear my mind. My therapist is encouraging me to lean in, regardless. 

I guess my question is how do you deal with disengaging while in a secure relationship and how am I able to allow myself that peace and manage the fear of abandonment? I really want to do it different this time.",10uppbz,36,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/10uppbz/dating_while_being_aware_that_i_am_fa_for_the/,AvoidantAttachment,0

317,I just realised the attachment pattern between me and my ex was the same as with my dad {FA},"I’ve (27F) only really had one partner I’ve had genuine feelings for, we were together for about a year. And have been fwb for some time since then. 

I just realised today that the attachment dynamic feels very similar with him as it does with my dad. 

My Dad was a great dad when I was little. Very available, containing, spent a lot of quality time with me. He then left my mum for another woman when I was 10. I mostly grew up with him and this stepmum as my mum died when I was 13. 

Since he left my mum, my dad became a lot more distant and inconsistent. When we spend time together just us (which is very rare), it’s lovely, he’s kind, caring, supportive. But whenever my stepmum is around, for some reason he’s very distant and unavailable, dismissive, never reaches out. 

Growing up, I feel like when I spent time with just him I’d feel very close and attached. I wouldn’t address any issues because I didn’t want to spoil the nice quality time. But then when the quality time ended (e.g. my stepmum returned), he’d switch and I’d feel pretty abandoned and rejected. I’d feel upset for maybe a day or so and then just feel disconnected. I definitely learned to just rely on myself because I knew he’d let me down. So instead of getting my hopes up or trying to connect I just wouldn’t bother and detach myself instead. 

With my ex, I found that at the beginning of the relationship he was pretty keen and available. And throughout the time I’ve known him, when we spend time together I feel very connected, he’s lovely and caring and affectionate. But when we’re apart he feels distant, and he avoids conversations about feelings or serious conversations. He also always put work first (I guess analogous to how my dad always put my stepmum first). So again it’s like when I’m with him and we’re having a nice time I feel attached and close. And I would never bring up anything that was an issue because I wouldn’t want to spoil the limited quality time. Then when we are apart I felt kind of upset for a day or so because he seems distant and unavailable. And so then I tend to just distance myself emotionally and detach myself instead. I tell myself I don’t need him and I’m independent and idc if he doesn’t want me. 

It’s just that same pattern of spending time together —> feeling very close —> spending time apart —> it feeling like they’re unavailable, feeling let down —> detaching and distancing myself

Idk maybe because I’m expecting them to be unavailable I over-read into things and then assume they’re being distant and so distance myself, which then is just a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. But there’s also definitely a degree of distance and unavailability on their side. 

Both relationships leave me wanting more from the other person and like I’m suppressing my needs to avoid being “too much” and pushing them away even more. I’m kind of worried that I can only feel connected to people I have this kind of dynamic with. I don’t want this because I know that ultimately it doesn’t go anywhere.  

And the thing is that with most other partners I’ve had (especially secure or anxious leaning ones), I know I feel and act like my dad or my ex. I feel close and affectionate when physically with someone, but then become detached and distant when apart from them and I’m sure give off that detached/unavailable vibe. I never feel like I have strong feelings for these people. 

Idrk where to go from here. But I just thought it was interesting that literally the only partner I’ve ever had any kind of serious feelings for displays a very similar pattern of attachment to my dad.",x2lfos,35,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/x2lfos/i_just_realised_the_attachment_pattern_between_me/,AvoidantAttachment,0

I always wanted a relationship but had my instincts work against and ended up having a lot of casual sex for the closeness I guess. My friend is very similar in that we both fall for unavailable people and have a phantom ""ex"" as a buffer to a real relationship, when someone is more interested in us they are automatically less attractive.

320,inability to attach and feel even when the fear is gone? {FA},"I recently went through a lot of therapy to get to the point where I could spend time with my SO without feeling anxious or experiencing the ick factor.

Unfortunately since then, even though I now can spend time with him in a calm state, without panicking, without feeling repelled, I still feel little to no attachment. 

After an examination of my other relationships, I've realized that I generally feel very little in all of them. I have friends that I respect, appreciate, even delight in, but I almost never miss them and the friendships feel like work. 

Even with family I struggle to feel attached. With most of my relationships I feel like I could feel okay going a very long time without seeing/talking to them, and most of my concern would be for their sake (how are they feeling about the relational deterioration?).

I struggle to even know what love feels like. I can actively love people but I don't know how to feel it.

I care about people and I know I need a wide range of supportive relationships to be happy so I cultivate my friend group and am well loved. 

I don't feel guilty about this lack of feeling in friendships or familial relationships because in those contexts it seems to me that love is what you do, not how you feel. However, in the context of romantic relationships it's uncomfortable and scary to feel so detached when the other person loves me so much. It feels like his worst nightmare is true.

It seems like a lot of people just want to use me as their personal sound board to talk at and affirm themselves with. But they don't care about *me*, who and what I am at my core. They just care about how I make them feel.

Obviously if there are things that are particularly important to one person, like having a family for example, then if their partner had a strongly opposed view that might be a reason for saying the relationship wouldn’t work.  But more generally?

Like, when I was 30 I didn’t think I wanted a family, 20 years later I have two children, and I’m very happy about that.  My work career has also gone in a completely different direction from what I might have envisaged, but I’ve ended up in a much better place as a result.  None of the planning I did worked out, particularly, and with hindsight I’m pleased it didn’t.

326,The difference between avoidance and gut instinct {fa},"Me (F27) {FA} and my ex (M29) have been dating for 10 months. We have been on again, off again due to my commitment issues. I've been afraid to jump in fully out of fear that he isn't right for me. I think I definitely have relationship OCD (ROCD), as being unsure of people and always being 'in my head' in relationships is a common theme for me.

My ex has been understanding, patient and caring with me the entire time. Recently we broke up and have decided to go no contact for a few months for me to do some inner work. He has said that if I feel ready to try again at our relationship to reach out to him then. 

I am in therapy and doing as much as I can to centre myself and figure out what's going on in my head. I can't tell if my gut is telling me that he's just not right for me or if my anxiety is taking over and making me go into flight mode. I'm afraid of wasting time with the wrong person and leaving it too late to have children (something that happened with my older sister).

I also feel like if I just leave the past in the past and move on, at least then I can start a blank slate with someone new as all of our back and forth gives me anxiety - I'm thinking his family and friends probably hate me now for breaking up with him twice. 

I don't like the person my avoidant attachment makes me be and I can't trust myself and the decisions I've made as I'm clouded with self doubt. All I want is to be happy and free of doubt about my partner. It makes me feel so guilty as he's been so incredibly kind to me and I feel like he deserves someone who isn't filled with doubt and is with him 100%

327,{FA} {DA} Feeling pressure to stay “entertaining” to avoid boredom,"I realize this may stem from my past experiences (even friendships) where once it gets boring, I feel the relationship failing. I’m no longer interesting to talk to, I’m not the person they were curious about, I don’t give them that spark they were looking for. After a brief period, the other person stops engaging in conversation with me and I feel like I wasn’t enough to keep them hooked. I’ve always talked about my vacations, how crazy work is, wild stories, etc. because I’m not sure how else to hold their interest when my day to day is pretty routine. 

I think over the years I’ve internalized that and now put that same pressure on my own relationships, and once things get boring (or we have a day where neither of us are engaged) I get an overwhelming feeling to break up. My assumption is that I will have to be with this person forever, and if we can’t make the mundane moments exciting or get on the same page with things, we must be incompatible and it’s not sustainable long term. I’ll begin to pick at everything to prove why I won’t be happy, and we can’t last.

With friendships, we see each other on a less frequent basis so it’s not as common to get bored - the updates are fresh, we’ve missed each other, etc. With my boyfriend, I see them more often and we are in touch, so I find myself at a loss for what we would chat about at times. I find myself desperate for activities to do to fill the quiet time, and when we can’t agree on something I throw in the towel and can only see breaking up as the next step. If they’re tired while we’re out, I feel like I failed to keep them in a good mood and they’re just going through the motions. I can’t even imagine dating for another month, because it seems like we’re already out of steam - what’s the point? I remember years ago telling a guy I wanted to take it slow because I was scared the spark would die too fast if we talked everyday. 

TLDR: know we should be comfortable with silence and boredom, but as time goes on I associate it with lacking a connection and reject them before they can reject me. This behavior is heightened when I need reassurance or am deactivating. I search for signs things will not work out (I am not entertaining enough for them/I am bored of them) and then push it to where they get annoyed by me or I lose interest in them. How do I just trust the connection and let it play out?",148l9hy,37,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/148l9hy/fa_da_feeling_pressure_to_stay_entertaining_to/,AvoidantAttachment,0

329,{fa} grieving my relationship from 12 years ago for the first time,"I went through my first real heartbreak 10 months ago and during this time I have remained intentionally single to actually….. heal (during this time I also learned about AT and that I am FA lean heavily DA). This is honestly the first time I have felt this kind of pain and it is horrible (but also strangely awesome because I am also feeing highs I have no felt before). I have been a notorious relationship hopper or have fwb situations immediately after breakups. My first break up was with my high-school boyfriend that ended in college (I ended it) 
The breakup was a long time coming and tried to breakup so many times but never could go through with it. When I finally broke up with him, I kind of jumped into something new immediately and have been on that cycle  ever since (2 serious relationships since and many flings) . I started to go to therapy 6 years ago due to abuse by a boyfriend. At this point I learned to start healing a bit and met my most recent ex. it was the most healthy relationship I had to date and I fell in love with him. We ended up breaking up after 3.5 years because I wanted more commitment and he wasn’t sure  (which was a first ever in my life). 
My therapist mentioned that I would likely grieve not just this relationship but my past ones as well and I thought “not possible I feel nothing for my exes”. Well This past weekend I was driving in my car and some thought came through my head of fleeting sadness for my first boyfriend.I do not want him back or to get back together but I was sad probably for the first time since we broke up 12 years ago. I actually began to hysterically cry for my breakup with him and my most recent ex. I know my therapist said this would happen, But I felt crazy over something that happened 12 years ago for someone I do not wish to talk to ever again but weirdly am sad over.

As a background info: Our relationship is not 100% clear, we started out as acquaintances/friends but then it kind of developed into a closer relationship, we meet frequently and text almost daily. I am not really sure about his intentions though and planned to have a conversation about that tonight. 

When I read that he cancelled I immediately thought that he must be lying, that he is not really sick and maybe meeting somebody else. Or at least that he is not interested romantically. My initial thought was to back off completely. Then I pulled my self together and wrote a kind response. However, I cannot get these negative thoughts out of my mind. I am scared to put in any more effort now. I don’t want this to become a downward spiral. How can I overcome these feelings?

Edit: thank you all for your comments! Your feedback is really helpful! 
I felt pretty shitty despite trying to work on my mindset the whole day. I learned in therapy to at least allow other explanations except the worst ones.

332,Emotional hangover for a day after spending time with a partner {FA},"I’ve noticed that whenever I spend the night with a partner (whether someone I’ve just started seeing, a casual partner, or a more serious committed one) I feel like I have an emotional hangover the next day. 

I typically enjoy the time with them, and there’ll usually be a lot of affection and intimacy. But then the next day I tend to feel quite anxious and sad, kind of needy, especially in the evening. Idk whether it’s a mixture of being tired, my social battery being a bit drained, missing them, feeling a bit vulnerable etc but this always happens. And then the next day, or a couple of days after, I go back to feeling fine again and pretty detached. 

I guess I’m trying to manage it by just reminding myself that I always feel this way and I’ll probably feel better tomorrow. And to just try and get enough sleep and have a relaxing evening. 

Idk I just feel like my emotions often just feel like they switch quite suddenly. This happens even with big stuff that happens in my life.

333,Advice please - My anxiety is so bad when I feel avoidant that I feel out of control. Ending things is not even a choice - it’s inevitable. {da},"Hi everyone. First time poster here. I have just discovered this community as I've discovered about attachment styles and I have realised that I am a DA down to a tee. Believe it or not (you won't after reading this post), but I'm usually a very calm, on the level, laid back guy. I felt I had no emotions at all for a while. 

For background, I'm in my 30s (M) and in my twenties I went through some pretty dire stuff with both my parents committing suicide (on different occasions). This has certainly affected my attachement style, as I'm fairly sure I used to be anxiously attached and now I feel I'm dismissive to the extreme (perenially single, need to find the woman of my dreams - I know it's childish). 

My major problem is, that once I feel even the slightest bit of doubt when I'm with someone, it's over. My anxiety spikes so bad that I can't sleep. Can't eat. Can't do my job properly. My brain comes to the conclusion that the only thing I can do is bail. The anxiety sucks all the attraction I have for the person I'm with out. Just drains it and I feel empty and knotted inside. My sex drive disappears. 

I have actually been complaining of emotional numbness for quite a few years (wondering whether it was just avoidance). I wasn't into anyone at all. I underwent some pretty high dose psilocybin therapy in the summer to try and address that. Fast forward to last month, I met a girl on the apps. I pondered for a while because anything online has usually been a massive waste of time, but I went to meet her and to my amazement I felt a connection to her. She was kind, funny, smart. I found her physically attractive and started to get some feelings. I could definitely see myself with her. We told each other so in quite a short space of time. I probably got carried away because of how exciting it was.

But after the 4th date, a tiny amount of doubt crept in. It wasn't really anything. Something I'd noticed whilst I was still feeling good about her. But anxiety kicked in very shortly after and I felt only what I can describe as 'dead inside'. I had lost all attraction to not only her, but the world around me. Everything seemed awful, I felt like my personality had turned off like one of the islands off of the film Inside Out. Everytime she text it filled me with dread. I had told quite a few of my friends about her already and she was aware I liked her. Now I was fighting with whatever I had to not just pull the plug. I went to see her later that week, she initiated some intimacy and I just broke. 

I told her how anxious I was and she was very sympathetic. She wanted to give it time but I couldn't even live with that, I could feel no positive feelings at all and my anxiety was making me into someone I didn't even recognise. I told her I couldn't do it. She understandly felt incredibly rejected and shocked. This made me feel worse. We 'broke up' and I left her place. It was not a conscious choice. It was like my body was speaking for me.

I messaged early the next day to apologise. She said it was hard to process. Usually in these situations, bailing like this would make me feel better. This time it didn't. I felt exactly the same, only this time worried that I'd just thrown away a brilliant chance at being with someone I actually liked. Someone that suited me. Anyway I couldn't live with the idea of leading her on (as I felt my feelings were dead and gone) so I pushed her away more. She messaged 2 days later offering to just be friends and see how it went over a while. Again I pushed her away. Still too anxious. She was understandably really hurt. We hadn't known each other long, but the connection was definitely there before, and I'd just torn it up and thrown it away.

In the end in my tired, emotional and anxious state I said something that I now regret. I told her there was no way I'd manage to find her attractive again if I thought she was still interested. This caused a bit of a fight and we left each other on read. I was just so desperate to get the feelings back that I had before that I was saying anything that I thought might give it a chance. I also really didn't want to keep leading her on. But most of all, I just wanted rid of the anxiety.

I went to bed, but with a lack of closure, I still felt anxious. I wrote out a break up/apology letter on Notes on my IPhone. It wasn't great but I sent it. I had to. She understandly didn't respond well. We had a bit of a fight on text. The girl who had been so kind and understanding to me was now (probably rightfully) hating on me. She blocked me on Instagram and said some kind of hurtful things that I just didn't have the energy even to reply to.

Even this ultimate closure didn't end my anxiety. I now had the dread of being disliked by someone I clearly cared for, the guilt of pulling the rug from under her and hurting her and the realisation that I may just have got in my own way of the best chance of finding love that I'm going to get. I had all these conflicting thoughts in my head and the anxiety didn't leave. I read back the text messages and it felt like I was living in a nightmare. It had turned me into someone I didn't really recognise. The past month seemed like a blur. I couldn't settle on a task or focus on any work. My brain felt broken.

I was googling like mad and found this community. I read everything I could find instead of trying to sleep. It was cathartic. It felt good to put a label on it. I feel that I can at least now fight an enemy that I can identify. 

Since then, a couple of days has passed and my anxiety has dipped to a more manageable level at least. I don't have feelings back for this girl, but I do have an urge to contact her and apologise/explain. She's been in the right all along. I think that's probably selfish on my part though and I need to stay away and just accept she's gonna hate me, give her space. In my defence, it's not like I've lead her on too far, but I know I'd given her hope and then snatching that away feels pretty awful. 

I've got on online session with a therapist tomorrow and have also booked to see a psychiatrist next weekend, as this pattern can not continue. I will continue researching attachment styles and anxiety as best I can. If anyone is still reading this, firstly I'm sorry for the small novel, but secondly, anyone ever get like this? Or am I especially Fd up from whatever trauma my parents ended up leaving me with?

I clearly need to move toward a secure attachment style. I also need to work on controlling anxiety. I'm hoping to find advice. Hardcore meditation? Yoga? Cold plunges? SSRIs? (I'm really against prescribed psych drugs as I don't think they did anything for either of my parents). I hate this feeling so much it's kind of stirred a passion in me to defeat it. 

Any comments/advice welcome.

But I’ve been in intense therapy for the past 3+ years. And lately I’ve noticed significant changes in my dating and relationship thoughts and behaviors.

So tonight I decided to take an attachment style quiz thinking maybe I’ve moved the dial a bit. And I was shocked to get “secure” as my result!

336,{FA} Can anyone else feel their partner's energy shifts?,"So I'm FA and my partner is DA, we've had a really good last couple of weeks. He's been initiating every text, wanting to come over every other day or so, opening up to me about his cousin's passing and so on. As of this week, I feel a shift. We work together and don't want people at work knowing about us so when we see eachother at work, we usually make a silly face or say something stupid to the other in passing. Since yesterday, he's seen me and barely acknowledged my presence. I hate how sensitive I can be to energy shifts with my partner because it makes me feel so insecure all of a sudden and I revert back to feeling like I did at 7 years old when my parents would give me the silent treatment. Being fearful avoidant, when I feel this shift I normally give him as much space as possible and wait for him to come back around. But we never address the sudden shift or why it happened. So I'm always on edge knowing that at any moment that switch can be flipped. The feelings I get are an opening of my abandonment wound and a simultaneous need to self-preserve by disappearing and never speaking to him again. I'm not sure why I'm writing this, I guess I just need a little support.

337,Ego States Matrix {FA},"This is a very small breakdown of the Ego States Matrix by Brent Charleton. He actually has like an 11 part explanation on Tiktok that I watched, and an hour long YouTube video explaining it. 

I thought it was really interesting and another way to explain insecure attachment behavior. I think anxious and avoidant folks fall into the child and teen who states, with the secure being more the adult state. 

At the start of my journey I would say I was very much in the child state in all categories. As I’ve worked towards secure my worth and perfection are in the adult state, but my safety and needs would be in the teen state. 

I can see that my boyfriend is a mix of child and teen. 

Honestly it just resonated as a way to look at someone’s state of mind without the anxious and avoidant triggers that seem to cause so much polarization.",x60sx1,35,1,https://v.redd.it/e0zmah40exl91,AvoidantAttachment,0

I have been pushing him away a lot and there is not much intimacy at the moment. I also don’t feel physically attracted to him anymore. I notice how I start being interested in other men, also openly flirting with them, which I am ashamed of. I am super scared to break up though, as I am 33 and the same development has happened to me before (losing affection after 1-2 years). I deeply regretted having broken up with my previous boyfriend and I am scared the same thing will happen again.

339,I'm {da} incapable of being a good partner,"I'm a DA leaning FA. 

I usually have to force myself to see my boyfriend. I rarely look forward to it, even though I'm attracted to him. Same with texting him, I often avoid it and having a decent conversation is especially hard when just texting. Sometimes I believe, all there is between us is attraction. 

My feelings and emotions are very dull, which is also true when it comes to relationships. I'm impulsive, not very sympathetic and I make many reckless mistakes, even when I'm aware of it. I don't even really regret it but am indifferent.

My past relationship has failed because I lost interest fairly quickly. I couldn't imagine a future together and him introducing me to everyone he knows just pushed me away further.


I honestly wouldn't mind if my current partner breaks up with me. He doesn't know me well. I'm constantly censoring myself and keep private. It's not his fault, nothing is. I'm just a horrible partner and wasn't meant to be in a relationship.

When he does, I will promise to myself to not try again and fail at the cost of others. It's a waste of both time.

341,How can I stop doubting my relationship? {fa},"I (25f) and my partner (30m) have been dating for 10 months. It started off very quickly - we would spend 5-6 days out of the week together. We were both new to our city so it wasn’t the healthiest. We both started working more, and we couldn’t spend as much time together. Now we see each other 2-3x a week. I feel like we each have our own lives now (lol) so when we are together it makes it more interesting. 


We have talked about “next step” things like meeting family, traveling together and even (very casually) buying a house. He has recently given me a key to his apartment, and I’ve met his friends. Which all tells me he’s interested in me. He however comes from a very conservative culture so he does not express his feelings much. I have bought this up to him before in which he said he tries, but he would rather express through his actions vs his words. 


We are not in the “honeymoon phase” anymore but I feel like we are growing deeper into our relationship. I can’t help but feel so excited but it’s starting to trigger me that it’s getting so serious. I can start to notice my unconscious efforts to push him away. I think thoughts like “oh he’s just using me” and “he is dating other women” and “no way he likes me” “im not who he wants” etc WITH NO PROOF - just stories smh 


I have had very bad relationships and situationships in the past and I have a fear that like all my relationships will end horribly. I fear that I am wasting my time and I wonder if it’s worth it. For some reason I feel like if it won’t work out then it’s not worth it. But that (obviously) affects the way I treat my partner. I really care about him so much and I don’t think it’s fair to him.

342,what are your best tips for anxious-avoidant relationships? {FA},"FA leaning secure here and I am quickly realizing that my boyfriend who presented secure for the first several months of our relationship is actually AP. 

He struggles a lot when I don't reach relationship milestones as quickly as he does, acts mildly dejected when I don't want to talk as often as he does, has told me that he perceives in me a lack of emotional availability, has let me know that I don't compliment him often enough or in the right way, and so on.

There are also other relational issues that I think just come from a lack of maturity on his part that aren't necessarily related to AT; he can be really controlling, sometimes going so far as telling me the exact words he wants me to say in a particular situation, and he really struggles with my boundaries.

I've read and watched videos about how AP partners can thrive in relationships and one of the things I've heard is that they need a lot of reassurance and adoration. I can imagine a scenario in which I could give this to him, but I feel like I'm also struggling to get my needs met in this relationship. It feels so good to me to be in a relationship where I don't feel like someone needs me because it feels more balanced (due to the fact that I also don't have much that I need from the other person).

344,I've enmeshed with someone,"Hello folks.

I've written about a friend who I've become quite close to in the past year.

It's recently occurred to me that we've become enmeshed which is a massive fear of mine. This enmeshment has been looming but I was aware of it happening. There were quite a few times that I feared it, but the fear was a lot more mild than usual.

At this point, we are together 3-5 days/week (3-5 hours at a time). We've gone on a trip together. We have another trip planned. This is a shit load of time. Truly a shit load. We schedule things for one another, speak for one another, consult with one another, and we do activities together which is the main glue of our friendship.

I've never had a relationship with someone like this. She is really quite special but I think my work on my attachment style has a massive role in why this was possible.

For the first time, I'm not dying to get away from someone. I feel comfortable. I don't feel suffocated. I'm, without a thought, delivering the most authentic version of myself.

Through this friendship, I'm constantly practicing communicating my wants, needs, and recognizing my self worth in order to do so.

My self worth... I think was my most critical core wound. I didn't even know I had self worth issues (or abandonment) when I started this journey. It was so buried.

This issue is so incredibly simple yet so complex.

I can now see why I've had so many failed/toxic relationships in my life. It's because of me and my mostly subconscious view of myself. I assumed people would abandon me and I assumed they would do so if I showed them myself (needs, wants, etc). I didn't realize I was only holding myself back from connecting with the right people. I can see so clearly now.

I still have little blips of avoidant feelings with her. For instance, she wanted to join me in another activity that I've always done alone. I was hesitant and a little bothered by the burden of taking her along. This was my avoidant brain making shit up. In reality, I had no reason to feel this way. We do things together constantly with no bother. It ended up being quite a bit better having her with me.

As it turns out, there's hope for us avoidants :)",tyl4fi,35,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tyl4fi/ive_enmeshed_with_someone/,AvoidantAttachment,0
345,Unwillingness to share things about yourself on a meaningful level {da}/{fa},"Anybody else sit with this understanding that you cannot share yourself deeply with someone, like there's always something you'll have to keep hidden to not scare them away or something? Of course I realize I cannot realistically expect to connect deeply with people (which I long for) without allowing them in close, but I don't want to give them anything meaningful. 

Sometimes for example I'll pretend to be passionate about whether it should be cereal before milk or milk before cereal (when in reality I couldn't care less if you enjoyed soggy cereal the most) and only realize afterwards that I did it because the conversation was beginning to head in directions I wasn't comfortable with and cereal talk was an easy distraction. Plus it gives people the impression they're seeing more of my silly side. Like, oh, kindhatter is just kinda passionate about cereal. Or whatever it might be.

I'll do it if I'm cuddling with someone too and things start to get more heated. I'll tickle them, or talk about absolutely meaningless, random shit that pops into my head, and force them to give their opinion on random things. Then usually I sober up and come to see how I'm being annoying and not communicating (but I still won't communicate that I'm uncomfortable with the situation, I'll just push all of that deep down inside and go with it because of the shame I feel).

It's like I don't like being seen and yet I long for nothing else. It's weird and conflicting and it keeps me in this vicious cycle where I'll get comfortable, then overshare, feel deeply ashamed, close myself off and go into hiding, feel lonely, try to reach out and connect, only to feel ashamed of myself again because I didn't actually want them to get to know me and I never manage to completely keep things surface level despite trying.

347,I’m going on a date.,"The other week when I posted my frustrations about feeling like I’ve made no progress, someone said they’re interested in updates. (Really? Wow, thank you 😵‍💫) Well, I’ve managed to meet someone I find someone attractive. Physically AND personality. Someone who isn’t an ex. What? Uhh. Oh no.

I spent an hour or so talking to him when we met, gave him my contact info despite my instincts telling me not to. (Not my “he’s an axe murderer” instincts, rather, my “intimacy is bad” instincts). I talked with him over DMs despite my instincts telling me not to. I agreed to go on a date despite my instincts telling me not to. 

Lots of things are coming up. My old friend hypervigilance is wanting to peek its head out and “help” me navigate this. “Is he only looking for something casual? You better hope he’s only wanting something casual. What if you fall for him? Don’t you dare let yourself get excited for a date. Bad things happen when you feel good feelings toward other people. Don’t think about him so much, that’s bad and unhealthy”. Etc

I’ve joked with friends in the recent past that the perfect man could fall from the sky in front of me and I’d run the other way. Obviously nobody’s perfect and this is just a dude. But he’s got some fun things going for him. He’s got a good job as an engineer, he’s from Italy, he’s very attractive (in terms of what I like), he’s giving me attention???? In this economy?! But not too much attention? I finally understand the DA impulse to believe we aren’t “good enough” for someone with their shit relatively together— and I thought I’d worked pretty well on my self worth. Hell.

Anyway, one step at a time. It’s just ONE date. With a really hot dude. I am not gonna run away. [muffled yelling]",sdjddz,38,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/sdjddz/im_going_on_a_date/,AvoidantAttachment,0

Sometimes I deactivate without realizing it and convince myself that I don’t want or don’t like a person or an opportunity or an experience, but then in the future when the deactivation period has stopped, I realize that I was acting/thinking out of fear, and I actually do still like/want those things. It’s kind of like a “leave before I get left” thought process I guess. It’s cost me some good relationships and life opportunities over the years. For example, there was a time in my life that I almost ended my relationship with my best friend because I was deactivating really badly at that time.

349,I {FA} feel so calm... And it's freaking me the fuck out.,"Long time no see, fellow heartless avoidants!

In a surprising turn of events, I've (F/35) recently found myself becoming quite attached to someone (M/38). We'd originally connected this spring, and a sort of hypomanic mutual desire compelled us to move things way too fast, way too soon. Nothing about this was normal for me, but I felt weirdly comfortable with him - until he freaked out, backed out, and I was uncharacteristically crushed.

After six weeks - during which time I dealt with 3 deaths, 16 flights, and an excruciating exchange with my FA-ex -  I (tipsily) reached out again and we picked up right where we'd left off. He was still so into me, and I was even more into him. In addition to his wit and talent, he's so beautiful it's like staring into the sun. Again, we began moving very, very fast.

My avoidance flared up big-time, and I began catastrophizing over all the ways this was doomed to end in heartache. I hated myself for having feelings, and felt I was an idiot for thinking this man, whom I perceive as being vastly out of my league, would ever really want something serious with vulgar, shameful, unremarkable me.

All I could imagine were scenarios where once he saw the Real Hiya^(TM) he'd be disgusted and leave. The more it began to seem like this might be someone I could fall in love with and commit to long-term, the more I panicked. After every exchange, I assumed I'd never hear from him again. I'd pull away, shut down, and punish myself. ...Until he'd pop back up, sweet as ever.

Our most recent date was a week ago, and for the first time I had him over to my place. We had a few rounds of intense sex, then the conversation moved into more intimate territory. I admitted I have massive walls, but told him they'll come down with time and trust.

And then it was like a switch flipped. He suddenly became flustered, concerned about the late hour, and rushed from my apartment. I wasn't too alarmed at the time, or the next day, but over time - and as our intervening texts lost their palpable ardor - I concluded I'd been right all along: He'd finally seen what a uniquely awful person I am and wished to delete me from his life.

It's been a little less than a week since our last exchange, but rather than feeling anxious or devastated, I'm bizarrely calm. **TL;DR: I don't understand what my (lack of) emotions are telling me.**

\- Is this secure attachment?

\- Is this avoidant dissociation?

\- Is this proof I was just escaping life's problems with the thrill of romance?

\- Is this my defeatist attitude keeping me safe from love's risks?

\- Is this my mind telling me I was right about him never seeing me again?

\- Is this my body telling me everything will actually be okay?

353,"{FA}{DA} running into an ex, epiphanies, closure","As I move along in my healing journey and read back on the notes I've taken, it's really interesting to see what helped me realize I want to become secure.

I (FA/secure) ran into my ex (DA) a few months ago. It was actually kind of creepy because I had a dream I'd run into him the night before at the exact place I ran into him (irrelevant and definitely unplanned lol). We were together about 3 years, ended it around this time last year. During another push/pull period right before we called it off, that's when I decided I wanted to get help and help him too if I could.

I was completely blind to my own attachment style during our relationship and always felt so discarded/unloved by him. I couldn't understand why I wanted so badly to heal him and be accepted by someone who treated me horribly, those breadcrumbs were an addiction. To add he was covert narc as well. But I saw him as broken and insecure, just like me.

That day when I saw him, he told me he had been going to therapy and healing himself too. I felt so warm and fuzzy hearing those words. We shopped together like old friends, said sorry to each other (and meant it, at least I did), and hugged goodbye. Man closure feels so good. My feelings for him are and have been completely neutral for a long time now. I think he still has me blocked because I trigger him but I just really hope he's doing well.

354,How do I tell my partner I'm an avoidant attachment person without coming off like I have commitment issues or that I am setting the stage to break-up? {fa},"I have been dating this girl for about a month and a half, we've been talking for about two half months. I love every second I spend with her. Our dates are amazing and just spending time together we mesh really well. When we're apart... my mind starts racing. I try to find the tiniest flaws in literally everything I can, even though the rational side of me hasn't seen any red flags yet. I am careful to use the word ""perfect"" because no one is perfect and I know that that is part of my problem in the first place (breaking up with people because my brain is trying so hard to find the perfect person).

She has been incredibly receptive to me so far. I've told her I haven't really been in any relationships before despite having a fair amount of romantic partners (i.e. casual flings, but I didn't outright say that). I told her I've been having some minor depression lately and anxiety (all around this but I haven't said that outright) and I'm trying to setup to see a therapist. All of this information she has been incredibly receptive and patient with and told me if I ever wanted to talk to her about it I can.

That being said, I am still afraid to tell her. I feel like I've had at least 2-3 of these ""conversations"" where I tell her shit about me (depressed, no relationships outside of casual flings, trying therapy) in only a month and a half of dating and if I have another one she's gonna see turbo red flags and want to leave. When/how should I bring it up? Should I just wait a little bit longer or just tell her when I see her this weekend?

I want to explain that I have trouble connecting with people due to some underlying emotional trauma and that me being avoidant is NOT because I want to break up with her and my ""commitment issues"" are not some bullshit excuse to get off the hook. How do I explain that? I am so afraid that she will take this as me just wanting to weasel out, rather than me trying to work through these issues because I so desperately want to date this woman I love spending my time with. I'm also worried I'll look like a bundle of trauma and red flags and that she's going to have to invest her time and energy into a deeply broken, wounded person and it's going to scare her off. Like I'm using her to fix myself and that's all I want her there for... which is just so, so untrue. I just can't keep my head fucking QUIET from all this doubt when I have enjoyed every second I see her!

356,{FA}what counts as deactivation?,"When I'm triggered all I can think to do is run away. Not because I lost attraction to the person or found them to be irritating. It's more like they did something that made me lose trust in them, and they became a threat. So in order to stop myself from getting flooded (like actual physical symptoms) with anxiety, I throw caution to the wind and run away. This happened recently and it ended in me telling the person that I have to block them everywhere temporarily until this spiral passes because I'll drive myself and them crazy.

Is this even deactivation? What is this? Can anyone relate and how do I put a stop to this? Someone here mentioned to me about black and white thinking and ""splitting"". They were spot on. I think the person is either all good or all bad. And the moment I feel anything ""bad"" they become a villain that's trying to hurt me (even if it's not true) 

I have to run away before I engage in bridge burning. Which for me is spamming them, cussing them out, and making horrible accusations until they block me. It's a very distressing place to be so I try my best to avoid it. I've destroyed multiple relationships doing this. Saying heinous things that I would never think to say when I'm not in a heightened state.

359,{fa} I regret breaking up with her a year ago I don’t know what to do about it,"First time posting here because I only recently became aware of my attachment style and the how it impacts my relationships.

I dated this girl for over two years. I honestly felt like she was perfect and she ticked all of my boxes. I was her first love and she constantly let me know this. I struggled with this and rarely told her that I love her. It took me 4 months after she told me her feelings for me to tell her back that I loved her. The relationship was a constant battle of her just trying to get some type of affection out of me.

We broke up many times in the relationship and almost always initiated by me. I felt like I didn’t love her and there was someone else out there for me. People told me that I loved the idea of her rather than actually loved her and I believed them. I thought there might be someone else out there for me to actually feel love.

But after each time I ended up regretting my decision, feeling lonely and looking back on what an amazing person I just let go. So we’d get back together and eventually end up in the same place as before.

We last broke up a year ago because of me again. I never stopped thinking about her but I moved to a different city so I thought that the breakup was for the best. I destroyed her heart in that break up as I’d already done before. 

Now I regret my decision again. I spoke with her and she said that she literally cried for 80% of our relationship because she didn’t feel loved. I believe that. 

I wish I learned about my attachment type so that I could have worked on myself back then. 

I don’t know if I actually loved this girl and my attachment type is what stopped me from feeling it. Or maybe I just liked the idea of someone like her being in my life.

360,Getting frustrated {DA},"Small gripe. I’m just getting tired of the endless looking and feeling like I’m not interested in people. I get a fair amount of attention both on and offline, but it feels like I’m being tasked with forcing myself to be attracted to people I have zero interest in physically or emotionally. If I *do* find dudes cute in person or on dating apps, they’re almost invariably not looking for a relationship. I still talk to them and see what’s up so that I don’t cut things off before I have a chance to know, but I’ve been proven correct on that hunch repeatedly. Im burnt out looking for someone who’s emotionally available! Simultaneously, I’m frustrated by the messaging that I “shouldn’t have to chase someone”… Well who the hell is left?! I feel like I’m being presented with one of those “pick two” triangles. “Physically attractive (to me), emotionally attractive, and wants to date me”. I can’t decide how much of this is avoidance or how much of it is just the zeitgeist. I have a theory that a lot of people have become very emotionally unavailable as a result of the stress of the pandemic. Or maybe it’s just that as I slide into my 30s, peoples’ demeanors toward dating change? I’d like to think I have enough self awareness now to be fair toward people and not dysfunctionally shallow, but maybe it’s just denial on my part. 

I actively give dating apps a shot, I have multiple social engagements that put me around people regularly. Still haven’t met anyone new that seems to be doing anything for me!! I’m annoyed because it never used to be this hard for me.

361,Realising how it I actually feel due to being DA.,"Since finding this sub and reading people's comments and thoughts, I've started paying very close atte attention to what is going on in my body when I'm deactivating.

I had a long convo with an old friend that I hadn't spoken to in a year yesterday on Insta. It was a great chat, and got a bit deep. Near the end it would have been totally normal for her to say let's do something soon. 

I monitored myself as I read the message of her saying to grab dinner and it felt like someone had got a liquid concrete gun and shot me in the throat with it. The liquid concrete filled out and hardened in my brain. 

I then feel like I should reply and be normal. But I don't feel normal. So I thought I'll leave it to this morning. 

After the call I started playing the piano and I had this insane breakthrough emotional moment where I thought of past traumas and sobbed as I played. It was really cathartic. 

Then I woke up and replied normally. It felt a lot more easy. It's just becoming pretty clear how tightly linked these things are. I'm also realising as I right this that when I make plans I feel like I'm bracing to be punched in the face (my mum punched me a lot). So I'm guessing it's just linked to them letting me down or vice versa ie a feeling of abandonment.

Can anyone relate at all? I'm really happy today and thanks to everyone on this sub for pointing out what's going on with attachment styles. It's very helpful.",qtxc5h,34,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/qtxc5h/realising_how_it_i_actually_feel_due_to_being_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
362,{FA} I think I've used friendships as a crutch to avoid having relationships.,"I  turn 40 this year and I've only had a handful of dates my entire life and no relationships that lasted more than a month or so. I suppose I'm kind of on a bit of an extreme outlier in terms of how few relationships I've had. I try my best even in those situations not to totally ghost people and to try to end things with some closure but I must admit in every case I've ended things quickly needing to ""run away"" as soon as romantic intimacy starts to develop. I've made progress though for sure in communicating my feelings and staying in those spaces for longer periods of time. 

What I have realized of late though is that I think I've come to substitute close friendships for relationships. And interestingly. Long distance ones at that too. I have at least 2 or 3 female friends who have become really good friends over the years. We talk almost every single day. In each case we have met on various emotional support groups over the years and just became good friends. We have supported each other through a lot and there's hardly anything we haven't shared. Like I said we talk daily, even though we live countries apart. 

These friendships are pretty intimate for just casual friendships to be honest, we share our deepest worries, fears, daily struggles, even some romantic struggles and issues. There have been times I think where the line has blurred a bit for me or for them and things have gotten awkward. One friend in particular I believe developed feelings for me and I didn't feel the same back, I held a bit of a boundary and things got pretty awkward though we continue to talk most days. It's settled into a new norm. 

It occurs to me though that I get a lot of my emotional connection needs met through these friends in a ""safe"" way. I think the fact that they are long distance friendships makes this even more suspect that this is the role this serves for me. 

I'm not necessarily suggesting this is bad, though perhaps others may wish to chime in lol. I greatly value these frienships and I think this is good. But I think I've been using them too as a crutch not to step back into the messy territory of real romantic relationships which I still opine not having. It's interesting too because I can see in these frienships I have already built up a LOT of the tools and skills that would be helpful in a romantic relationship, communication of feelings, listening skills, compromises, boundary setting etc.

363,{fa} Is this deactivation?,"I had an experience a few months ago where I met someone at a conference and felt drawn to them right away when we started talking. Since I knew this conference was temporary, I wanted to spend as much time with them as I could even though the thought of reaching out and initiating a hangout was incredibly anxiety-inducing. We did ultimately hang out one-on-one, and I really enjoyed being really present in the conversation and asking them questions, as well as telling them about myself. I could see myself really liking them down the line, and that freaked me out so I think I deactivated. I started to really need space from them, and feel super annoyed with them when they would sit next to me at meals. Internally I'd be like ""GET AWAY FROM ME"" even though they were not doing anything except existing and wanting to be in my company. It was hard for me to talk to or even look at them.

366,Dating confusion {FA},"I suspect that I am FA. I used to latch on to unavailable people, had situationships, you name it. Now for the first time I met a high quality man and we seem to click very well, he is very very present understanding and I couldn't imagine a better partner. The only problem I think is my attachment style and some lack of physical attraction. He is not my type actually, then there are parts of him or moments when I find him very attractive again. 
In general I'm swinging all the time from hot to cold and over analyzing, I just don't know what I feel and want, and I'm just really confused and feel that I can't let it go but remain emotional distance. 
One moment I feel romantically interested in him, then I question everything again, and so on. 
In the beginning, when he used to text a lot I got turned off, but when he texted a little less I felt anxious about him losing interest. 
I know that we are only getting to know each other, but I am scared that my attachment issues lead me to sabotage the connection. 
I don't know how to differentiate between genuine lack of attraction and my fault picking(which I sometimes do very obviously when he gets too close) . 
How can I understand my feelings? and how can I prevent my issues to sabotage the relationship? 
he is great and holds space for my feelings and doubts, but I still don't know how to navigate this

Edit: Update.. I gained more clarity today when I got triggered into complete deactivation and self-isolated for the day. The trigger(s) were too much closeness. I started writing down everything that happened and recognized the pattern. Then after taking out space and engaging in self-care I started to feel interested in him again, but from a more grounded space. I feel more certain that I like him and that my doubts are driven by my fears. We spoke about my fear of engulfment and I will be more mindful about my patterns and especially make sure to take enough space for myself.. so far so good!

367,I'm so tired of being the bigger person {FA},"I've been trying to heal for a long time, but only focused on more attachment related things for about a year and a half. I've been focused on becoming more secure for my relationship and my kids. I think compared to where I was when I started, I'm in a pretty good spot right now. I'm better at smaller boundaries in all areas of my life, better at communicating, better at handling conflict, better at a lot of things.

Today I had a breakdown in therapy because I realized that while I'm doing okay, I'm so tired of being the bigger person. I could actually feel my inner child having a temper tantrum at the conversation that led up to me saying this, and I was even able to voice this. My initial reaction to every question my therapist asked was childlike resistance, but I know deep down I do care and want to make things better.

When I was a kid, I had to be the bigger person because my parents were physically present but emotionally neglectful. I had to navigate everything on my own and adapt to them being unable to regulate themselves. They are the reason I have an insecure attachment to begin with. And as an adult, I still have to be the bigger person with them?! I still hear at least weekly criticism from my mom, and I have to choose to act securely or deal with a mini tantrum from her. Most recently she criticized me for not unloading the dishwasher immediately. Well, I was sick, didn't feel good enough to do it, and quite frankly no one is going to die if the dishes stay in the dishwasher for a couple of days. She immediately responded with ""Well just because you're sick doesn't mean you get to stop doing things."" No, that's exactly what it means! Being sick means I need to rest and take care of myself. It means any unnecessary thing doesn't need to get done. But if I had said that, she would have thrown a tantrum and said self-deprecating things to make me feel guilty.

And if I want a relationship with my dad, that means I'll never get any kind of apology for his actions. I'll just have to forgive and forget, and then proceed to put in all the effort and leg work to have and maintain a relationship. Because he sure doesn't reach out.

It's the same at work. If I want to have a peaceful day at work, I have to avoid everyone who acts insecurely and gossips and takes everything personally.

My therapist agreed that there are a lot of people in my life who put me in a position to be the only one doing the thing or it doesn't get done. My parents, my children's dads, friends, exes, even my boyfriend sometimes. It's definitely not fair, but I do think for the most part I'm managing. Today I'm just tired.

And what I'm realizing is that the more secure I become within myself, the more everyone around me seems that much more insecure. Do people who are naturally securely attached ever feel this way? It's like an utter disdain for having to have any kind of interactions with people who can't just be mature for 5 minutes. Or is this somehow even more avoidance coming out of myself?",yciqjb,34,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/yciqjb/im_so_tired_of_being_the_bigger_person_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
368,{FA} My empathy is broken.,"(X-posted from raisedbynarcissists because I want a range of advice.)

I {FA leaning avoidant currently} just can’t seem to find it. My mom never showed empathy to me as a kid or if she did it felt fake. It was always “someone else out there has it worse” and “stop being a cry baby” now I find myself doing the same thing to my partner {FA leaning anxious currently}. He goes through a rough thing in his life and I feel empty. Sometimes I can muster up something but it has an expiration date. I can take the expression of pain for a bit then it sets me off. I said something awful last night and I know there are rough times ahead so I need to get this shit figured out before I fuck things up more.

Most of the time I just don’t understand how he can just let himself spiral down like that.
I know it’s fucked up. I also know to his parents it seems like he’s overreacting to things, but I also know his dad is fucked up. I don’t trust other people’s feelings towards pain. The pain is very real to the person experiencing it, even if yeah it might not be a big deal to some.

I just want to be there for him and get down in the empathy hole but I can’t without shutting down and being grossed out about his pain.

369,{FA} I feel like I was destined to fail,"I was very avoidant in my last relationship and deactivated on a least a weekly basis. I confused her so much with how hot and cold I was, and we broke up more times that I’m willing to remember.

I had a very difficult time making sense of my emotions when in a relationship with someone that I valued a lot. I would feel empty and void of any emotions when she craved affection.

I tried so hard to be the person she needed but I just couldn’t feel it. I try so hard to understand why and read a ton of articles online. Everything said that I just didn’t love her and sometimes people are not right for each other even if they seem perfect on paper.

I made the decision to let her go after 2 years because I couldn’t understand why I still felt these avoidant emotions after so long. I didn’t have an answer to her or my questions.

All of this time I resisted and stopped myself from reaching out because I believed that I didn’t love her and we’d only end up breaking up again.

Now a year later I read about Avoidant Attachments and everything makes sense to me. I know that what I was feeling was deactivation. I recognise the thought patterns that come with being avoidant. I recognise the person who I was in the relationship.

But why now? Why when it’s too late? I honestly tried so hard to find these answers in the relationship but most articles aren’t written for avoidants.

370,The True Testament to Security {FA},"If you've been here long enough, you know I'm a bit of a hot mess. But what FA isn't, amiright? I've been in this weird place with my boyfriend where's he's adjusting to a big life change that has created some distance between us. He's definitely deactivated and he's aware of it, but not sure how to fix it. It's caused me to deactivate myself, and I'm not sure how to fix it either because it feels like what we need it just to connect, but it's hard right now. Anyway, relationship is stable but currently avoidant leaning secure. 

My biggest struggle though is in being a secure parent. The kids I have full time without any help from their other parent are 12, 6, and 3. My 12 year old unfortunately has been subjected to trauma due to my abusive relationships for almost his whole life. If I had to guess I would say he's probably FA. My 6 year old also endured trauma from my abusive relationship and now the lack of presence from his father; I would say he's probably FA or AP. 

My youngest luckily wasn't around the abuse for as long, and also has the benefit of being the catalyst for my self healing journey. I've been my best self since he's been born, and definitely in the last 1-2 years. I'm actively making an effort to be a better parent all around, as well as to do better at showing up for him emotionally. 

I've been feeling pretty down and disconnected during this deactivation. Last night my 3 year old came up to me, rubbed my back, kissed it 3 or 4 times and said ""I love you. Are you happy?"" Normally he asks me this when I'm frustrated, and he does so because when he's upset I'll ask him if he's frustrated, mad, sad. I wasn't happy, but I didn't tell him that. I just thanked him for asking. 

Later he was sharing my dinner with me and randomly said ""You're so sweet. You're so sweet from sharing your waffles."" And I just sat there in awe. I think... I think I might be raising a secure child. Every day I watch him manage and express his emotions better. I watch him show empathy when someone is hurt, and validate them. I watch him validate himself (the most important thing of all). I watch him verbalize so many good things. 

And if that isn't enough motivation to keep going no matter how hard it gets, I don't know what is.",wluw84,34,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wluw84/the_true_testament_to_security_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0

374,{fa} Does this ring true? I was starved of a somatic experience of life.,"I'm more aware now that one of the deeply important things I lacked growing up were somatic felt experiences of life. It's difficult to explain perhaps but I've become more and more aware of the subtly of emotion as felt body experience. There are aspects to bonding experiences with friends now that I didn't get much as a child. 

For example the felt experience in your body that you are liked by a friend. Just the tone of voice, the laugh, tilt of the head etc. But it's more than that it's the felt experience in my own body at receiving this subtle information. A softening, melting of something tense. There are bonding experiences I've had as an adult that have made me realize... I never had these felt bodily experiences with other human beings growing up. 

And further that I think I deeply needed them as I was always a very sensitive emotionally deep child who experienced the world through his emotions intensely. I remember writting poems as a kid in kindergarten about my sensitivity. I was a deeply naive child who was bullied for his sensitivity and weird openess. As a result and parents that also couldn't meet these needs, through no fault of theirs, I can see I closed off this aspect of myself and switched to secondary circuits. 

I've been trying to compensate most of my life by living intellectually in my head and trying to perfect my understanding of myself and social interactions through models and intellectualism. But the visceral felt world of feelings isn't accessible from there and one as very little to say about the other.",up98nn,31,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/up98nn/fa_does_this_ring_true_i_was_starved_of_a_somatic/,AvoidantAttachment,0

376,Feeling really down {DA},"I don’t even know where to start. I am a 28 year old guy who recently discovered AT and I think it’s very likely I am DA or FA or something in-between.

I have spent the last few years going from girl to girl, with a similar pattern: meet someone, feel excited/interested, chase her, hang out a lot, and eventually (usually when things get more steady) get bored and wanna escape. Some of these were relationships, some were short flings, and none have lasted. This has happened 5-7 times and it is getting exhausting and discouraging.

I am currently seeing a girl with whom I have fallen into the same pattern. I have told her I think I’m avoidant, and we had two big conversations about it. The last one was a couple days ago and we almost ended up “taking a break”. She is secure and wants to feel wanted, and I want to feel like I really want her. I just can’t force myself out of the deactivation and it’s hurting us both. We ended up deciding to slow down a bit but not stop seeing each other.

I feel a little hopeless right now, like I cannot stop hurting people by leading them to think I am interested, only to lose interest when they reciprocate. I want to find love, but I seem to reject it for no good reason. And I can’t begin to piece apart why this happens to me.

I don’t know what I can do, and I just feel awful and low. I know I should look into therapy but it’s expensive and hard to find a good one.

Some encouragement would be greatly appreciated!",u60xj3,35,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u60xj3/feeling_really_down_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
377,Are people actually prepared for us to change? {FA},"Despite being avoidant myself, and knowing how capable we are of changing, I think I'm guilty of having the thought that avoidants don't put in the work. At least in regards to actual in life avoidants I know. Here seems to be different as we're drawn to this place because we've started doing the work. 

In February I ended things with my boyfriend of a little over a year. He told me mid-January that he was ready to give our relationship a real go, and then almost immediately disappeared. He came as close to ghosting as possible, forcing me to end things. In true FA fashion, I almost immediately sought validation from dating apps and I matched with someone who I really clicked with. I had given up on the idea of ever having the relationship I wanted with my avoidant ex, and so I started to seriously date this new guy. 

As soon as my avoidant ex found out, he came back around. When I ended things it wasn't something I wanted, but something I felt like he backed me into. So I started this weird dance of seeing them both. I made weekend plans with the new guy to go out of town, and I thought this weekend would give me clarity as to how to move forward. It didn't. My ex called me multiple times, which is unusual for him. 

Apparently he found out I was out of town with this other man, and he spent the entire weekend reflecting on us and our relationship. He realized that he had been treating me badly, and that he wasn't really willing to lose me. He realized that there was no reason not to go for it 100%. And since then, he's done nothing but show up. We've had these serious conversations that we never would have had before. We've talked about merging our lives, living together, getting married, meeting families. He calls me every day, and he texts me throughout the day to check in. He says I love you more than I do, tells me how important I am, and stands firm and consistent that he wants to be with me. 

But here's the thing that makes me wonder if people are actually prepared for avoidants to change. This is not easy. It's not easy to trudge through the mud of your past mistakes and past hurts with each other. It's not easy to suddenly go from avoiding everything to trying to talk things out and being triggered. He did take the attachment style test with me, and he is now confirmed FA leaning DA as I had suspected. I'm also FA currently leaning DA, and the way he's acting is definitely pushing me to be more avoidant. 

At the end of the day, you can think you've made progress. You can think you're secure and ready to tackle a real, healthy and communicative relationship. But when  your person shows up and meets you at that same level, it's easier said than done. Worth it? Absolutely. I think we have shifted our dynamic to the point that the ground is unsteady under our feet, and now we have to build back up in this new dynamic to be stable again. But I would be lying if I said a big part of me craves the avoidant-avoidant dynamic we had for months. It's easier to avoid being vulnerable, and I realized that I am also supremely uncomfortable with others being vulnerable as well. 

I wonder how many of the AP partners that come here to post and ask questions about avoidants changing would run the other direction if we actually did change for them. How many would be afraid to face the things they're avoiding in themselves? How many would be brave enough to face the fire together? Because now that it's happening to me, I feel even more exposed than ever before.",u4a8oh,33,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u4a8oh/are_people_actually_prepared_for_us_to_change_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
378,{fa} One hiccup and ready to jump ship…,"I’m currently in the best relationship I’ve ever had. We have amazing communication and he’s aware and compassionate of my avoidant tendencies. I’ve gotten to the point where I can actually feel secure from time to time. However, it comes and goes…

We barely have any conflicts arise, but when then do? My brain overrides all of the love I feel for this person and I feel an instinct to just jump ship. It’s like a complete 180 how quickly my mind can flip from feeling committed and secure to feeling so ready to run before I get hurt. And the running doesn’t even make me sad. It feels safe. It feels like I have control. It feels familiar (which is definitely a trauma response lol).

Does anyone else feel this? Like jumping ship is always the most relieving solution despite knowing deep down how self sabotaging and irrational this behavior is? Would love to hear your experiences.

379,I knew I was growing when... {FA},"Yesterday it had been 11 days since break up, 6 days since contact with ex outside of work. Basically what he ended up responding to was a text I sent apologizing for my part in our dynamic. His response was that I wasn't the problem, he was. I replied to that and then went no contact. Obviously it's hard to do that based on the fact that we work together. We aren't in the same department, but there's enough overlap I usually have to talk to him at least once daily.

I've chosen to take a gray stone approach and give the bare minimum in interactions. I'm pleasant and not rude, but not engaging. I also have apparently decided I will not be giving him any eye contact. Mainly because it just makes me angry, but also because I know he values eye contact so it's a slight dig at him I suppose.

So yesterday I need him to grab something for me so I called his station and asked. He brought it immediately, which I knew he would. I focused on the computer, not even looking at him when he came in. He tried to hand it to me and I didn't move, so he laid it on the desk. I kept looking at the computer and said thank you. He paused before saying you're welcome and walking out. I could tell the lack of acknowledgement threw him, even if just for a second.

I moved on with my day. I've been working on turning my thoughts elsewhere when he comes up. I've been focusing on myself and have overall felt pretty happy. A sense of inner peace is taking over, and I like it.

I was sitting in bed scrolling on my phone when he texted. I'm not an idiot and I knew this would happen eventually. My plan had been to just ignore it, but part of that feels like playing mind games. So instead I waited a while before responding. And then it came - he asked me to come over, and then acknowledged that it was shitty that he was asking.

Had this been a week ago I probably would have. But yesterday, I said no. Not only did I say no, but I called him out. I told him I wasn't interested in being an option. I wasn't interested in just being someone he wants to hang out with because he's drunk, lonely, or horny. That he pulled away with no explanation or apology, and after everything I've done for him over the last 5.5 years that was really shitty. I told him if he wanted to choose me, prioritize me, and actually let me in then maybe we could talk. I told him that I loved him and missed him, and this has been really hard. But as he always says, I deserve better. If he doesn't want to be that man, then that's fine, but I will not be anyone's option ever again.

I'm definitely proud of how I reacted. I don't think I was mean, but I stood up for myself. I chose myself. I called him out. He told me that he was proud of me, and that I do deserve way better. That made me really angry. It was so dismissive of the last few weeks, of my feelings, of my text. I told him I didn't want to talk anymore and to have a good night. And then I slept like shit because I was angry and conflicted, I guess. I do want us to be able to work things out, but I know I won't go back if it's the same as it was before. I know he'll need to acknowledge his part, apologize for his behavior, and actively put effort in to change it. And I can't force him to do that. I don't want to force him to do that.

I'm sure he'll reach out again at some point. But if he doesn't, it doesn't matter to me. I'm going to be happy with or without him. I just wanted to take a second to acknowledge the personal growth that I showed in that moment. That I didn't cave and run back to him even though I miss him so much.

Somehow I actually managed to pick myself first, and I don't even feel \*that\* guilty about it. I'm growing. Thank god.",su1d3c,35,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/su1d3c/i_knew_i_was_growing_when_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
380,It’s just a vent,"I wanted to talk about venting in the context of this subreddit. 

Venting by avoidant people is allowed here. Many avoidant people have trouble getting their emotions out or repress them. It can be helpful for avoidant people to get things out, and it is especially important to do it in a safe space, which is what this subreddit is.  (We still need to take into account rule 1, which is - this is a pro-avoidant sub, so rants or vents crapping on one of the avoidant attachment styles will likely not be approved.)

Time after time, people react to a vent as OP not taking any accountability, but that’s the thing - vents, by nature, are unfiltered, one sided and are not meant to be taken as someone speaking 100% fact or their real beliefs in a time they are triggered. Maybe what they said is their real belief but the point is, it doesn’t matter. It’s just a vent. 

Next time you see a vent post and start typing out a response to issue corrective actions, to tell them, “it goes both ways!” or trying to give advice by playing Devil’s Advocate, please consider: 

1) maybe sending the response is not necessary  

2) reflect on whether or not you do this in your relationships too and if it’s possibly why your friend or partner doesn’t open up to you. 

3) Ask yourself why you feel the need to help “fix” someone who is letting off some steam. Why listening or simply “sitting” with them is a struggle for you. 

In summary, venting helps many of us and doing so with people who “get” us can be an important step as we work to being able to open up to others we know in real life. It’s much better to vent anonymously online than get in someone’s face and dump. 

Maybe once in a while all we want or need is to commiserate. Sometimes we just want to be heard. Not every OP is seeking advice.",rya3kk,33,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rya3kk/its_just_a_vent/,AvoidantAttachment,0
381,A Map for Commitment,"I realized I've shared a little aspect of the healing journey I've been on in some comments but I don't think I have in a post yet:

In early 2021 a decision that I'd been rolling around as an option for oh, I don't know, 12 or so years, finally solidified: to go back to school, for psychology, to become a therapist. I think the weekly therapy I've been in the last couple of years has really helped make this decision possible. There are a lot of subtle shifts that have added up to it, along with the decade + of thinking on it and probably essentially earning a DIY degree with my own studying.

But what I didn't expect was for the decision itself to change my entire life before I even enrolled.

A couple of non-relational ways first:

This decision completely and instantaneously overhauled my career and how I'm approaching work, money, etc. in ways honestly too big to describe here but they have been profoundly liberating. Beyond what I thought I could experience.

But months into my commitment I noticed that I was finding myself able to admit that I live where I live, and stopped thinking ""I'm gonna move any month now, as soon as I decide where to move... somewhere else is better than here...""  I've lived here for nearly 5 years now, but am just now coming off my toes, convinced I'm leaving any second. It feels amazing.

So I'm just, here. Going to school. Working. Not trying to escape.

That entire process unfolded during a 7 month period where my partner and I were separated and not speaking. Throughout it, I started accessing my deep grief around that, among other things in my life and history. Not trying to escape was organically facing me with my feelings.

I was doing deep processing around my relationship with my mom, my friendships, my isolation and loneliness, climate/state-of-the-world grief, etc.

I was also reflecting a lot on my last relationship and how it was really the closest thing to what I always imagined for myself than I've ever encountered. It started to become really clear to me how I pushed it away out of fear of what it was asking of me—for actual commitment, the kind I've always thought I wanted. And I started to really see my behavior throughout it clearly. I was overwhelmed with regret but also compassion for both of us. That process was endlessly complicated so I'll just leave it there for now.

So ok, my point is this: in hindsight after all of this (and of course it's still ongoing though lessening in intensity), I can see that the decision to go to school—which is maybe the most clear, aligned, and true-to-me big decision I've ever made, kind of created a map in my body of ""this is what aligned, big decisions/commitments feel like."" I could see *how* to obtain more of the freedom/peace that the first decision provided.

I began a reconciliation process with my ex in July that has been slowly escalating (and undulating, and going through several dumpster fires of crises), and it's now been consummated. The conversations we're having are incredible. We're truly finding the way forward together as equals and with so much love but also grounding.

So here I am right now, in a completely different world than I was in this time last year—back in school, completely different career path than I've been on my whole adult life, with more and better friendships around me, content with where I live, almost no rigidity or attachment to ""my way"" in sight, and a partner by my side in mutual commitment. My stupid FA brain immediately says, ""yes, but this could all fall apart any minute, because everything always falls apart."" Maybe so, but for right now I'm at some sort of a waypoint on a long journey, and I earned my place here.

Anyway, just wanted to share.",rpyms8,33,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rpyms8/a_map_for_commitment/,AvoidantAttachment,0
382,An example of avoidant behaviour,"I just wanted to share this series of events that happened to me yesterday.

Some time ago, I'd paid for 3-month subscriptions on three dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge). I had two active conversations (one on Bumble and one on Tinder) and they were both going pretty well. I'd had a few dates, mostly off Tinder, and they've not been unpleasant, although none of them have gone anywhere. I was really struggling this time, though. I hadn't replied to anyone for at least 48 hours. I hammered out some fairly high effort but non-committal replies. When I'm trying hard I aim to get to a face-to-face date as quickly as possible. Instead, I was just hammering out ""holding material"" - not necessarily the smallest of small talk, as that's not my thing, but there's a way to make even deeply political conversations...small talk, y'know? Just discussing things everyone already knows, not really saying anything challenging, anything that might lead to an actual meeting.

Thing was, I couldn't hack it. I'd had enough. I'd made the critical mistake of telling the person I was chatting to on Bumble that I'd send her a video of me dancing. That pressure, *that I put entirely on myself*, was enough to shatter my weekend, to render my entire saturday nothing but anxiety, junk food and not a little *self-care*, if you know what I mean. Sunday wasn't much better and I needed to put an end to it. Thing is, as a DA, I just can't cope with the idea that someone else might like what I have to offer. Outside of the realm of engineering, where I can *prove* I'm correct, why would anyone think anything I could do would ever be good enough? No, I wasn't going to put myself through that rejection. I spent the weekend staring at the abyss (that thing that secure people call ""having a friendly exchange of vulnerabilities"") and decided not to step out into it.

I noticed that I'd come up on the three-month renewal period of each of my subscriptions. I cancelled all of them. I paused all of my profiles. I told everyone I was speaking to (and two new people who'd replied to me on Hinge) that my self-esteem just wasn't in a place where I could date right now. I got some friendly messages back, some thanks for explaining.

And then after doing that, literally only two hours afterwards, I sat at home and thought ""no-one will ever like me"". And it hit me rather harder than it usually does: *No you fucking idiot,* plenty *of people were willing to chat with you! YOU SHUT THEM DOWN! YOU RAN AWAY!* 

They were there. I managed to make a profile that got matches. All it really took was a tripod, a little lockdown diet and some awareness of lighting. It worked. I went on dates. But I could never really believe that I was worthwhile, that anyone would actually like me. It didn't help that most of the people that matched with me were well out of my league (yes, I appreciate the obvious contradiction in that, but I met a fucking diplomat. *A diplomat*). But that one-two punch, of cancelling all of my dating subscriptions and then *immediately afterward* declaring that no-one would be interested in me really laid it out.

It's me. It's in my head. I see reality through different glasses to everyone else. Where secures see happy villages dancing around maypoles I see the Red Wedding. Where secures see a world full of adventure, I see the opportunity to get mugged in a variety of languages. And where secures see dating as an opportunity to meet exciting new people, I see it as inducting strangers into a perverted ritual of self-flaggelation.

It's me. I'm doing it. It's in my head.",qfrlqs,35,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/qfrlqs/an_example_of_avoidant_behaviour/,AvoidantAttachment,0
383,I have no desire to be in a relationship but am addicted to the feeling of being wanted,"I am probably the most toxic person I know. I wish I was being dramatic or exaggerating but I'm not and I'm not proud of it but I don't really know how to stop.

I have had functional relationships in the past. Well...one. I'm 22 and have only had one relationship in my adult life that lasted nine months, by the end I was emotionally exhausted from having to constantly control my avoidant tendencies, and while I was sad when it ended I was mostly relieved. I remember doing a mental sigh of relief when we agreed we should split.

It has been a little under six months since that relationship ended and I have been dating around. I get asked out on dates almost every weekend and love the thrill of going on them but leave as soon as I sense they're catching feelings. I hardly ever stick around after the third date and if I do it's for the sex.

I told my friend who has an anxious attachment style this and he asked me why I go on dates if I know I'm not interested in actually getting to know the guy and I didn't have an answer other than sometimes I get lonely and want someone around. I also just like getting dressed up and going out and like ""introducing"" myself if that makes any sense.

I don't go for guys who are emotionally vulnerable or very clear that they want a relationship. I'm not a psychopath. I go for guys where I have an easy out, mostly older men where there's a decent age gap. Think 10-15 years where I can say ""oh I thought about it and I don't think anything serious can come out of this"" and it's a pretty reasonable thing to say, I also know they're emotionally mature enough to handle rejection. If I try to go out with guys around my age they get too into me too quick and I end up hurting them. I avoid this.

The thing is, I do like a lot of the guys I go out with and could see myself in a relationship with them I just...don't want to. I feel crazy and while I am young I feel like I'm emotionally stunted and will never be able to have a long-term relationship. Everyone in my family, my cousins, and sibling are in healthy long term relationships and I don't understand how. Sometimes I feel jealous of them and then remember how emotionally exhausting it is to be in a relationship and it goes away.

I have a pretty bad relationship with my older brother & father and I think this contributes my to avoidant personality. Men are kind of just sexual objects to me as bad as that sounds. If I start liking a guy I just fast forward to us in 20 years and see myself washing their dirty underwear and immediately get the ick.

I am capable of catching feelings but it's normally just a crush and it goes away. The last guy I genuinely liked and was opening up to lives in my hometown in Canada (i live 12 hours away in America) so even then I didn't have to actually be ""present"" for him and when he brought up dating I told him the distance was too much. Again, easy out. 

The worst part is this guy was perfect for me too and checked all my boxes. Still didn't want to be in a relationship with him. 

I don't know how to fix this and sometimes I feel like something is wrong with me past just having an avoidant attachment style.",qdn3q7,33,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/qdn3q7/i_have_no_desire_to_be_in_a_relationship_but_am/,AvoidantAttachment,0

386,Completely shut down and deactivated over semi normal things. {DA},"My parents are obviously the reason for my attachment style, but they’re both good people and are in my adult life (early 20s recent college grad). They’re divorced and I live with dad and visit my mom an hour away on most weekends. 

My mom recently impulse bought a bunny and chicks. She tends to be irresponsible and in lala land when she’s stressed- big disassociater. I spent most of my childhood trying to take care of the household because she was like a child. I spent all my energy trying to make sure everyone survived starting at age 9. “I don’t know what to do but I have to do *something*.” (That’s the theme of my life). I had to be in control but I literally did not have the resources or ability to control the situations I was put in. So I became a robot because I was too busy babysitting everyone else’s feelings to have any of my own. 

So fast forward to today, it’s my aunt’s birthday. My mom and I make plans to drive an hour to bring her gift and see her. I’m playing telephone with my cousin to coordinate because mom is completely checked out and making tons of work for herself so I have to make sure this birthday bullshit happens. Mom confirms the plans will work. At the same time, my dog is flipping out because the bunny and chickens so I’m trying to figure that out and make sure they stay separated, but mom likes to leave doors open. The dog didn’t let me sleep last night, he cried every 20 minutes or so. I shoot out of bed every time I hear something because I assume my moms opening the door and my dog is going to kill the little animals. I feel helpless, fearful and enraged about this situation, but that’s all internalized and I cry a bit and try to keep on swimming. The dog is incessantly crying even as I write this. It’s very triggering to me. 

Mom completely blew off our plans (saying she won’t go, telling me she already had other plans that she’s only just mentioning) and I feel like it’s my fault because I’m the one who tried to make a plan. I didn’t bring my car so I can’t go to my aunt’s alone, and frankly I don’t want to. I hate how I’m feeling and it was already going to be a lot for me to socialize with my aunt and her kids. I don’t feel equipped to go do that anymore. 

I felt overwhelmed with guilt that we (the consequences of my mother’s actions ultimately fall to me because she does not accept consequence and isn’t remorseful) stood up my aunt on her birthday. It’s my fault for even saying we would visit. In order to cope with that I’ve completely shut down. I’m okay with it if my aunt and cousins never speak to me again over this. I never want to feel like this again, and I don’t want relationships with people. I hate how they make me feel. 

My mom intererrupted me writing this to come in the room holding the bunny as my dog was already screaming and and trying to get to it. I can’t control her insanity and it is devastating. I hate loving and caring for things. The bunny is fine and I am taking my dog home.

387,{DA} 'Fake it till you make it' in terms of emotionsl connection in a relationship? Can that ever work?,"36F here. I have VERY limited romantic experience (basically a couple of unsatisfying flings in college, many first/second dates from apps and a few crushes on men at school/work). I actually thought I was asexual for some years, but there was always a niggling feeling that there was more to it. I have cPTSD from the way I was raised and am extremely detached from my feelings. I started EMDR therapy couple of months ago to try to work on this. 

I met 41M on app in September. He ticks every possible box and is just a very kind man. I was honest about my situation from the beginning and he completely took it in stride. He has been extremely good at nudging things along gently while still respecting my boundaries. Even when I told him I might be asexual, his response was that he just wanted to be with me and was willing to make that sacrifice if needed.

My hope here is that it will not needed. My ultimate wish would be to have an emotionally and sexually fulfilling partnership, but right now even typing out those words puts a knot in my stomach. As our relationship has developed, I am realising I don't even know how to form an emotional bond/connection with someone else. I have come to enjoy holding his hand and gently cuddling with him, and occasionally I have the thought that doing more might actually be nice, or at least not as impossible as it once seemed. However, at the same time I struggle to really feel anything for him. It feels like there's a massive block in the way, which I now know to be fear. I also find myself nit-picking aspects of his appearance and behaviour, small things which I know really aren't important at all, but that this fear is throwing up as distraction (there is a clear difference between this and how I would feel about someone I just wasn't compatible with).

This is turning into a very long post for a simple question, but the crux of it is that I am fed up of feeling this way. I am tired of having my life be dictated by feelings I had before I can even really remember, of not being able to enjoy the comforts of a healthy partnership that other people get. So on this occasion I have pretty much been ignoring the impulses telling me to pull away, that his voice is too soft or his eyes too small (yes, that is the level of petty I have found to pick at) and am making myself 'go through the motions' of relationship in the hope that eventually that bond/connection will form. I don't think I'm being unfair to him as I can been very open from the get-go, and I do want to be good to him as a person, I'd never try to hurt him.

My question is, is there any chance that will actually work, or am I kidding myself?",zppkce,33,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/zppkce/da_fake_it_till_you_make_it_in_terms_of_emotionsl/,AvoidantAttachment,0
388,How do you handle deactivation? {fa},"Hey, all. I'm in a healthy relationship where I feel very secure typically, but I recently realized that I actually want this to last and ""go somewhere,"" and it's making me deactivate. It's been a very long time since I've felt this urge to sabotage or abandon my relationship and I'm kind of at a loss for how to manage it. It sucks to be back in this frustrating mindset, especially since I know it's happening because I love them and want to stay with them in the long-term AND I know they want that too. I start thinking about everything that could go wrong, up to and including them simply dying on me, and then my response to that is ""this isn't worth the grief, better break up."" 

I see a bit of information here and there about physiologically calming down the nervous system in order to get out of this kind of overwhelm spiral. Just curious about how other people do that so I can find something that works for me and start feeling like myself again before it affects my relationship. 

I have a long track record at this point of being vulnerable and communicative with my now-partner, but we've only been in this relationship for maybe 5 months--before that, we were friends for about 7 months. This is the first serious deactivation I've experienced after the friendship stage, so I'm pretty strung out about it.

389,"Deep in the Fire{da}, Any Insight Appreciated"," I (34M) broke up with my girlfriend (33F) roughly 3 weeks ago. It is not the first time. Pre-breakup, I ruminated all day every day about how badly I needed to escape the relationship. Post-breakup, I ruminate all day every day about how big of a mistake I’ve made and about how to rectify it. This happened last time, too.

The flip in thoughts and emotions from pre-breakup to post-breakup is so intense and severe that I’ve been forced to come to terms with how badly I’m damaged. The biggest question on my mind right now, though, is if my extreme desire to get her back is worth pursuing - or if I would simply be repeating my familiar cycle and leading us both into more pain.

As I mentioned, I broke up with her for the first time earlier this year. We had been together for just under a year. I began feeling that I absolutely had to break up with her - that I was leading her on, that I didn’t love her, that I wasn’t attracted to her anymore, and that I was inevitably going to break her heart at some point down the line so it should be ASAP anyway. And just like now, as soon as I broke up with her and left her, I regretted it deeply.

I knew about Attachment Theory then. We had even talked about it. In the deepest pit of regret, I wrote her a long email explaining that my leaving her was entirely fear-based, that I needed to (and would!) work on myself, that I really did love her, that I wanted to make her happy, etc etc. She took me back.

Very shortly after we were back together, I began experiencing regret the other way! Now, I thought, “I got back together with her as a weak response to my own negative emotions. I needed time, not immediate reconciliation.” Additionally, I have lifelong doubts about long-term commitment, monogamy, etc; once we were back together, I reconnected with those doubts and felt, “This just isn’t for me.”

I should make it clear at this point that I think we are a very good match and I never doubted that even when I wanted to break up with her (both times). My urges and actions towards leaving her have always been about not wanting to be in a committed relationship at all.

For months, I thought about how badly I needed to end things. I felt that the relationship was holding both of us back. That I’d be happier single. 

Then, of course, I finally did break up with her and now I regret it again! Now, revisiting the Attachement Theory stuff (of course I’d somehow forgotten about it once we were back together), I feel that I’ve made a tremendous mistake and I want her back so badly!

We’ve been no contact for 3 weeks. My emotions and ruminations are telling me that I need to reach out to her. 

Logic, on the other hand, is saying that maybe I need to take real steps towards healing before I can ask for her back. And that maybe I’m not wrong about commitment, monogamy. That we need more time apart so that my feelings are clearer. I know I’ve been very selfish but I truly do not want to cause her any more pain than is necessary. 

But then, predictably, I catastrophize about the ways in which more time will harden her toward me and make it less likely that she’ll take me back.

So even if you can’t tell me what to do, maybe you can point me in the right direction? Do I sound like someone who can actually heal and be a good partner? Or do I sound like someone who's deeply wounded and is simply going to repeat the pattern again?

To be clear, I have no idea if she would accept me back, anyway. I’m willing to risk rejection. What I may not be willing to do, though, is to give in to my intense emotions right now and try to reunite when the odds are overwhelming that I will simply hurt her (and me) again.

To whoever read this, thank you. If you have any input at all, I’d greatly appreciate it. I think simply writing this helped, anyway.

TL;DR: Broke up with girlfriend recently for the second time. Both times, I experience extreme flips in emotion. I want her back again but I don’t trust myself.

390,"I tasted the magic then pushed it away, now rapt with regret and struggling to let go. Committed to growth and seeking guidance. {da} {fa-curious}","Hello avoidant fam.  Long-time reader, first-time poster.

I'm a 33yo cis-het dude with some avoidant tendencies (DA, maybe FA) experiencing first time being broken up with. I am really struggling to stop re-hashing how it went sideways or let go of hope for reconciliation. Maybe first time ever that I’ve tasted long-term potential. Feels wrong to drop what could be so good AND I know being stuck here is unsustainable.  Seeking any sort of guidance.

&#x200B;

Background:

I’ve only maintained one LTR in my life, nearly 10 years ago, with a gal who started as just a housemate and became an on-again-off-again 3-year partner - I have ended all other romantic connections within 4 months or so of origination. Of the dozens of relations that I’ve ended before they really took hold, this is the first time I’ve experienced regret and lamentation like this.  Maybe this is the first time I’ve allowed myself to actually get attached to someone?  I’m not sure.

&#x200B;

What Happened:

I met a gal on an app while traveling back in February and we slowly built a pleasant long-distance connection. She invited me to visit her for 4 days in early May and it was surprisingly good.

Like… unprecedentedly good. We were aligned in all the important ways, her personality fostered a playful joy in me and mine mutually in her.  She landed in my nervous system differently than any lover before. It felt simpler and less out of control - felt more like a soft glow of excitement instead of the racing wild stallion energy that arises historically when I’m into some one.  It felt healthy.

(We even discussed our attachment tendencies - my avoidant tendencies, her anxious tendencies - and were on the same page of leaning towards mutual security.  How I completely failed to realize what later happened while it was happening is beyond me. I suppose that’s what dissociation does.)

I remote-work-van-traveled for the summer and drove across half the country to visit her and give the thing a go. I arrived in late June and the first few days were great - she’d just bought a house and I was eager to join in on the nesting process.  It didn’t take long, however, for me to become uneasy.  Compounded by a fresh knee injury that kept me rather immobile,  I started feeling emotionally claustrophobic - struggling to express myself - like my flow of energy was clogged. Anxious and dysregulated, I started seeking the emergency exists by Day 4.  We continued to spend time together, but I grew more and more distant - so many classic deactivation techniques. We tried to sit down and talk about it several times, and I simply shut down - unable to understand or articulate what was happening.  I convinced myself that it simply wasn’t what I wanted and that I’d best try to let her down softly before she got too attached. (As if we both hadn’t already.) I more or less told her such and it started to unravel.

A few days later, she acknowledged that she wasn’t feeling it anymore herself and then traveled out of town for a week. This is when things took a novel turn - now that the connection felt truly severed and I was unable to access her, my feelings shifted dramatically.  It was like a fog had been lifted and I started remembering all the things I liked about her / started re-seeing the potential.  I wanted to be with her.  (I’d never experienced such a rapid flip about someone like this before. What the hell was going on?!)  I dove deep into attachment theory research and it became unmistakably obvious that I’d been pushing away out of some subconscious fears that I’d eventually be stuck in a bad situation - not really responding to any present tense problems.

When she returned from travels, I was eager to repair, but she expressed a firm desire to end the relationship. I became unglued. I read incessantly and wrote a PhD thesis worth of thoughts on how it went down (more disembodied hyper-intellectualization).  I wrote her a hefty letter attempting to explain myself - she thanked me for it and requested time to process.  I thought that meant she was considering a reconciliation, but apparently not - two more reach out attempts to her over the next two weeks- and she doubled down, stating that she had been “very clear” on her desire to end things and was bothered by my boundary intrusion and does not want to remain in contact at all - asking me to “please respect her decision”. (Note: I believe she has been burned by hot-cold dudes before, so her own healing likely entails assertion of strong boundaries.)

I’ve proceeded to travel solo across the country for the next two months, spending an exorbitant amount of time alone with my thoughts, rapt with regret for having fucked it up so completely.  I have respected her request and not reached back out, but consider it often.

&#x200B;

Where I am now:

Not all that different than I was two months ago. It’s a daily struggle. It’s not quite as incessant as it was before, but numerous times a day I will fall into these thought loop traps and just spin on it. If I allow myself to feel it, I will become quite distraught. I will go for several hours, sometime half a day without thinking about it, then any number of simple tiny things will jolt it back into memory and I’m off to the races again.  For moments, I really enjoy thinking about her.  Memory of her humor and spark, it brings a warmth to my chest and a grin to my face. But then it rapidly descends into regret/shame/anger, bitter disgust with myself for having ruined such a precious gift -  about 2-4 times a day, every day, I will start thinking about it burst into tears. It’s deeply lodged in my subconscious. Every night when I try to sleep, it’s there. Every morning, as soon as I wake up, it’s right there.

There’s a very loud part of me that feels very clearly that this was the healthiest connection of my life so far, and that it truly had legs to be a fantastic partnership, if only if only I hadn’t deactivated so hard. (Complete fantasy, I know.).  But that part also feels very clearly that it actually still could work - that the pieces were there, we are both still the same people that jived so cleanly for a while - if only I could convince her to give it another go and proved to her that I was truly invested and actively working on my stuff.  One version of the story is that I simply wasn’t ready for a serious relationship two months ago, but that I am now. (A lot has shifted inside me.)

As Hellish as it has been as of late, I have some significant gratitude for the experience.  It has shaken me up in a very permanent way.  I have spent copious time learning about attachment and gained some important clarity on my own roots of insecurity. (i.e. how my somewhat enmeshed relation with my mother and my frequent need to emotionally caretake for her has subconsciously tethered emotional intimacy with danger.) I feel quite confident that I will never push away such good love again without serious attachment considerations and consultation with trusted others. I am committed to healing my attachment wounds and building up a deep reservoir of self-love and self-trust. I’ve taken another Non-Violent Communication course, have been in Somatic Experiencing therapy for 6 weeks now, and I’m going to begin working directly with an attachment-focused therapist upon return to my home state in a few weeks (thumbs down to our proprietary insurance system.). I know I will continue healing and evolving and that things will get better when I am around close friends again instead of isolated in this van. I know that are plenty of other women out there that I can build healthy relationships with and know I am better able to engage in meaningful committed intimacy moving forward.

All of that.. and… as of right now… I simply cannot give up on this one that got away.  This one that I never even really gave an honest try. I know very clearly that there is no path for reconciliation via my own forcing - and I know it is naive and foolish to spend time waiting in my own imagination that she’ll somehow spontaneously see it my way - but.. I’m not sure how to drop it. It feels like I’d be dishonoring the universe / Mother Nature / the blooming flowers / the chirping birds / God / Love itself to just drop it.

It’s like I was riding on a small boat out in the open ocean and a great storm came and washed me overboard, but I’ve tied my arm tightly around a rope and will gladly continue to be dragged through the water.  I’m drowning, but doesn’t even seem possible to let go.  Like, I can consciously try to let go, but I am tied to the damn rope, so… onward we drag..

&#x200B;

My Main Questions:

1. Am I truly being naive / foolish / self-flagellating for hanging on to hope at this point?  (If so, how the heck do I let it go?)
2. Based on how quickly I flipped from avoidant to anxious, does this read more like a FA style to y’all?  (I recognize we humans are more spectrums and so maybe some traits of both showed within this context). I have pushed away plenty of good women.  I have NEVER had this sort of dramatic internal flip from avoiding to anxiously desiring.  Why was this one so different?
3. Aside from Somatic Experiencing work, NVC work, processing it all with an attachment therapist (forthcoming), what the heck else can I do here?  Should I get a dog?  How best to deal with this thick-cut Shame Sandwich of entering my mid-thirties without much of any “serious relationship” experience?
4. Bonus Wondering - I’ve remained on amicable terms with every other woman I’ve ever broken things off with. This is the first time anyone has ever requested no contact from me, and without any potential for future connection as friends. This has been a major factor in my dysregulation. I am haunted by my inability to “fix” what I believe I broke. And I also am simply confused by it - it feels so unnatural to completely throw away the connection. Like.. are we just supposed to pretend that all the good stuff wasn’t there?

391,{FA} deactivation triggers.,"Almost a year ago I F(28) discovered I was an FA, I have been working on my FA tendencies since then. One of my biggest triggers I have discovered is one sided conversation, where one person keeps talking about themselves and the conversation is not mutual.

392,{FA} Indifferent to most people?,"I feel like a good reason I'm so bad at talking to people is because I just don't care for what they have to say. I'm not sure if that's an ADHD thing or if it's an attachment thing. 

It's very rare I feel that kind of ""chemistry"" with anyone in general where I actually feel curious about them and want to hear what they have to say. That's why I haven't bothered to make new friends ever since I had to block the last ones

I just can't sustain the mental effort it takes to get to know someone. Keeping up that facade of pretending to be interested never works long term

I'm not sure if the people who end up wanting to talk to me are actually boring too. I have no clue what sets apart some people from others. But once I DO find that one or two people that I want to talk to, they become the only ones I want to talk to while shutting everyone else out 

This is very frustrating, especially since I'd like to have more people in my life but I can't do it. It's very rare I deactivate with people once I know them (once I know them I can be rather clingy or secure depending on who it is. I'm usually only clinging with romantic partners. Most of my friendships I have or had were secure). 

What happens is I cut them off from the start and never give myself a chance to get to know them or vice versa. It's just immediate irritation like ""ugh, what do they want? Why can't they go away?"". I just feel like I'm too picky choosy with people.

I also noticed that I do actually use the deactivation method a lot of avoidants use. I start judging the ever living life out of other people as an excuse to not get to know them. But it never happens while IN the relationship, it's always judging them right out the gate so they never have a chance to come into my life

393,"""You're so hard to read!"" {fa}","I've been doing some self-reflection lately and realized just how often people tell me this. 

I guess it's really not shocking, but some of the pieces are definitely coming together. 

I find it frustrating because, while I am pretty guarded sometimes (whether on purpose or not, trying to determine if I can trust the person), other times I feel like I'm being very intentionally very enthusiastic/encouraging/whatever for somebody else's sake, and they STILL say this haha. Not just romantically, although that has mostly been a major problem there. I just had a guy very frustrated with me and feeling insecure because he couldn’t “read” me to tell if I was interested. 

But it also happens with casual friends, bosses/coworkers, even relatives... My close friends and family know me and get to see (or perhaps can just recognize) my full range of emotions and tell me they can instantly tell what I'm thinking because of the looks on my face lol. So I know that it's not because I'm never expressive or that I have a flat affect.

So when it comes to new romantic interests or friends or people I'm trying to be professional with, I can't help but think, ""Stop trying to read me then? Can't you just get to know me?""  (Ironically, I have no room to say that because I spend all my free time observing and reading other people but that's not the point right? lol)

Has anyone had similar experiences? If yes, what do you think is happening there? Are people just expecting too much too soon? Or are we actually as hard to read as they think?

I recently (as in, in the past week) discovered I have a fearful avoidant attachment style, and suddenly my issues in past relationships made sooo much sense.

I know I’ve experienced deactivation plenty of times, however I’m having trouble separating the way that feels from things like my depression and anxiety disorders. 

So, how does deactivation feel to you? How can you differentiate between that and depression or anxiety?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: thank you so much for all of your thoughtful replies! It’s seeming more and more to me that my struggles with mental health and my attachment style goes hand in hand most of the time.

399,Feeling secure for the first time {FA},"I know a lot of people have followed my story, but for quick background. I dated my boyfriend for a little over a year. He was the avoidant and I started out as FA/AP and slowly moved towards FA leaning secure/DA. Towards the end of the relationship, he finally said he wanted to really give us a shot and commit. Shortly after he basically ghosted me, and I ended things. 

I started seeing someone else for about 2 months. We went away on a weekend trip, and when my ex found out, he flipped to being more anxious. He came to me and told me that he was ready to commit. We had a lot of long conversations about our relationship past, present, and future. He basically was a completely different person. 

I struggled to decide how to proceed because I was hurt by his actions previously. There were a lot of green flags with the new guy, but also some things that made me hesitate as well. In the end, I decided that the 6 years of history I have with my ex was worth trying for, and I ended things with the new guy. Luckily he was understanding of it all. 

So I have a committed boyfriend now. I asked him to complete the PDS attachment style quiz, which he did (although he was very uncomfortable and tried to quit 2/3 of the way through). He is confirmed to be FA leaning DA, which is what I suspected. Right now he is showing up as very anxious. Our relationship looks completely differently though. 

Before:

* No label and even bringing it up would cause him to deactivate. 
* No one was allowed to know about our relationship (I told my family and a couple of friends, he told no one)
* No talk of the future in any way, including making future plans
* All hangouts were last minute and totally in his control
* We never talked on the phone, barely spoke through text when we weren't together
* Meeting each others' kids and family was out of the question
* Moving in together was out of the question
* Marriage was out of the question
* Conflict resulted in one or both of us shutting down and avoiding

Now:

* We openly call each other boyfriend and girlfriend
* He has told him mom about me
* We talk about the future almost daily. We have multiple times made plans to hang out in the future, and he frequently asks me early in the day if I want to come over instead of only last minute/late at night
* We talk on the phone daily, sometimes multiple times. We also text throughout the day, although not constantly which is perfect
* I have come around his son multiple times. We have hung out with all of our kids together twice now (it's only been about a month) and have discussed doing something together every weekend or more
* I'm building a house which he has come with me to see the progress. We have many talks about moving in together and what that would look like, and we both agree that's the goal. It's just a matter of figuring out the timing and doing it in a transitional way vs all at once.
* We've talked about marriage multiple times, and he has said it's inevitable. I honestly think as soon as we no longer work together, he will make more serious moves to make this happen. 
* We actually talk through conflicts, resolve them, and move on. There are still times where I want to shut down and run, but he helps me to fight that urge and work through it so that we can talk in a healthy way. 

It's funny because we're both FA, and for the first part of our relationship he was very much the avoidant and I was the anxious one. Now I feel the roles have reversed. The thought of doing all of these real relationship things scares me. I discussed in therapy how if I'm going to have another relationship with anyone, I'm going to take everything I've learned over the last year and actually try. Try in a way I didn't with any other relationship; in my eyes I think that means honoring myself more as well as trying to use healthy behaviors. The problem with that is that it means I have to face all these long buried things that I have been avoiding and it scares me. 

It scares me to think of letting someone live with me and see how I'm messy. See how I get overwhelmed and emotionally dysregulated easily. How it takes a lot of effort to function (although this is also partly due to my autism I think, which is something new to me and also scary to think about letting someone see). There's still a part of me that feels not good enough or like if he sees the real me he might leave.

But an even bigger part of me feels secure in this as time goes on. I'm finding that I don't question whether he's committed, because I believe down to my core he is. I don't find myself questioning whether I'm committed, because I feel down to my core I am. I'm able to recognize my deactivation sooner and work through it in a way I never have before. And the more conversations we have about all kinds of things, the more comfortable I am communicating my needs, thoughts, wants, frustrations, etc. I used to think it was better to avoid conflict by not speaking up, but now I feel like I'm not afraid to say something he might not like, because he has given me a safety net of talking through things instead of blowing up. Of validating me and hearing me, of following through. 

For the first time in my life, I trust a man in a relationship. I trust that he won't lay his hands on me, or yell at me. I trust that if he gets upset with me, that he will communicate and we'll work through it together. I trust that if he says something, he's going to follow through on it. I trust that he is also working through his shit so that he can be better. 

And more importantly, I trust myself in a relationship. I trust that I will not put up with things I don't like because I'm afraid or avoiding. I trust that I'm allowed to take up space. I trust that if it's no longer working for me, I will be able to walk away instead of staying longer than I should. I trust that I have made a good decision for myself and my kids. 

The avoidance is still there, for sure. And even some of the anxiety. But right now it feels the annoying buzz of a mosquito instead of an overpowering roar that drowns out all reason. And I'm excited to see where this goes.",ujnfqw,33,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ujnfqw/feeling_secure_for_the_first_time_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
400,I {SA} think I am having a deactivation moment. I have never had this happen so I hope to get some clarity,"Hey guys! This is my first ever post in this sub. I previously identified as AP, but long hours of therapy during the past 4 years + healthy dating patterns has finally landed me in the secure spectrum. 

I am currently dating a man (past 3-4 months). And today I am having a feeling of wanting to leave my partner. He is AP and has the last 2 weeks experienced some internal turmoil regarding our relationship. He pushed me away, pulled me back in and then he punished me for basically standing on the side-lines as he did his emotional gymnastics. After he came back to the ground I felt like he became an insecure partner. I have been trying to support him, but today we went through another set of protest behaviors and I felt myself wanting to leave the relationship altogether. 

So I’m asking if this is deactivation: 
I am viewing him in a very negative light. I have forgotten the reason I feel in love with him and why I liked him to begin with. I see no future with him and no motivation to fix the issue anymore. I feel like he isn’t a safe person anymore, and I don’t wanna hang out with him. I can’t get myself to return his calls or texts. I want to fix it, but I just have no motivation to do so. The things that stands out for me the most is the way I see him. He used to be this amazing, safe person, and now I can’t remember what made me attracted to him. In my eyes he is suddenly a mean and unsafe person. I can’t remember a single good thing about him.",udsyan,30,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/udsyan/i_sa_think_i_am_having_a_deactivation_moment_i/,AvoidantAttachment,0
401,{DA} Sharing my story of AT discovery and hopefully will encourage other DAs change is possible.,"DA here.
Allow me to be vulnerable and try to summarize a big story as short as I can. I've been sharing similar texts of my story around Reddit/YT as a way to be seen, to share with others that your journey doesn't end here. To share with other DAs that we can change. To share with APs that us DAs can change, and that we do feel love.

I'm a 32yo DA and was dating a 23yo AP. Dated 18 months, lived together about 15 of them. Known her since she was 16 via best friend's little sister. Relationship started (hooking up) late June 2020, ended for good January 21st, 2022.

She was ""raised"" in broken home, by an alcoholic father, no mother figure. Has alcoholism tendencies, has smoked pot since early teens and has used it daily, and constantly for years as a coping mechanism. Anytime something is wrong, pot is the cure, immediately.

Now, she's shown me more love than I've ever seen but after 4 or 5 months I slowly started withdraw a bit. And it snowballed. I won't get into specifics but usually I ""dump 'em and forget 'em"". Well after a little over 13 months I dumped her back to back within like 24 hours. She moved out got a 6 month lease etc.

But it didn't feel right. I couldn't just forget. We kept contacting. But it was getting painful for her Because I was wishy washy because although I craved her, I also wanted to be alone as a DA. We were gonna meet one day late September to have a serious talk. My younger cousin died unexpectedly on vacation and I told her I couldn't meet but not why, then blew up on her and told her when she was upset because I didn't tell her why.

We hung out when I got back into town from that ordeal and I cried and cried to her. And we discussed us...and she recommended a book (Attached) that a mutual friend told her about. She had already ordered it. So I ordered it just kinda to impress her.

As soon as I read just the back I got goosebumps. It was scary. I read it in 5 days. I highlighted passages etc, I made notes, I cried. I sent her stuff but she kinda didn't wanna talk again because she said she wanted space.

My work pays for 9 three therapy sessions, I did the work and found a therapist (albeit 3 hours away as I live in a rural area). And she's on her dad's insurance, so she could do her own. So I wrote down everything for her step to step. She never did go, but I had my first session October 25th. She came over that night. I read so many passages from Attached and Daring Greatly. I bawled and bawled. I talked about therapy. It was the most vulnerable moment of my entire life.

So instantly (and foolishly really) we reconnect. Have sex that night, and she just moves back in for tbe most part. Most of her things and she just never leaves.

Quick backstory, I've been blind in an eye since I was 17, but have had no issues. Well, wouldn't you know it, two weeks after that, my blind eye and head are incredibly painful. Constant pain.....then my good eye gets photophobia and becomes sensitive to light. And it worsens and worsens. I did one more trip to therapy and she came with (not to the session), and she had to drive us back because headlights bothered me too much. 

My condition worsened...and can you guess what also slowly started to happen? ....yeah, I went to my safety net. I was scared, miserable, in pain, and lost as to what was going on. I didn't wanna talk about it. I couldn't really do much. I couldn't drive to therapy anymore and she wanted me to Zoom and I said it wouldn't be effective. Which ANY therapy is better than none. I had once again become complacent in my Avoidance. 

Fast forward next month just before Christmas things with us are just as bad as before therapy etc. She gets drunk and totals her car but doesn't get a DUI. And less than a week later she's drinking again. And also 4 days after the accident she straight face tells me she will continue to drive stoned regardless because it ""doesn't affect her that way"" (Like I said she has substance abuse issues) that caused a lot of problems for me. We've been through a LOT with her drinking issues over the entirety of the relationship. 

Two weeks later on January 10th my blind eye gets removed and my good eye is finally corrected. It was so bad I couldn't drive to work with polarized sunglasses on 2 days before the surgery. In freaking January. 

6 or 7 days later she's crying first thing in the morning and says she's overwhelmed and I asked why, and I mentioned she didn't get a DUI (which she should have), didn't get hurt or hurt anyone, was getting back $3,500 more for her totalled car than she paid, my buddy was covering legal representation for free etc. And she said because she still feels like a fuck up. And I EXPLODED. I said then why the fuck are you still drinking and getting fucked up? And we went back and forth and she said how I am my old way again and it can't work that way..which I do agree. I was going through shit and I said it was temporary, but who knows. But I also brought that she never did therapy, she only even tried to call a therapist once. And she never read Attached. Got the book before me, I read it in 5 days. She had it for 3+ months and never read the first full page. That does not encourage me to get better.

Needless to say,  11 days after surgery, I dumped her. She was depressed that day (at her apartment because she had to work which is a town over, and she'sa bartender coincidentally) and kept saying she needs to get better and can't keep doing what she's doing. And I tried to be encouraging, but she's in this cycle. Even if I fixed myself, it is apparent she (again only 23 though) is not ready to do the work for herself and love herself, to kick bad coping mechanisms. We just can't work at this point in time.

I left her a very long thoughtful letter and said I'd always be there but feel that I'm unable to help her etc. But just a breakup letter because I felt like it would spare her pain. I think that was wrong of me, she just felt more abandoned I'm sure. That was Jan 21st.

She's never spoken to me since. She blocked me 9 days later. She started sleeping with someone else 6 or 7 days later and moved in with him like 12 days later.

My insecure self wants to feel anger....but I don't. I feel resentment for myself. I feel sadness for her, because she is not getting better and only covering her pain. (She's a serial rebounder. I was a literally a one day later rebound from a previous 2 year relationship of hers, and she did nearly the same thing before that)

I'm proud to say however, I've been reading a ton more literature. I've lurked all over the internet to read people's experiences they've shared. I've started Cognitive Behavioural Therapy April 11th only 20 miles away. I've gone 3 times already and have all of March scheduled. I've been eating right, excercising, writing a daily journal, have been more open with friend, family and work family. Shared an incredible vulnerable FB post owning up to my toxicity and my faults to my community to be see, lightly explained attachment theory and how for me continuing as an DA is unacceptable. 

I am making the painful journey to SA a day at time. And I WILL be Secure. There is no doubt in my mind. It is happening, and all the relationships in my life be they romantic, family, friendship, casual, will all be fulfilling and full. I know I can do this. 

So remember this long text. Any of us can change. But it can't be forced. It comes from within. And me? Yeah, I want it.

402,How to know if I'm just uninterested or deactivating?,"Hi there!

I'm 26M I believe FA but I'm not sure, maybe just AA. When I'm with avoidant people I feel SO strongly and get obsessed and anxious feeling to a crazy level. But any time I've been with someone that reciprocates affection I have lost attraction. But what I am unsure about is: have I just never met someone secure who is a good match or am I deactivating every time I meet someone secure?

I sometimes will meet someone secure and enjoy it for a while but after a few dates I start to feel very guilty being around them because they clearly like me more than I do. Often I *want* to like them but I just can't. I wouldn't say I feel suffocated or scared of commitment or anything like that, I just don't really want to be around them anymore.

**What I'm trying to understand is** how do I know the difference between simply not being interested in someone because we are not a match or if I'm unconsciously deactivating and avoiding a great thing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I really want to have a secure life partner who I can make happy.",semv0d,32,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/semv0d/how_to_know_if_im_just_uninterested_or/,AvoidantAttachment,0
403,Regret After Deactivating for Months,"Perhaps this is a story as old as time. 

I broke up with a girl that was very anxiously attached to me. I was not aware that I had an avoidant attachment style, deactivated, broke up with her and continued on with my life as if nothing had even happened. 

She reaches out four months later and asks to meet up. I ignored her for the previous four months but I finally agreed. Big mistake. All of a sudden I was scared of losing her. Roles reversed, and she became avoidant and wanted space to think about what she wants. 

But is it normal to deactivate for this long!? It was literally months! 

Also, do those with anxious attachmnent styles that lean more secure empathize with this fear of abandonment? Because if I were her, I'd be seriously confused as to how I could have done a 180.

410,it's the medium sized boundaries that are the hardest {fa},"Boundaries are the key to all of my relationship struggles.

It's taken too long, but I am finally working with a therapist with the intent of working on my unhelpful core beliefs.

Many of which (I understand now) stem from having dysfunctional boundaries. 

In the past I have had two modes with how I enact boundaries and deal with my emotions regarding other people.

A. Say nothing. Tell myself I'm over reacting that I shouldn't feel the way that I do, stuff it down. Everything is fine.

B. Feel justified in feeling really bad/overwhelmed/scared. Decide person is unsafe and I cut them off.

However in reality, there only really is ""B""

""A"" always eventually turns into ""B"" because telling myself things don't bother me actually doesn't work in the long term. 

It just prolongs the inevitable cut off once too many resentments have built up.

So this time I am trying something different, and I am very nervous.


A friend of mine did something I really didn't like. 

I am proud of myself for how I reacted in the moment. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and preserved the relationship.

But now the hard part. Not pretending nothing happened and everything is fine. 

I felt quite hurt, and although I know they didn't do it on purpose, I know that I need to say something.

I'm thinking it should go something like ""hey I know it was a mistake, but it really felt shitty so please be more careful in the future"" 

I dunno, am I doing this right? I feel like a consequence should be in there somewhere, but I want it to be an appropriate size for the incident.

It feels silly that this is so hard.",vcghv6,32,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vcghv6/its_the_medium_sized_boundaries_that_are_the/,AvoidantAttachment,0
411,{da} Discovered one of the reasons why I’m avoidant,"So my mother casually dropped something in conversation today. When I was around 4-5 years old she had a very busy job, so she left me and my sister at home with a maid to care of us. Apparently that maid neglected the shit out of me, she would make me walk home from the bus stop alone every day, would send me ALONE to buy cigarettes for her from a nearby shop, etc. My mom would only be able to come from office by 7:30 in the evening after which she apparently used to yell at me and hit me a lot while I was doing my homework. And I was only 5!! My dad also had a hectic job and he would reach home by 2 am. My mom says they only realised what the maid was doing after 6 months, and she says she feels so bad that I had to endure that when I was young. And that she regrets hitting and yelling. She said I was really traumatised as a child after that period in my life. 

Look I don’t blame my parents, they come from a generation where hitting their kids was normal, but seriously wtf. 

I can see now why safety for me equals alone time. And why conflict in relationships is very triggering for me, and makes me want to run away. Why I find it hard to communicate when there is conflict happening. Why I pull away in relationships as soon as I feel unsafe. And why I repress my emotions sometimes. Why interdependence doesn’t come easily and independence seems safer. I’m guessing there was some level of emotional neglect in my childhood. 

How many more such childhood memories must I have repressed where I was neglected, or yelled at, or hit by my mother or someone else close to me? 

Can anyone else relate?

I can’t imagine ever coming home and hitting my child after they haven’t seen me all day. Ugh.",v0ylo3,32,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/v0ylo3/da_discovered_one_of_the_reasons_why_im_avoidant/,AvoidantAttachment,0
412,Co-regulation during times of distress {FA},"I've always felt like my boyfriend and I do a good job of moving through our intense moments (not really an argument, not really a fight, more of a miscommunication made worse by intense emotions). We communicate, and can bring it around somewhat quickly for the most part. But us both being FA, it feels like things have been coming up more lately as we work on navigating this new relationship dynamic. 

I recently realized that it seems our intense moments seem to line up with when one or both of us is dysregulated emotionally. Sometimes it's because of each other, sometimes it's because of life outside of our relationship and we direct it at each other. When we're dysregulated, our insecurities and unhealthy coping skills rear their ugly heads. 

He is at a place in his healing journey where he's just starting to actually feel his emotions. Where before he would have an emotion come up and he would deny it, suppress it. Now he is allowing himself to feel them, but it is overwhelming for him because he's not used to it. I'm at a place where I've allowed myself to feel my emotions, and I'm better at naming them, but it's really hard for me to process and communicate what I need in real time. So not only are we at different places, but we're just triggering each other. 

Over the last few months I've seen a few videos online about co-regulation. Pre break up I had wanted to try this with him, but was too insecure at that point to ask. I came across it again after one of our intense moments and I mustered up the courage to ask if we could try it. The technique that most appealed to me was sitting facing each other, my legs over his so we could be as physically close as possible, and holding each other with foreheads touching. There are some similar ones that require eye contact, which makes me super uncomfortable so I thought this would be a better place to start. He willingly agreed, and is even the one who suggested we try it once in person. 

We've done it 3 times, not necessarily in intense moments but more as a way to connect. And I can't begin to tell you how beneficial it was. I think it helped me see that I live my life in a constant state of dysregulation, it's just a matter of intensity. Being close to him like that helped me to feel grounded, calm, relaxed in a way that I don't normally feel. And I actually spent almost the entire next day sleeping; I truly feel like co-regulating with him in this way multiple times in a row (we did 3 total over the course of 12 hours) helped pull me out of fight/flight and I could finally rest. 

We both agreed that this is something we want to try when we feel those intense moments starting. I told him I can't always communicate exactly what's wrong, but I can communicate that I'm dysregulated. And maybe a co-regulation exercise in that moment would help me think clearly enough to communicate without the intense emotions. We're going to try it, and I look forward to it. 

I wanted to share another tool that others might find helpful in navigating their relationships as we try to find security. This excerpt from an article (link below) gives a bit of information. I also have seen in my research that co-regulation comes before self-regulation. Co-regulation is the groundwork for learning to self-regulate, and I think that's absolutely true. 

 ""Here is the list of common co-regulation behaviors that you can add to your repertoire:

* Light touch
* Rubbing your partner
* Putting an arm around your partner
* Massage
* Making and maintaining eye contact
* Using a soothing voice
* Audibly sighing in relief
* Leaning on one another

In order to best implement these co-regulatory behaviors, follow these three steps:

1. Notice – Stop what you’re doing. Become aware of your own body. Notice how distressed you feel and how it is affecting the way you approach your partner.
2. Pause — Pausing allows for slower, more deliberate decision-making. Take a short pause, close your eyes, and breathe. It is perfectly fine for your partner to look at you like you’re crazy.
3. Engage Physically — Make the deliberate effort to move toward your partner and engage them physically with a touch, embrace, or eye contact if that is all that can be tolerated.  You may choose to do this after a time-out, depending on how escalated the argument has become. Your goal here is not to “fix” anything, but to increase the felt sense of safety.""

But the thing that terrifies me the most is my belief that this is an objective and unquestionable truth

414,{FA} Everything is fine—until it's not.,"Honestly. Truly.

I am currently in a relationship and, as always, I am finding it extremely difficult not to self-implode whenever I feel even the smallest hint of dissatisfaction. I wither away at the very sense of conflict... but it all seems to be in my head.

The tiniest remark is all it takes to rub me the wrong way and send me running for the hills. Given, it's a very, very slow run; it's a run, nonetheless.

My issue is: everything is so reactive that it leaves me just as perplexed as my partner. I cannot pinpoint whether there is an actual problem or I am attempting to wiggle my way out of some sort of intimacy.

Typically, I think this tends to happen a day or two after we connect fairly well. No issues, no drama. Easy affection, closeness—everything a relationship should be.

We'll be fine. Everything will be fine until, well, something is said in passing that I can contort into criticism of myself or my actions and then I get resentful. Which then causes me to criticize my partner (internally), resulting in me brooding over the entire relationship.

415,Don't know where to go from here - fighting deactivation,"I was at my boyfriend's last night, and told him that we're going to come to a point in our relationship where I want more of an emotional connection and he'll need to decide whether he's willing to do that, or willing to let me walk away. 

He said he was afraid of that point, because he thinks he'll just say no and walk away. That he's fine on his own, and is independent. That him being independent has no correlation to how he feels about me. I told him it kind of does - that he doesn't let me in because he thinks he needs to be independent, and that I think that came from him not having anyone reliable in his life. He said he truly just doesn't care. I asked why we were still together after a year if he didn't care. ""If there was a nuclear explosion, and my and my son woke up and were the only survivors, I know we'd be fine. I would deal with it. But I would miss you."" 

He told me he thinks I have surpassed him - that I've worked on trauma from my past and I'm ready for a bigger emotional connection and that's something that he ""can't and will not"" give me. I asked why he won't, and he said that was a story for another time. 

I feel like in the moment, I handled things securely. Because that really hurt to hear from the person I love. But no crying, no protest behavior, and only a mild deactivation. I tried to leave later after he started to get physical (wanting to initiate sex) and I just knew I couldn't do it. I told him I couldn't pretend that what he said didn't hurt, and that I wasn't mad at him but I couldn't stay. He practically begged me to stay, became very clingy (pulling me as close as possible and holding me tightly like he was afraid I would leave). He told me he loved me in the most emotion filled way I've ever heard him say it, and said ""You know I can't help it, right?"" 

I know. I know he can't help it. I know this is his own avoidance and he's definitely not as self aware as I am. I can imagine how anxious he must feel in his body during this whole exchange. I remember feeling like that - not knowing why I felt that way or how to fix it, but knowing that something felt wrong. It's not a fun place to be. 

And since then, I'm starting to deactivate as well. I want time to process what he's said. To decide if I should take him at face value, or stay and hope that with time and patience he'll be able to give me that connection. Even having the conversation and him voicing this was more than I've gotten from him before. Any talk of our relationship he used to shut down immediately. I want to take time, and the secure part of me knows I should communicate this to him. But the avoidant part of me wants to just ghost. Beat him to the punch and end things before he can. 

At the same time, I know that he's opened up to me and if I just disappear then that's like punishing him. It's like telling him it was wrong to be honest about his feelings. And I don't want that either. So now I'm stuck in this stupid freeze deactivation state where I just don't know what to do. As soon as I saw him this morning I avoided eye contact and looked down. He said good morning and I couldn't say anything and just kept walking. 

The silver lining is I can see my own growth in this interaction. 6 months ago I would have broken down and tried to run the second those words left his mouth. I would have taken it personally, believing I wasn't good enough. But I know it's not about me - it's about him. I also know it's not something I can help him with - he has to want to work on it on his own, and right now it doesn't sound like he wants to. Now I have to decide what that means for me. 

I feel like this is a side of becoming more secure that isn't talked about enough. When you become more secure, you may have to leave behind people that aren't ready to do the same.",s28m4f,31,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s28m4f/dont_know_where_to_go_from_here_fighting/,AvoidantAttachment,0

More and more I see the hallmark of particularly the disorganized/FA attachment as way too much control as well as responsibility.

In my last therapy session I started to pontificate and wonder about what actions might be required as a result of the feelings I'm having. I need to set a boundary, right? Or have a conversation. Or apologize. Or express a need. Or pull some energy out. Or remove myself completely. Or maybe just analyze or journal to ""get to the bottom"" of why I'm feeling this way, the origins of it.

My therapist interrupted me, an extremely rare occasion, and said she sees a real opportunity for me here. To just feel the discomfort and do nothing at all about it.

It's rare I get kind of stopped dead in therapy, or hit by a truth I hadn't already acknowledged. But damn. I knew it as truth as soon as she said it.

After an exceedingly difficult conversation with my potential partner the other day I paused a long time. I noticed all my impulses to compulsively gather more information, to find some kind of limit or structure or proposal to put forth...

420,"WTF does ""you're intimidating"" even mean?? {FA} {DA}","In the last week, three men have told me I intimidate them. 

1. *You* ***intimidate*** *me.* 
2. *You're very* ***intimidating****!*
3. *I'm* ***intimidated*** *by you.* 

Are these statements really meant to be taken as compliments? Is it necessarily a good thing to ""intimidate"" others? 

When I've felt intimidated by people, it's been when I've felt scared of incurring their wrath, disapproval, or distain. 

The only time I can recall feeling nervous simply because someone was so amazing was when I was speaking with Martin Amis. ...And that was Martin Fucking Amis (RIP). I'd have never *told* him he intimidated me. I knew the best thing to do was to project respectful nonchalance, lest he make some blistering comment and I'd have wished to sink into the earth. 

In a romantic context, being called ""intimidating"" makes me think people feel I'm dangerous, judgmental, or have bad intent. It pokes at my shame wound: *Even when I try to be good, I am bad / I am cold / my mere existence hurts others / people are better off without me / people sense they should stay away.* 

I'd be happy never to be called intimidating again. It's not flattering to know someone is having an unpleasant experience in my company. I just want to be enjoyed, cherished. 

What is there to do to counter this? Is there a better way to understand what the word is supposed to mean? What're your experiences of being intimidated by others?

422,Private Sub for {DA},"
I created a new group a little while ago. 
r/The_DA_Space in response to the desire to have a private space where we can discuss our own DA attachment style in peace. 

The group is private, meaning only approved users can see the content. Please send a join request, a DM, or comment below for an invitation. 

Group members should:

- Have a DA attachment style or DA leaning attachment style 

- Have an established account (I’m sorry, no new accounts please - I wish to keep this a safe and private DA only space)

- Understand this is a space to primarily talk about our own attachment style, learn or practice vulnerability, seek support, and feel OK being DA in a smaller and private group setting with others who truly get us

- Not expect a space for basic relationship advice, posts re: specific relationships must be related to your own avoidant tendencies within the relationship 

- Be okay with any kind of venting and label the post as such 

- Wish to respect other members’ privacy. Even though Reddit can be very anonymous, I’d like private group members to feel safe to open up without worrying about backlash or someone posting about private posts in other groups. 

- Understand that the group is a bunch of DAs, and if you want other/outside perspectives, please feel free to post on any of the various AT subs out there.",10rrnw2,30,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/10rrnw2/private_sub_for_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
423,{FA} Experiencing the other side of the coin and absolutely hating it. What do I do?,"So I (25F) have been single for almost two months and have been talking to someone (24M) who seems to be secure for about a month. I don't think I've ever been this confused in my life. I've been incredibly anxious before in my relationship with my ex, who was a DA. Now, with this new guy I'm talking to who ticks off all my boxes and gives me what I've always said I wanted (undivided attention, texting daily, emotionally available, an idea of what he wants in the future, kind, funny, sweet etc etc).. I'm not feeling a single thing. Granted, we did only have one date (which was about 4hrs of us going for a drink, going to a restaurant and a ride around town) but I found myself kind of trying to nitpick stuff I didn't like about him physically. I don't find him unattractive at all, but I guess I'm waiting for ""more"" to see if he's worth all my effort, time and reciprocation. Although I don't know what ""more"" should entail.

Mind you, with my DA ex, there was an intensity that I can't even describe. My whole world revolved around him, but I found out I was very codependent in that relationship as well. I craved emotional intimacy so bad (at least, so I thought) and never got it. Everything about it was so unhealthy because we kept on triggering each other, ending up in this push and pull cycle. But man, the highs felt so good and were so intense. Now that all of those intense feelings have disappeared - both the good and the bad - it's like I forgot what it's like to date someone that doesn't have this attachment style. 

Currently with this guy I'm dating, I feel like everything is going too fast as well - why dedicate so much time and effort to someone you don't even know that well? What if he finds out I'm not even that great? Or what if he has created this idealistic version of me in his mind that I now have to live up to or else he'll leave? I sometimes even get annoyed when he texts me, not exactly knowing why. And if I look back in my journal, I've written qualities I want in a partner & he embodies almost all of them. Yet in reality, I can't seem to muster up any feelings for him and am just left confused by it all. I hope someone can make sense of what I'm saying because even I myself can't truly follow the trail of my thoughts anymore. Hope anyone has experienced the same. This disorganized attachment truly feels like a mess sometimes. 

TLDR; FA who's been anxious before in relationship with DA, now dating someone who seems secure but can't seem to feel anything for him, gets annoyed by all his efforts and is confused as to what's going on.",10kxci3,30,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/10kxci3/fa_experiencing_the_other_side_of_the_coin_and/,AvoidantAttachment,0
424,Constantly missing others {DA},"I have been searching on the internet about attachment styles and I can’t quite know what my attachment style is. I find myself constantly missing people in my life and having attachment that isn’t reciprocated. Both in love and friendship. Whenever I notice that my attachment isn’t reciprocated, I immediately pull away. Because I’m tired of feeling that rejection. But at the same time I am sick of living like this. Of always being stoic, of working on myself, of never relying on anything. Always self-containing, restrictive, emotionally intense. 


My two experiences in love were like this. I find myself falling in love quickly. I view myself positively but view others negatively. They always disappoint me. I wish I knew how my mind works and why is it that I attach myself to people like that? How can I simply state what I want and when I see that it isn’t reciprocated move on? That’s what secure attachment is about, isn’t it? But it’s always in the back of my mind. I’m sick of this. I really wanna be independent at my core, but it’s been so many disappointments that I wish I could open up to somebody or at least have someone to support me. 


I feel a lot of coldness and indifference from the outside. I find it hard to express my feelings sometimes because they’re so intense.

If I’m being honest with myself, I constantly am having feelings of not being understood, of people’s coldness and indifference causing me to feel isolated. Like a part of me doesn’t want to accept that despite the fact that I fell in love, both of the girls (in those cases) never felt the same and simply pulled away. It feels so bad. I never reached out and have kept it all to myself but I’m tired of this trauma inside me. I wish I could simply state my needs and move on. If it’s reciprocated, then great; if it’s not, then move on with my life. What do I do? I’ve tried to make these past attachments work and they don’t. How can I stop missing people?

426,"Extremely avoidant before and after sex, how to break through? {FA}","I notice that during sex I detach - i completely shut down emotionally because intimacy is too hard to face. When it’s over, if there’s no emotional connection, I want to leave immediately and never see them again (flirting with someone I’m not emotionally into is so cringe to me). If they are actually into me, I feel guilty already as if I’m going to disappoint them. I feel like they expect a relationship right away and I feel suffocated and uncomfortable. As a result, my hookups have only been 1-2 times max with the same person. If I’ve caught feelings and the other person hasn’t, I feel so used and vulnerable that I can’t even have sex with them anymore. 

Recently, my hookups have been in situations where I knew there was no outcome (pressure) of being together, but I still really enjoyed them. Loved hanging out, genuine conversation, great sex. But once we left, if there was no desire to pursue me or validate that it was reciprocal, I feel so rejected that I can’t imagine ever having sex again with them. Lack of interaction outside of sex has always made me feel used if we clicked before. 

How in the world do I get past this?

427,Trying to be Vulnerable + Seeking Advice {da},"I'm 21 (F). I've never been in a relationship, but I have been in several situations where I've liked them romantically until they liked me back and then I proceeded to distance myself and remove them from my life because I felt suffocated and grossed out by the idea of being in a relationship. 

I've been very aware of this trend in my relationships and have actively been trying to break out of it, but it feels impossible. Every time someone new comes along, I always tell myself that ""this time will be different - I won't run away when it gets serious,"" but like always, it ends up the same way. 

I'm fortunate enough to be in therapy and have had conversations about this for a while. The consensus is that I need to be able to be vulnerable and comfortable with that. I feel a lil bamboozled because my whole life, I've always thought of myself as someone who was very in tune with my emotions and could have very deep conversations with others. Apparently, that isn't ""vulnerable"" is. With the help of my therapist, I've come to realize that my avoidant attachment style exists outside of relationships. Anytime there is a difficult problem, emotion, or situation, I always shut it out so I can continue to exist undisturbed. I'm trying to break out of this pattern, but I can't seem to. More like, I don't want to. I'm scared that once I start letting myself feel everything, I'll never be able to stop. And the idea of that is so terrifying to me. 

In 2021, I began texting this guy, and we were friends until May 2022. We texted every day, and I knew I had developed very strong feelings for him. But, as usual, when I got the feeling he liked me back, I started to distance myself (I would take weeks to respond to him etc.). Around April, he even told me how he felt, but it was too late, I was so over it. By May, we stopped talking and haven't spoken since. Initially, I was really relieved. But fast forward to now (November), and I really regret it. All i want to do is text him and have him in my life again. I can't though. I can't intentionally reinsert myself into his life, only to probably do the same thing again. It sucks because It's like I can't trust myself anymore. I feel like a grenade in romantic relationships, because everywhere I go, I just ruin the other person's life. I don't know what to do. 

In an effort to be more vulnerable with myself, I keep telling myself that I just need to accept the fact that I've lost him and that for the foreseeable future, I'm just going to be sad. But i don't want to feel sad. It sucks. I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of tears. What do I do? 

I can't explain this to anyone because they don't understand what it's like. 

Please tell me what to do. Do I reach out and risk going through the whole thing again? Do i leave him alone and just sit with the sadness?",yp9a4u,30,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/yp9a4u/trying_to_be_vulnerable_seeking_advice_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
428,Guilt/Shame after deciding that things aren’t working for me/ that I want to move on {fa},"Hi there. So a few weeks ago I posted here about wanting to definitively end things with my DA/FA ex because I felt that his attempts at reconciling with me weren’t really working for me. We had been dating for a while. In the end I felt taken for granted and the push-pull was just feeling more and more toxic. 

We had planned to meet up that weekend, and I was planning on having a talk with him about my decision and ending things respectfully. But that didn’t end up happening. He had chosen the day and wanted to do something together but he never messaged to say couldn’t make it or reschedule. And never messaged to apologize for not showing up. Till today my last message to him agreeing to meet has still been left on delivered. 

I was quite angry at that. But then I decided that this is the last straw and I didn’t deserve to be treated like this. I drafted a message that I wanted to send to end things. But I didn’t end up sending it, because in the end I was tired of always being the grown up and mature one in the situation. And I felt like I had tried my best. 

But now I have some days where I feel so guilty for leaving or so much shame for not waiting for him because in the end of the day he could just be having a hard time. I feel like I abandoned him even though I know that’s not the factual case. And then I feel guilty cause then I think it’s my fault that things didn’t work out, that he’s mad at me for doing something and that I’m such a fuck up. Then I go through days of not feeling anything and being so sure at my core that he was not treating me right and I didn’t deserve this. Then I go to “was it really that bad or was I just being harsh/ or were my standards too high?” 

Is this normal? I kind of really just want to be over it and not think about it anymore. But I’m so curious if it’s an FA thing to feel this much guilt and shame even after choosing to leave yourself?? I felt so free after I made the decision but now it’s like I’m second guessing myself.

They're both addressing commitment-phobia, the pain of never committing, the benefits of committing, and the importance of committing —in several aspects of life—to having a life that feels even remotely fulfilling. I gotta say I'm fully on board—particularly because I'm not in my 20's anymore, where not committing is usually okay and arguably beneficial.

435,"Interesting, wonderful date {da}","A long-stood friend of mine finally confessed her feelings to me a few days ago, and I'd previously already decided to myself that if she did, I'd reciprocate. Cue feeling *unbelievably* anxious and filled with self-doubt for the next 3 days. Could barely sleep, felt like throwing up constantly.

Then we have a date. We spend the entire 12ish hours together just giddy, ridiculously sighing and doing almost nothing but just being there. Amazing butterflies, incredible feeling of deep affection throughout. Sweet nothings for hours upon hours. We were so in tune with each other- I don't think I'd ever felt that kind of warmth for someone else before.

At the end, I suddenly within a couple minutes shut down and I tell her (I'm working on being very honest with her so we have healthy boundaries) that I'm starting to be out of social energy which makes me a little reserved, and I'm ready to sleep, and thank her for the great date.

Now, once again, filled with doubts and excuses and reasons for why my affection is lesser than hers and how I'm faking it etc etc.

It's extremely interesting how this happens, especially now that I *know* it's just my avoidant side speaking, that this anxiety shuts me down completely, and I just need to communicate this clearly with her, and let her know that I'm taking a bit of time to recover etc. She's super great, I really, really hope I don't mess this up.

I like her a lot, even if I can't feel it so well right now. The date is incontrovertible *proof* of it.",tyta10,31,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tyta10/interesting_wonderful_date_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
436,"I have an avoidant attachment, but it's not my identity {FA}","With the recent thread about the anxious sub, and the carry over from that in the main sub, I'm starting to have some frustrations again with attachment theory. It seems to me that people take attachment theory, and their attachment style, and almost make it their whole identity or their partner's/ex's whole identity. So I want to challenge that belief and possibly make people think about other reasons someone could be displaying avoidant behavior. 

1. I'm female. I have a period, and my hormones are frequently out of whack for the week before, during, and sometimes after. That's 3 weeks a month. This can cause irritability, isolation, shut downs, anger, passive aggression, etc. 
2. I'm a single mom. I might not let you get close to me because I have 4 kids to think about and protect and I need to know that you can be consistent and stable if you're going to be a long term part of our lives. 
3. I have depression, anxiety, and CPTSD. I have been through years and years of trauma starting with my own parents. I do not know how to trust people. And yes, this is partially why I have an avoidant attachment style to begin with, but there's so much more to it. I have been verbally, emotionally, and physically abused by multiple romantic partners and even some employers. My sense of self has been dragged down to the depths of hell by other people, and literally anyone in that situation would be guarded. 
4. I'm on the autism spectrum. I literally do not think or function the way a lot of people do. I struggle to read social cues. I struggle to connect with others and maintain those connections long term. I don't pick up on subtleties which is how a lot of people operate; they want you to mind read and they want to imply things instead of directly communicating. If you don't tell me I'm doing something wrong, odds are I think everything is fine. 

At the end of the day, people are not just their attachment style. I've been with an FA who was a total narcissistic douche bag. I've been with an FA who was an abusive alcoholic. I've been with an FA who was loving and caring but who couldn't get past his own self worth issues to make things work. My dad is a DA who does really well with friends and family, but struggles with romantic relationships and his kids. 

Attachment styles affect as all differently, and it's a spectrum. It's not possible to generalize avoidants or APs or even secures. Anyone can display behaviors from all three. But that's all they are. They are behaviors. Insecure behaviors and coping mechanisms that have been used to survive. They are not disorders (unless on the very extreme end). They are not your identity, or your partner's identity. 

Attachment theory is meant to be a road map to understanding  yourself. Is it helpful to know other people's attachment styles? Sure. But it shouldn't be used as a way to justify their actions, or your own. It shouldn't be used as a way to weed people out of your life. And it shouldn't be the only factor considered when deciding whether to be with someone. 

All avoidant, anxious and secure really mean is that's how you connect to others. I'm avoidant so I'm more likely to put myself above others. I'm anxious so I'm more likely to put others above myself. I'm secure so I understand that we are equals and have to work together. 

My hope is that someday when all this social media hype and pop psychology surrounding attachment theory dies down, we can start to focus on the things that will help heal the rift among insecure attachments: Communication, self awareness, a willingness to change behaviors that might not suit you so well anymore, compromise, love, respect, patience, understanding. And that we can stop seeing others as an attachment identity and start to see the whole picture with compassion.",txliow,30,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/txliow/i_have_an_avoidant_attachment_but_its_not_my/,AvoidantAttachment,0
437,"The more I heal, the less I want to heal.","I had to have an emergency session with my therapist today because I spent the entire weekend being suicidal to the point that I was making plans. I emailed him this morning and his office called as soon as they opened. The first thing he said to me when I went in was ""I knew if you were emailing me it was serious.""

We talked about what was going on. I recently restarted EMDR which brought up some long buried emotions. I also upped my antidepressant dose in the last couple of weeks. And I started the process of an autism assessment. On top of that I've just been feeling an overall burnout. I'm a single mom to 3 boys full time - none of them go to their dad's which means I get no break. I just have been feeling heavy lately.

Today he kind of let me ramble on and didn't really give too much feedback. There were a few things I said that stood out to me. The biggest thing being ""No one is taking care of me."" For as long as I can remember I've taken care of myself. I soothed myself when I was upset. I taught myself basic tasks. I spent most of my time alone as a child. As a teenager I was in relationships where the men abused me, and I realized today that the longer I'm in a romantic relationship the less I trust the man. No one in my entire life aside from myself has ever taken care of me.

And let's be honest. Me taking care of myself has meant shoving everything down, pretending I'm okay when I'm not, convincing myself I don't need anyone, numbing myself out because feeling hurts too much. There are really only 2 scenarios where I feel safe and calm and normal - therapy, and when I'm with my boyfriend.

The more therapy I do, the more trauma comes up. The more trauma comes up, the more I hurt. The more I hurt, the less I want to do therapy. The more I spend time with my boyfriend, the more time I want to spend with him. The more I want to spend with him, the more I realize that's not what he wants. The more I realize that's not what he wants, the less time I want to spend with him.

I feel like I'm stuck in this cycle, and I find myself wishing I could go back to before I started healing. My little bubble of avoidance was so much easier to deal with on a daily basis. And yet, I've come this far and giving up seems like the wrong choice as well. I know this is what I have to do to truly heal. I know I have to go through is instead of pretending it doesn't exist.

438,The Crushing Responsibility of Happiness,"Just had a therapy session and wanted to share a few things in case they're helpful for others, and because writing helps me solidify things. I'll try to keep it brief but that's not my strong suit.

At the beginning of the session I said, ""I'm not sure what to talk about,"" which hasn't been true for many months as I've been in fairly acute crisis.

About mid-way through the session I started to feel a heaviness, and found myself unable to look at her and wanting to hide. This doesn't happen to me very often in therapy as it's my total safe place. I expressed it but couldn't articulate why, so we did a body scan and had a quiet moment and I was able to find what was behind it.

Just a quick warning that I am going to talk about everything I have going for me right now, and it's uncomfortable and I feel like I'm bragging or something—but it ties into what I'm trying to share here and feels important. I'm kind of in a position right now, for the first time in my life, where I am in a relationship that is likely going to keep growing and deepening and is likely to turn into the family I've always wanted—really long term, really committed. I love him deeply and I don't doubt that this is what I want—also a first for me. I'm in school which feels wonderful, pursuing a career that I am deeply passionate about, and I also am not doubting this decision one iota, which is also a first. In the meantime, my work life is really flexible and creative, and isn't stressful. Also a first. I'm reasonably financially stable, which is a first \*while\* not grinding myself to a pulp to get there. I'm developing a couple of good nourishing friendships, and doing a little better with my family relations. I have a great dog and a working vehicle and am pretty healthy. I know my interests and values pretty well and feel like how I'm living my life aligns with them. What the fuck.

Ok, so in the moment of overwhelm with my therapist, the feeling was of a great responsibility to relax and be happy and enjoy my life, and being deeply afraid that I'm just not up to the task. I've never just... lived before. Just been in the flow of life. Not fixing, overhauling, disrupting, blowing up, or grinding. I am successfully resisting/releasing/managing all my usual FA/codependent/undifferentiated moves of finding the problem, taking on other people's problems if I can't find enough of my own to hold my attention (which of course I had no idea the extent to which I do for a long time, even after ten years of therapy), trying to control uncontrollable things, getting rigid, thinking I need to urgently make decisions or changes, and needlessly/endlessly analyzing.

There's a strange kind of heaviness but also emptiness that is coming with this. My therapist used the word ""unnerving,"" and that's right. It's a feeling of being inadequate to actually keep things running this smoothly. Of being undeserving of what could potentially be \[the first\] truly happy phase for my life. And of the other shoe surely waiting to drop, and needing to be vigilant to spot it and catch it and fix it and...

It's been one week of me being in this position across all these areas of my life, things kind of suddenly coalescing. I'd noticed the discomfort this week but hadn't named it until now. The thing is, I don't even think I could've let myself get here before the work I've been doing — allowing myself to make sound decisions, stick with things, trust myself, and go for what I want has landed me here. 

In this session we dug real deep, about how in general people spiraling out, controlling, distracting themselves, problem-solving, procrastinating, etc. is ultimately just avoiding our mortality. When we relax into our lives, we have to admit that this is how we're spending them, and they won't last forever. If we perpetually feel unsettled in what we're doing, we can kind of create a delusion that we're more infinite than we are—that there's more time, and more options than we really have.

It was a good, good, good session. Gonna be just sitting with this one for a while. I'll be in the bath.",s86u45,30,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s86u45/the_crushing_responsibility_of_happiness/,AvoidantAttachment,0
439,Does anyone else suddenly alternate between emotional and detached?,"I’ve noticed that my feelings can turn on and off quite suddenly for no apparent reason, especially in relation to romantic relationships. 

I ended things with my bf a few days ago. That day and the next day I felt devastated, crying my eyes out, unable to function until the evening when suddenly I felt kind of over it and not sad. 

Then yesterday night he messaged me saying he wanted to go no contact for a while. And then I felt the emotion super intensely again. Crying for hours, ruminating, unable to sleep, totally caught up in it. 

And again today, same thing happened, felt very upset first thing but feel incredibly neutral and kind of over it now. 

I find that this happens when I’m in a relationship as well. When I’m physically with my partner I tend to feel very close and loving and affectionate and into them. But a day or two after being away from them I feel very detached. Even if we message. It’s hard because I feel like I alternate between feeling very close and then completely unattached based on recency of direct contact. 

Does anyone else experience this ever? No one I know in real life has ever talked about it.",s0rzst,31,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s0rzst/does_anyone_else_suddenly_alternate_between/,AvoidantAttachment,0
440,"Being hypercritical, hot & cold, wanting my own space in new relationship. I'm so exhausted","I've been seeing someone new for the last couple months. There are so many positive things about them that I really like - and they seem to be super into me, which is both awesome and rather troubling, as I feel like it's allowing me to take advantage by setting a ton of my own perimeters for the relationship.

I only came across attachment theory late last year and it's blown my mind. So much of my approach to relationships makes sense now - I've always been really hypercritical once I'm dating someone, noticing every possible flaw that turns me off, quietly resenting everything about them in my head until I convince myself I don't actually find them attractive. I also get increasingly desperate for my own space and eventually shut down, ignoring texts for days at a time.

So, with this new person I'm dating, I've finally been able to communicate more. It's worlds apart from my last relationship which was like 4 years ago. we've had some vulnerable conversations and explanations of how I feel.  I've been able to set boundaries and explained why I need them. Over the holidays I said I needed alone time and they happily stopped messaging me for like a week. It was  a   
 hell of a relief,. even though I then had a low level panic most of the time that I'd ruined the relationship by asking for that space.

Basically it's all just becoming exhausting. Every therapy session I'm in floods of tears as I dissect all these childhood wounds that have led me to being FA - and it feels like every time I meet up with this person for a date I'm challenging myself to cope with attachment issues.

In a perfect (and admittedly selfish) world, what I really want is to meet up maybe once a week with no expectation that we'll be physical, and then virtually no texting in between, so I can continue to feel like my over-independent, insular self for the majority of the time. I'm fully aware how unappealing that must be for the other person, and probably doesn't indicate a good future relationship either!!

I guess I could do with some input from others who've been hypervigilant and deactivate regularly at the start of a relationship. Did you end things early on, or manage to ride it out and stay the course? Did things get better as the relationship progressed, and if yes, what led to things getting better?",ry6abw,30,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ry6abw/being_hypercritical_hot_cold_wanting_my_own_space/,AvoidantAttachment,0

442,"{DA} Get professional help now, the benefits will pay dividends.","Meet an amazing woman who I wanted to marry a month after dating.  She got pregnant before I could propose and spent that next 5 years being in a relationship and raising a child. 

Having a two new people in my life left little room for me to go to my coping, and as such fell into a deep depression.   And for my partner I was disinterested in everything, especially family activities, but also sex, date nights, any thing fun, planning, and just fell in a rut of boring. 

And when she tried to get me to open up I felt nothing. This person is /was my best friend. She saw me for who I was and tried to get me help, to see a therapist, to do things that would bring me joy, indulge my sex fantasies but I continued to feel gross for having feelings. To want or need things. 

Now 5 years later we are broken up, and finally coming to terms with my in action.  We are great coparents together. And continue to live under the same roof because we want to be involved in our daughter's life. 

So I currently sleep in the guest room, and was initially so excited to have a room to decorate and control. But after finally finding how my routines are how I cope with emotions, I now see my consistency and routine as bug not a feature. 

My ex called that I would change when we broke up, cause most men wait to late. And she was right, I found this group, looked for a therapist, and have force my self to  sitting with my emotions even if I have none  when I want to go into my routine.

443,"{FA} vs {DA} and feeling ""trapped""","FA with a hard DA lean here / 38 / F

I've been thinking a lot about one of my core wounds and key triggers: feeling trapped. I'm now in my 19th year of marriage to a secure man with the patience of a saint. Our marriage is wonderful now, but we've had many years of very hard times and a large part of it has been me feeling trapped and lashing out (I'm just now realizing this as I've been working to heal; I was unaware at the time). I am very happy I am married to him, he's a wonderful spouse and person, and I have no regrets about my choice in partners. Nevertheless, I have nightmares about feeling trapped. I get physical sensations in my body about feeling trapped. I get shortness of breath when I think about having to live full time with him again when I'm finished with my doctorate. My feelings of being trapped have little to do with him. He and I live in separate countries half the year, we only talk on the phone a couple of times a week, and he is so good about giving me a ton of space. He's a rock star. So it's not him, it's the status of being married, and since I'm religious, I don't have the option of divorce except in very specific circumstances. When I had a baby (unplanned), I deactivated so hard that I cut out all of my closest friends. Getting married and being a mother are major triggers for my feelings of being ""trapped"", because the thought of losing autonomy, freedom, and of feeling any hint of being out of control of my own life causes me a lot of angst. I can't stand the thought of being ""tied down"".

However, I recently watched [one of Thais Gibson's videos on DAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txliQivkvFw&t=278s&ab_channel=ThePersonalDevelopmentSchool) and she was saying that for DAs, the fear of being trapped is a result of their feelings of being unable to get out of a committed relationship that is no longer serving them because of their aversion to change. This is not a problem for me as an FA, I have zero problem exiting relationships and I love change. I was surprised that this seems to be a significant difference between DAs and FAs when on the outside, the core wound of ""I am trapped"" is the same, but the underlying reason seems quite different. I'm trying to figure out if I'm an outlier, or if this is actually a difference between DAs and FAs.

I'm just wondering if other DAs and FAs care to comment on their experience surrounding feeling trapped. Is that one of your core triggers, and if so, what is it the causes you to feel trapped?",10qeo3b,29,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/10qeo3b/fa_vs_da_and_feeling_trapped/,AvoidantAttachment,0

446,Extract from a letter I {fa} wrote to my ex,"Some context: my ex and I broke up about 6 weeks ago, and I haven't been having a great time of it. It sounds dumb, but the trigger for the breakup was me happening to see a YouTube video about avoidant attachment, and feeling so utterly called out that it sent me spiralling, and I ended a relationship of three years. Over my adult life, I have often written letters to exes, although not all of them end up delivered. Sometimes just the act of writing is enough, and sometimes there are things that I think they need to know. This letter I did hand over, and there's a lot of other, unrelated stuff in there, but I wanted to share the section I wrote about avoidant attachment here.  
  
> I am afraid. Of quite a lot of things. But fear rules my life more completely than I ever realised. You of all people will know how afraid of coming out [as trans] to my parents I am, and the complexity of that fear. Rationally I know that they are good people who will try to understand. But emotionally, I have so much trauma in my past that informs how I interact with the world today. I once thought that was just as a result of telling mum and dad about [getting someone pregnant when I was 18], and their reaction to that conversation. But it goes much further back than that. As a child and a teenager, time and again I opened myself up to friends and was either abandoned or betrayed. Even just thinking about and writing this has me feeling tense, ready for fight or flight. I have 30 years of experiences telling me that I should be afraid of openness, and vulnerability. Because I have learned and internalised that I will always end up worse off for it. And so I learned to run away from it, to turn off what I'm feeling because if I don't feel anything or communicate what I'm experiencing, then I won't run the risk of being abandoned or hurt again. That's what that YouTube video about attachment styles forced me to confront. What I thought was a rational, controlled approach to my emotions was actually complete and total disconnection from them. I saw for the first time how broken I am. It revealed just how much work there was to be done, and just how much vulnerability it would require to fix. And that terrified me. Because being vulnerable makes people go away. Opening up to you would make you go away. It's not attractive to be weak. It's not attractive to be afraid of being abandoned. It's not attractive to _need_ someone. I was afraid that if you ever saw just how broken I am, you would realise that I am completely unlovable, and would consign me to the past like so many before. Of course none of those things are true. Weakness, vulnerability, a need for support... none of those things make someone unlovable. But I dealt with things the only way I knew how. I shut down my feelings, forced myself to be ""rational"" and started looking outwards for problems that I could fix. I identified genuine concerns and worries about our relationship and turned molehills into mountains. I ignored the good, the security I felt, and the trust I felt in you, and came up with shallow reasons for why we should break up. I tried to make it seem like you were the problem, but if only I had the courage to speak openly to you about all those things that were worrying me and the reasons why, then we might be in a very different position today.
> 
> The truth is that I am scared of losing myself. Scared that in becoming ever closer and more vulnerable with you, that the ""me"" that I rigidly cling onto for safety would disappear. And who would I be then? Would I even be me anymore? What if I just became a reflection of you? What if years into the future I realise I made the wrong choice and had wasted our lives? What if I allow myself to be loved by you and I end up completely letting you down? What if you didn't actually love me but pitied me? What if I end up alone forever? I should have told you about these fears when they cropped up, but I was convinced that they would prove that I am not worthy of your love. None of them are rational, and all of them perhaps could have been resolved. Maybe not completely, maybe not all at once. But slowly, over months and years. Instead I chose to destroy what we had built, because I was afraid of all this and more besides. I am furious at myself for that, and have been trying with limited success to let go out an enormous amount of self-hatred over it.
> 
> I know I can't turn back the clock. But I wish that I had been able to come to terms with all of this from within the safety of our relationship, and the warmth of your love. I wish that I had been calmer, and kept pausing when I felt fear, instead of ploughing ahead into destroying our relationship. I wish I weren't so scared of needing someone. Or so scared of being alone. I am still afraid, [ex's name]. Scared that I will forever be broken. That nobody is going to be able to love a 30 year-old, emotionally avoidant trans woman with a child. Afraid that even if I somehow win that lottery a second time, I will simply end up right back here: alone, in pain, and hating myself. None of this is an excuse for how I treated you, but I hope you can see that it is the reason. Again, I am not asking you to take me back. I think I just needed you to know that I get it. I understand your frustrations with me, and how difficult I made things. Something I have been working on is separating fault and responsibility. The trauma in my past is not my fault, but I have to take responsibility for how it makes me react as an adult. This is me attempting to shoulder that burden. And if I'm honest, this is me asking for forgiveness.
> 
> You accepted me at one of the most vulnerable times of my life. And I cannot ever properly express how glad I am that you did. I wish so much that that experience of opening up was enough to cure me of my fears of being vulnerable with you, but I couldn't always find my way to trusting that it was safe to be honest.",10908xq,30,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/10908xq/extract_from_a_letter_i_fa_wrote_to_my_ex/,AvoidantAttachment,0

It's worse if I've not seen them for a while or when I first meet up with them. They feel like a stranger, and it can take my brain a few hours to catch up. When I was very triggered it would be that I could be in the same room as my partner, talk to someone else and I would go back to my partner and they would look or feel like a stranger.

448,The guilt of having someone wait for me {fa},"When I met my bf not-bf I posted here about how I genuinely believe he is the best person for me, nothing I don't like about him, etc. I got severe trauma symptoms so bad I was asked to leave my job and didn't leave my room for 6 weeks except to get the food delivery that I could barely eat. My mindset at the time was these sacrifices will be worth it if my deactivation calms down - it didn't. I've never met anyone like him. There's still no actual things we don't like about each other except my FA, best connection both of us have ever had by a mile, incredible communication, any arguments have stemmed from my fear of intimacy. Not all connections are a replaceable 'Move on, plenty more fish in the sea' kinda thing.

A year on, I've committed to healing and we still both desperately want to be together. I've gone from being worried I'm a monster who can't feel love, to being (I would guess) around 75% worked through my avoidant side. The method I'm using, the avoidance goes first and then you see the preoccupation come up. I spend hours a day trauma healing and it's working amazingly.(Ideal Parent Figure for anyone wondering). I've sacrificed my career, social life and housing situation in order to have the money and time to heal because I know this is more important to me and that this man is the LOML, even if my brain thinks it's unsafe to feel. We should be able to move the relationship fast when my avoidance is gone because we know each other well enough to move in now - but I need to be able to let love in first.

He's essentially waiting for me and we're stronger than ever, because things are looking positive for us. I'm way more accepting of affection although I'm still deactivated, I'm confident that will lift in time. It feels as simple as rewiring the belief 'If I let other people in, I won't be allowed to have my own needs.'

However, I'm a massive people pleaser and I'm really struggling with both the guilt of having someone wait for me, and worrying about what others, e.g his friends or family think about me. I always try and do the right thing so this is tough for me.

Whenever I see posts and comments and things about 'Don't waste your time waiting for someone' and 'If they wanted to they would' kind of things, I go into a massive shame spiral. Seeing as I want to be with him and I've been extremely dedicated to doing the work I'd be stupid to leave now it's so obviously working. In the last year I have met the man of my dreams, found out I have PTSD, committed to healing and being mostly healed.

Some things that help is watching Paulien Timmer videos about how she went from repulsed by her partner to feeling in love again after healing her schemas, testimonials from others doing IPF, and reminding myself that I should give him the agency to choose to wait, and that the trauma wants me to run.

I have to remind myself that other people have done much worse things, e.g put someone in this position when they don't do the work or don't actually want to be with the person, had affairs etc. I'm struggling with being 'chaotic' cause I'm generally not 'chaotic' at all.

449,{DA} Link between dismissive-avoidant attachment and fear of pregnancy?,"I know there's a strong tendency for DA's to want to be child-free, but I've been wondering if there's also a link between avoidant attachment and fear of the actual experience of pregnancy/birth.

I'm a DA who's moved towards secure after a \*lot\* of work; pretty firmly child-free for most of my life until meeting my current partner. He would love to have a family (biological or adopted), and would make an amazing dad, and it's of course prompted me to get really honest with myself about my feelings on having kids.

The place I have a huge amount of emotional charge/resistance is when thinking about the actual experience of pregnancy and delivery. It probably falls into the realm of phobia -- lots of physical reactions like nausea, anxiety, wanting to run away, wanting to literally kick and scream at anyone who's 'making' me do this (even though no one is making me do anything) -- total system overload and really hard to think clearly about any of it.

I'm noticing that the feelings that come up around this are almost identical to the deactivation experience that happens in interpersonal relationships. Things like not being able to see any of the ""good"" but having a myopic, magnified awareness of everything bad (even just distant hypotheticals), feeling suffocated, a sense of nervous system overwhelm, total inability to cope, doom view of the future. It feels like a bunch of energy going into pushing the experience away because of how it activates my attachment system.

I also have some fear around another human being dependent on me for so long, but through the various emotional work I've done over the last few years, this fear has subsided quite a bit. The fear around pregnancy and childbirth remains as strong as ever, though.

I'm wondering if any other avoidants have similar feelings, especially those who identify as child-free. When you peel it back to the exact spots where ""having a kid"" becomes a no, is any of it related to the physical experience of pregnancy?",yilrzg,28,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/yilrzg/da_link_between_dismissiveavoidant_attachment_and/,AvoidantAttachment,0
450,"Hello, I'm {fa} this close to ghosting someone","Fearful avoidant, leaning dismissive avoidant atm

I met this person a couple of months ago, things were very intense and in a lot of ways pushed me far beyond what I could keep up with, I remember being very overwhelmed. I've been at sea for just under two months since , but we've stayed in contact with each other, or well, more like I've tried to keep up with answering his long, long messages about how much he misses me, replying with a ""i miss you too"" or if I couldn't even manage that, at least a ""looking forward to seeing you again soon"" despite how much it feels like pulling teeth. And like, it shouldn't be like this, should it?? I should be able to mean it.

It's inevitable that I let him down. I cannot keep up with the level of affection he gives me, and the level of affection he expects in return. Not being enough and not being able to give enough of myself because I lean avoidant is a deep insecurity of mine and it's why I've fled many relationships in the past. When things get intense and when I receive a lot of affection and the other person in the relationship begins to depend a lot on me emotionally I get scared because I'm much more reserved and I cannot ""give"" much in return, and I don't want to, it feels unsafe and scary. I don't want to be depended upon too much. I don't let myself depend much on other people either.

He's very anxious and very open (which becomes a burden, I keep thinking ""please protect your heart a lil more"" and I realize that what I mean is ""protect your heart from me""). During the summer when we hung out together I was kind of able to push some of all my anxieties down for him, I see now that I was shutting down in order to be there for him 'cause he was riding a lot of emotional roller coasters, I think because of me, but it may be why he feels so safe depending on me still. I was sometimes so empty inside I felt robotic, yet somehow it made pull myself together enough to like, calm him down from things. I feel so bad for not being as able to be there for him now, but it's too much. I'm sorry for my English by the way, I'm usually more eloquent, but I have a headache.

Anyway, he's planning for me to come visit soon (he lives roughly two hours away now), and I've just kind of been passive concerning the whole thing - he's planning, I'm just trying to survive headaches and agonizing over things. I am so very tired mentally. I know, for one thing, that he will expect sex when I come visit, and I'm at the point where I almost want to just message him and tell him that I will not have sex with him if I am to visit, I can't stand even the thought of it. I think my depression is acting up because I am so, so tired, I'd like to just lay down in some creek and look up at the sky for hours or days or years until I feel able to face the world again.

When I feel ugly and confused on the inside, it becomes scary to be told so earnestly that I'm so perfect and lovely. Earlier this summer when we were hanging out he'd become so sad when I wasn't feeling good. I felt as if I couldn't be feeling low around him because it affected him so much, he even told me how much it hurt him to see me sad, and how much it hurt him when I couldn't give him much in terms of affection when I didn't feel good. When i wanted to hide in my bed and cease existing, he'd just stay there in bed with me and pity me, yet ask for my love, and I'd feel small and inadequate, which I hate. Fuck. I don't fault him for it much, I just hate myself instead. It sucks.

I feel awful about all this. It's unfair to him, but I feel myself leaning towards cutting ties abruptly like I have with others in the past, it's like there's this voice screaming at me to run. I've been telling myself I'll visit for a couple of days and see how things play out, but fucking hell I want to just run from it all and shut down until I'm at a safe distance to let myself process things properly. I don't mean to ghost whenever I do, but it's like I freeze, and ghosting is the easy way out.

I'm sorry for venting like this, honestly, but some of you have probably been where I am now. Any advice welcome.",xbttz1,28,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/xbttz1/hello_im_fa_this_close_to_ghosting_someone/,AvoidantAttachment,0

456,I act just like my father. {da} {fa},"The other day I got into an argument w my Dad. He has dementia and is disabled but unfortunately my emotions were everywhere so yes, we still argued. I woke up to do my usual routine of making breakfast, passing out meds. We had a doctors appointment to go to in the afternoon. His dentures had to be sanitized and I asked him how and he said just warm water which I thought was weird but did anyways.

Basically, I don’t think he appreciated that I found it weird. He claims that he had asked me to run warm water for him to take a bath (which never happened) and that I was refusing. I went to go run water. I put him in the tub, and the entire time he’s micro managing. 

After the bath, he starts to tell me how I don’t do anything around this house, despite me being his full time caregiver. He tells me how selfish I am. I say that he’s upset and I’m just responding back. He interrupts me a thousand times and I point out he’s not listening and just wants to argue. 

Then it hit me.

How I show up in conflict with my girlfriend is how he shows up with me. My dad is one of the most passive aggressive people I know. As a child he could neve be straight forward with what we did that bothered him. He’d rather punish us and not answer questions about what we did wrong. He was apathetic towards our wants and needs. He would get upset when we needed deodorant, clothes, shoes. He never spent quality time with us. 

I realized I was arguing with my Dad from such a secure standpoint. I was being straight forward, asking him what was wrong, offering solutions, bluntly advocating for what I needed and how I felt. I realized even though I show these traits in anger, this is who I truly am. 

I completely mimic everything he does to me with my girlfriend and just now realizing it goes back to him. It made me feel shocked because I truly have a cycle to break. 

Can anyone else relate? Has anyone else made it to the other side?

457,Instincts are so strong {DA},"Avoidant instincts are so **STRONG**, guys.

I think I'm relatively earned secure but I have this close, platonic friendship that share a lot of characteristics of a serious romantic relationship.

She has been (incessantly) asking me to move away with her. Recently, I told her I won't and she was bummed and told me about her dream's vision for our life together.

It was beautiful and sounded really good. I want it too. But I don't want to move as I have other valid plans and reasons.

Its hard for me to explain that and its hard for her to understand.

I think this is the same scenario for a romantic couple. ""If we are clearly super compatible and having a great time together, why not make the next step"", sorta deal. Even my mom is like, why don't you move with her.

I told her I plan to visit her when she moves on a regular schedule and she's a bit realistic and raised the concern over whether or not I'd become tired of doing that. I had an honest moment with myself. I acknowledged it as a commitment and agreed I can. Not only because of her but because of my other interests tied to that location.

She verbally wrestles with me about this topic and because of my avoidance, I passively allow her to come up with more debates from different angles to try to convince me. Its very difficult to disappoint her continuously. And I can't blame her, she's trying to fight for something she really, really wants.

And then my avoidant brain starts doing its thing. I find myself for the first time, planning to do things without her for an emotional break. My brain starts coming up with negative ulterior reasons why she actually wants me to move. My avoidance is literally trying to sabotage this otherwise wonderful relationship. All because I don't like to see her disappointed. That's so wild.

I think the underlying fear is that she will abandon me or this relationship will change for the worse. Which is so contradictory to my other feelings of ""being ready to be alone"" again. These days, I'm craving alone time. But I think its because I'm avoiding being confronted about this again.

It is so weird to be absolutely in love with someone but have another part of me being ready for it to be over and find peace in that.",viwe0v,29,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/viwe0v/instincts_are_so_strong_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
458,{FA} Realizations and Learning Yourself,"I am interested to know—for those who are currently working on themselves: what is something about yourself that you have discovered recently?

As avoidants, I think we do have the tendency to displace our feelings, leaving us unable to process properly. To combat that, I do a lot of writing, researching and general self-reflection.

Most recently I have come to the conclusion that:

I do not need to retaliate when I am feeling unfulfilled.

It is very hard not to allow myself to immediately disconnect when I feel I am not being cared for and I am still struggling with it. It is something that I have to constantly remind myself of. This behavior is not healthy and needs to be changed.

i've been pushing myself to sit with my discomfort for over 3 months at this point and it has not become any easier. today im going to get in my car and drive away for the first time in a while. i can't live like this anymore. it's too much for me. i feel so much more comfort when i am alone. i feel at peace. from what i read, healing a DA attachment style is a lifelong thing. i have done so much work to heal from things i have experienced, and i want to be done. i don't want to fight this forever. i just want to sit with it. i am comfortable with being DA. im sick of trying to fight it.",txrtd2,29,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/txrtd2/healing_is_too_difficult_for_me_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
461,{da} How do I know whether to break up with someone or stick it out?,"As someone with a dismissive avoidant attachment style, my relationships don't last long. Things are normally okay for the first month or so and then I start to withdraw or get annoyed with my partner. It's very difficult for me to tell when I should break up with someone. Most the time I verge on breaking up because I tend to attract those with anxious attachment styles and I feel like I'm just being an ass to them. 

Like my current boyfriend loves texting, wants to hang out a few times a week, says he misses me all the time, and loves physical touch and words of affirmation. I think he views our relationship as much more serious than I do. Things felt like they were moving too fast for me. I communicated this to him and he was very understanding telling me to let him know what I need and that he would give me space. But I feel like what I need is for him to like me or miss me less and to not want so much intimacy and words of affirmation out of me. I don't think that's a fair thing to ask of him.

463,DBT Skills Series - Introduction,"In an effort to provide some content that isn't relationship related, and may actually help with working through our emotions and avoidance, I'm going to post a series on DBT skills. I will most likely start this next week after the holiday. 

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) focuses on teaching skills that can help you live a productive life. DBT is helpful for people with depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorders, addictions, eating disorder, and PTSD.

DBT skills are broken up into four main categories to help you deal with emotions and problem solving:

1. **Mindfulness** \- the core skill in DBT is being able to non-judgmentally observe yourself and your surroundings. You will become more aware of the physical and mental triggers that cause runaway emotions.
2. **Distress Tolerance** \- deal with painful situations. When you can't change the situation, learn how to tolerate it, accept it, and move forward.
3. **Emotion Regulation** \- learning to make your emotions work for you. Learn to recognize when an emotion is unproductive and change it into a more productive emotion.
4. **Interpersonal** **Relationships** \- change the way you communicate so you get more out of your relationships. Learn to communicate what you want. Become comfortable saying no.

Each of these categories has a set of skills that you can employ to help you process situations and change your perspective moving forward. I personally have found DBT to be incredibly helpful in combating my own anxiety and avoidance. 

I will post an overview of 1 skill every 2-3 days in no particular order. Some skills go hand in hand or work very closely together. I do highly recommend if this is something you're interested in that you purchase the [DBT Skills Training](https://www.amazon.com/Skills-Training-Handouts-Worksheets-Second/dp/1572307811/ref=asc_df_1572307811/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312089933244&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1236714147187323249&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016345&hvtargid=pla-627192426952&psc=1) workbook for less than $30 on Amazon. It's definitely something that is easy to process and understand on your own, and the worksheets are super helpful for learning the skills. 

I will be pulling most of my material from [this](https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/) website, which has been a great resource to me doing this on my own time. I also spent a year in group and individual DBT therapy, and employ a lot of the skills naturally now. I'm hoping to provide some content on ways to actually heal and change behaviors because I feel we need more of that.

464,How to not start disliking somebody that likes you,"Any time someone develops some sort of liking for me and shares that, I almost immediately start disliking them 'organically' just because they have expressed they like me. This is often very difficult and makes me feel bad and strange, as these are often very worthy, interesting, and lovely people. I want to have and/or develop mechanisms to counteract that, as it really hurts to start disliking someone just because they like me and have dared to be brave and vulnerable to share that. 

I sometimes wonder if my lack of self-love is so deeply ingrained and is what causes that.

465,"DAE feel like when they try to be vulnerable, they're reminded of why they're avoidant?","I always feel pretty lonely and I know for the most part it's my fault because I keep people at a distance. However, the times I do open up to people about what's going, they almost feed into my avoidance by not being supportive in the ways I want them to.

I wrote in a group chat of four close friends about being lonely at college. Only one person responded, and they answered ""well you'll be graduating soon"". Today a friend texted me that they were thinking of me, I responded that the text really meant a lot to me because I've been feeling lonely lately. They asked a question inquiring about if I'm just lonely at school or in life in general. I responded both, and they stopped answering. 

It's interactions like these that deter me from being vulnerable with others. Perhaps I over-think everything or it's confirmation bias, but it feels like an endless loop of being avoidant and lonely, giving people a chance, and then getting reminded of why I'm avoidant.

467,{DA} I'm (32f) not feeling committed to my LTR anymore... can the feelings come back?,"I've been with my bf (32m) for a little over seven years now, and a variety of stressors has made me feel just really tired of the relationship and the associated responsibilities. I started seeing a therapist in Feb (he has too, and we've started couples' therapy...) after he was gone for a while to take care of his sick mom, because I was really struggling with strong feelings that I didn't understand, including feeling very distanced from him.

One contributor is that I'm very not interested in sex, and I never have been; it was easier at the start of the relationship because I knew he derived a lot of good feeling from it, but I never did it for me. Even kissing is kind of blech for me. It had been getting harder to want to do it - don't get me wrong, he is very considerate in that regard, it just feels wasted on me. It turned into a bit of a vicious cycle - I didn't want to do it, so I'd withdraw and withhold affection to avoid the situation, he would get more physically affectionate to try to initiate sex, I'd eventually relent to get him to stop, repeat ad nauseam... Since having some discussions, we've come to a different arrangement, but I fear the damage is irreparable (or would be very difficult to fix), and I'm not sure for how long he'll be happy with this arrangement.

He also definitely tends toward an anxious attachment style, exacerbated by other stressors in his life at the moment. I feel like it's a monumental effort for me to give him all the attention and love and affection he wants, and I've just been feeling an overwhelming desire to be alone for several months now, and try to work on better understanding and accepting myself. I struggle knowing whether I can rekindle my feelings, or if that's just an impossibly steep battle. It feels cruel to keep going, to feel like I'm stringing him along, that I'm starving him of the affection he needs and wants; it also feels cruel to leave him when he's got so much other stressful and scary stuff piled up on him (but I don't know that I can provide the support he needs, especially if/when his mom's health finally fails). To put it plainly, I just want to give up and run away. I'm feeling like despite my long time in this relationship, I'm actually really not ready, or that what I really want is just a very safe companionship without the romance?

I don't really know what I'm asking for, here... I guess advice, or validation, similar experiences. I guess especially if anyone's also been in a long-term anxious/avoidant relationship, whether it worked out or not, and if it didn't, how you approached the breakup; if it worked, what you were able to do to change.",15pfknr,28,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15pfknr/da_im_32f_not_feeling_committed_to_my_ltr_anymore/,AvoidantAttachment,0
468,Realizing your past partner was right about a lot of things about you {fa},"Hey everyone,

I started working with a therapist recently and it's been a real slap to the face. 

My past partner and I would go back and forth in these hot/cold moments where we'd be like two little love birds only for me to get angry and ghost him because of past projections/traumas and he would try and work me through them. 

At the time we dated he was in therapy and I couldn't connect with anyone like I did to him and I think I ended up making him my therapist which he tried to avoid. I've now started to see a therapist quite regularly and I'm now realizing all the things my ex said about himself and me are... True. 

He was a healing FA, very quick to confrontation but compassionate and I am an FA very quick to run away. I'd ghost him often or start fights right after having a nice day with him and he'd ask me what's wrong only for me to lie. 

We no longer speak but why is taking a ""professional"" telling me the same thing my past partner did for me to realize I was the red flag? 

Some thoughts I had on this is he would blame himself for things not going to plan, as in quick to apologize if I got triggered, tried to fix things if something went wrong or he triggered me or even wanted me to talk about what triggered me in that situation which was more emotional work causing me to get exhausted of him.",15lgf8a,28,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15lgf8a/realizing_your_past_partner_was_right_about_a_lot/,AvoidantAttachment,0
469,Rejection Sensitivity {FA},"I wonder if I am in this alone.

I used to self-sabotage by dating people that I didn’t have nothing in common with, the attachment would still trigger me, but the “we are not going to end up together”was law “rejection was already there”, so I felt safe, and not shocked, when stuff came to an end (every end makes me sad, I cry and move on fast from my emotions for that person) 

The reason I subconsciously didn’t date people I liked and had things in common, was/is that I am very sensitive and I know that for me being rejected by someone I am actually emotionally invested on hurts more and longer. First and last time I have ever dated someone I liked we entered that unhealthy dance, both so triggered, swinging made me feel so crazy, not being able to get out the spiral was very re-traumatizing for me. 

 I have been on a couple of dates ever since and realized I went back to my default, dating people that I was indifferent about, that I didn’t like really, I have decided to be on my own for now, but I still feel “residues of that past rejection” I fear to like someone and be lurking for signs of rejection.",12etkqz,27,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/12etkqz/rejection_sensitivity_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
470,{DA} having the worst vulnerability hangover of my life. need a gentle reality check,"hi all, hope everyone's doing well. in short, i was ghosted by someone i trusted and gave a lot of my time to, which is causing a significant relapse in my attachment style. i've basically swung back to full DA in my attachment after identifying as secure for over two years. i'm having a really rough vulnerability hangover where i just feel thoroughly embarrassed, disgusted, and afraid that i let this person know me beyond surface level - to the point where i'm getting active anxiety over them using that information against me (e.g., the fun week-long disassociation that came from the intrusive thought of, ""oh god, they knew i was closeted, what if they out me, how do i scour my texts to come up with a plan"").

upon reflection, i think the anxiety is stemming from me wanting to cut this person out of my life for good - block them, stop reaching out on days that i know they'll need extra emotional support (e.g., the grief anniversary of a family member), fully give up on any notion that this person can hold space in my heart again. some other places in my thought process:

* i'm cognizant that there's a difference between hurting someone to protect yourself, and hurting someone sadistically. my heartrate is not catching up to my brain.
* this person almost certainly is not getting the same anxiety that i'd do something terrible to them, which should tell me something. both that it's not their mantra, but also that most people just... aren't that pathological.
* i really just need to have more faith in people.
* i think this is definitely a people-pleasing related wound, where i think that catastrophically terrible things will happen to me if i put myself first.
* DAE ever get that vulnerability hangover of it doesn't *matter* that the odds of it happening are low, it's just embarrassing that i yielded that power and information to someone in the first place?

some other info that might be useful to explaining why i'm so triggered:

* ghoster is an unaware DA. made me their only support system while grieving and ghosted me when i asked for emotional support in return. literally made fun of me for crying in front of them and called me oversensitive when i told them i didn't appreciate how i was being spoken to, and that grief wasn't an excuse for verbal abuse (i think it's important context that this was 8 months in, not 8 days in, and that i didn't bring up the grief. i just generally said i didn't like how i was being spoken to). it's causing me a lot of pain to feel that i still owe this person anything. they've reached out a few times since the ghosting which is kind of frustrating because honestly, if they'd just kept ghosting me, i would figure they never wanted to hear from me again and that i could keep moving on. i wrote about this more in a different post on the subreddit so i won't go too into it.
* vulnerability hangover aside, i'm definitely still processing the betrayal itself
* ghoster replaced me for friends that are AP/FA swinging. they knew me somewhat and definitely chose my ghoster - so there's a vulnerability hangover with them too of, ""they know personal info about me and my triggered, non-regulated self is getting paranoid / assuming people will try to hurt me."" especially because for my experience, AP's are a lot more volatile in how they react when insecure.
* they do have information that could really hurt me - i don't know if they'd think to use it, but that's one of the downsides of trusting friends who end up not being my friends
* i have a history of ocd/ptsd which is definitely feeding this hypervigilant monster

i'm in therapy and looking forward to my next session, but i specifically wanted an avoidant reality checl/perspective on what to do when feeling massive vulnerability shame. i find that people who aren't avoidant don't understand where i'm coming from. i genuinely just need non-judgmental reassurance because i am \~losing my mind\~. thank you for all of the compassion i've received from the subreddit in the past.

471,{fa}{da} How can I learn to be more comfortable with other people’s emotions?,"Fa, leaning da here (mostly da in friendships, fa in romance). One of the big surprises I’ve had in therapy/attachment studies is that I myself am pretty emotionally unavailable and thus have almost exclusively interacted with emotionally unavailable people.

I’m trying to keep space open for when men specifically open up to me about their emotions (I’m a lot better handling things with women). This is so I can be a better, more loving friend. But also so I can develop a relationship with an emotionally available man rather than the robots and narcissists I’ve dated previously.

I thought I was doing really well in this front recently. But then the other night I was hanging out with a friend I recently reconnected with from years ago. We used to have good heart to hearts and I helped him through some heavy shit around 8 years ago, where we’ve both seen each other cry and have supported each other. This most recent time we were hanging out we had a heart to heart and he started crying because of what we were talking about, some relationship stuff he was dealing with, and an unexpected death in the family recently. I just… didn’t know what to do. I had a really hard time, like I had to force myself to make eye contact when appropriate because I didn’t want to be dismissive, especially because the conversation started as him giving me encouragement about my own things I was practically in tears over a bit earlier. In the past I would’ve held his hand or given him a hug, as I would with any of my friends, but I just felt frozen in this. I felt so uncomfortable and when he asked for a hug, I did it but I didn’t want to. 

I don’t know how I can hold more space for people to open up to me in the ways I try to open up to them. I want this type of emotional connection in my life like I used to be able to handle. But I felt disgusted after, which makes me feel like a horrible person. I love my friend, I care deeply about him, and he’s been a great friend to me. I’m doing a lot of somatic work myself to learn to feel my emotions and work through past traumas, and a lot of what he was saying while crying was actually supposed to be an encouragement to me just as much as it was to himself. Maybe it felt too intimate, whereas in the past it didn’t feel that way? I don’t know.

Any feedback or advice or shared stories would be appreciated!",11q1r3m,29,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/11q1r3m/fada_how_can_i_learn_to_be_more_comfortable_with/,AvoidantAttachment,0
472,Unable To Fall In Love {FA} {DA leaning},"I’ve been struggling for the past 10 years with feeling unable to fall in love. I’ve read a lot about limerance and the honeymoon stage and think I am really starting to understand what different feelings are. In general I have developed feelings of limerance with entirely unavailable people (either we go on one date or they string me along for years as their alternative person). On the other hand, I have dated people whom, in retrospect, I was just not very attracted to, out of a sense of obligation. I have never had a honeymoon phase in a relationship and I would really like to. One time three years ago I went on four dates with someone where I felt, for the first time, like I was starting to develop a healthy attraction and she shared that she was, too. That ended abruptly because I was moving and she didn’t want to start something only to have it become long distance. I tried to date a bit after that, and then took 3 years off dating because I had a lot of other things going on. Since starting up dating again, i am right back to getting myself into relationships out of a sense of obligation rather than genuine attraction. I feel insane and completely unable to break this cycle. I’ve done a lot of trauma work and therapy over the past  5 years, but it hasnt seemed to help much.

473,How do you communicate your needs or even identify them? {fa},"After my relationship ending, I really started learning about attachment style and realized how I’ve been showing up in all aspects of my life. I also started noticing how heavily avoidant I am. I know this stems from childhood trauma and after seeking therapy and trying to change, my mom has been super supportive and trying to repair our relationship. 

I started setting boundaries in our relationship so for example, she cursed at me and I said I won’t continue the conversation if she speaks to me like that. Well my whole life if I spoke up, she would just get mad at me, shift the blame, never apologize, and would pretend like nothing happened. This time, she actually sent me a well-written, genuine apology and said she would respect me. Now at this first glimpse of healthy communication from my mom, I literally didn’t know what to do with myself LOL. I was so used to the avoidance that her apologizing to me led me to hide away and not respond to her apology. She then asked me if I read her message and I said yes and thanked her for apologizing. But now I’m realizing that when someone is trying to do better or try for me, my immediate response is to run away. 

We also watched “Stutz” on Netflix and there’s a scene where Jonah is talking to his mom and they discuss needs. My mom then proceeds to say, “I think we need to identify our needs in our relationship. What do you need from me?” I had no idea how to respond and just laughed it off. She is trying so hard, I’m grateful, and I know this is an effort most parents would never make. But now facing each other is really hard and sometimes I miss the lack of communication. 

I then thought about it later and had no idea what my needs are. Also whenever I want to communicate with someone, I just tear up immediately or avoid talking at all costs. Does anyone have examples of needs in a relationship and how to communicate/identify them? I have no idea what to ask from a parent or what I “need”.

474,Just found out {da},"I have just started talking with a psychologist about my problems. During the conversations she asked me what the closest emotional moment was I had with my mother and the only thing I could think of was her helping me with homework and that she cooked for me. She is a nice woman but we just never talk about emotional things. We just talk about other stuff like politics, sports or some other things that don't really involve feelings. When I was little my father (not in my life anymore) used me as a weapon against her. I was told that there were times he held me by my leg outside of a window when I was little (3 stories high) and threaten my mother that he would drop me. He did all kind of crazy stuff so you get the picture of what a happy little family we were.

The reason I started talking with this psychologist was my girlfriend, she wanted me to go because she felt I had never let her come close after 5 years and she could not take it anymore. We broke up and she wants to try again in the future after I get some help. The stuff my psychologist says to me make sense to me (when grandparents died I hid under my bed instead of getting close with family, had problems with my study at my university and lied about it to everyone because I thought I would eventually get my stuff together and did not want to talk about it with other people) but some things just make no sense to me.

If I really am so avoidant why do I still miss my now ex girlfriend and do want us to work? If I really am so avoidant why did I listen to her and went to therapy? I feel like I genuinely care about her and miss her so that just does not rhyme with being avoidant. If I really were so avoidant this would be perfect, I now don't see her and we call once a week, I got all the space that I could ever wish for but this does not make me happy. I am very curious about your experiences and hope that maybe I can learn something from them.

476,Am I deactivating or not interested in him? {fa},"FYI I never had a relationship,  I usually sabotaged them by dating unavailable men. 

Now I am dating someone who is available, we share many interests and values, and connect intellectually and sexually, he is very present emotionally and has  great influence on me. 
But... I don't know if I like him. In the beginning, I found myself swinging more or just generally confused. Now, the negative out weights the positive. He hasn't done anything wrong.
But I feel disgust or anger towards him at times. 
I just don't feel close to him at all,  not even as a friend I'd like to depend on him. 
Then recently he told me that he told me about wanting to adopt his niece,  I understand his motives perfectly. But I now I completely lost interest in him. I don't want to speak to him anymore and just cut him off..  I also want to move abroad and realized our plans might not be compatible anyways. 
But I want to discuss these things with perspective and know what I'm actually feeling..in the beginning I swore to myself to put the work and not sabotage this, because objectively he seems to be a great guy for me. 

My feelings are just confusing. I don't know what I'm feeling towards him, and when I have an emotional outburst like just now, I don't know why. But maybe these are related?

I caught myself feeling highly anxious. I immediately shut it down, and coped in ways that turned me back avoidant. I do this all the time, but this is the first time I realized that if I didn't do this, or go through what I went through to become an avoidant, I would be a highly anxious attachment style.

478,{FA} My emotions feel like a monster I have to hide,"I (27F) have been in my first relationship for about a year now. I'm with a partner who I've talked with about attachment theory. He tested DA overall, but secure with me-- and shares that he feels secure with me too. I've been working on my attachment for years now working through my own trauma. I think I've been doing OK overall, trying not to act on my insecurity. I've been actually being honest about my feelings when I'm struggling, which was really scary at first and I didn't want to open up at all. But now that I have been vulnerable I feel like I've pushed past my dismissive feelings and am feeling the anxiety (or fear?) hardcore. 

I've been having a hard time recently with work stress, and I've been honest with him about it. Although I used to want space alone when I'm stressed, I'm actually starting to want to be with him when I'm struggling, which is super weird for me and also SCARY. Because I realize now that I'm vulnerable and I'm having so many anxious thoughts, like: ""what if I'm overwhelming him?"" ""what if I'm burdening him?"" ""What if I'm not able to be a good partner for him because I'm struggling right now and I make him feel bad?"" and ultimately-- ""what if he leaves me?"" which used to be a thought that didn't scare me that much at the beginning of our relationship when I was leaning more DA. But now I'm feeling very fearful.

I know that this is definitely coming from my attachment trauma. When I was growing up I was responsible for my mom's feelings, which she expressed in really volatile and scary ways. At the same time I wasn't allowed to express feelings, so I buried them to attend to hers. I'm much more in touch with my feelings now after work in therapy, but I'm still pretty scared of them when they show up. I think I fear becoming my mom. Logically I know that I'm not. When I express my feelings to my partner I mostly just cry, talk about how I feel, ask for a hug and then I usually feel much better. He's so sweet and such a great listener. The physical touch really calms me too.

479,"{fa} Was there a pinnacle turning point when you thought ""okay...I'm ready for a relationship"" ?","Edit: skip to ""QUESTIONS HERE"" if you just want to read the question.

_


I (30m) broke things off recently with a girl (29f) (after 3 months) who I believe had no red flags, I found her out of my league gorgeous and we were seemingly very compatible. (It had been a long time since I found someone like this)

However.... I couldn't shake this consistently chronic feeling of stress, The prevailing thought being that I hadn't experienced enough when it came to dating, that I wasn't comfortable in myself and I didn't feel like I could commit to a long term relationship.  

I started feeling this stress almost immediately after we started dating, then connected it to my feelings of being inexperienced a few weeks later. 

I gave it as much time as I could without dragging my heels to the point it was unfair. I was open with her about my commitment issues. I tried speaking to a therapist, some meditation, online research, going for long walks with no music but I couldn't shake the feeling that I needed to get out there and accomplish some things in my single life before moving into a relationship. 

So after a while of trying to get over this feeling and settle into a relationship (I had lost 5kg from stress) it felt like the right time to pull the plug.

We ended things on good terms, there was honesty and kindness all around but I found it very painful still. 
It's been just short of a month since the break up.

The thing is...  These fantasies of what I imagine I want to accomplish in my single life.... I don't even know if I really need/want to do them, and they're especially difficult to pursue whilst I miss this girl. 

I've experienced a very similar situation before, So I'm recognizing a pattern here. Things started .. I got unbelievably stressed, something wasn't working (compatibility issue), I broke things off, then couldn't stop thinking about them for years. 

ANYWAY ... I'm back to working on myself but with a lot more purpose this time, reading, going through work sheets, journalling, talking with a therapist. I'm also going on dates as that seemed to be the reason I wanted to break up .... It's been about a month since the break up.

or does it not work like that and am I just hoping for a moment of enlightenment that will never come?

Are these valid reasons for breaking up or is it purely attachment?

480,Staying out of relationships altogether? {DA}?,"(Obligatory: this is a throwaway)  
To be honest, I find it very hard to sort myself into either the DA or the FA camp, because I feel I have characteristics of both. But from my experience, when I am in a relationship, I act more on the DA side after a while. I need a lot alone-time and I feel the ""obligation"" to make time for a partner on a regular basis getting too much for me pretty quickly. 

Now, I have some other issues as well, which make it a bit difficult for me to get into a relationship or be intimate with someone (one of which is, that I am most definitely on the demi-/grey-sexual scale and might lean towards aromanticism).

BUT... my question is... are there any people on here, who choose to stay out of a relationship, because they are (dismissive) avoidant? 

I've basically been living celibate for two years now, no romance, no hook-ups, no making out, because I am not super interested in all of this and I rarely crush on someone. But when I do, the feelings are mutual and I start some kind of relationship with someone, I always get this urge to flee, to get out of whatever kind of relationship has developed after a few weeks.

So now there is a person, who might be interested in me and I am crushing on them. And I just can't solve the problem of ""I kinda want them and they kinda want me, but it'll just end as it always does, so I better not get into anything with them"". 

How would some of you solve that? Do you wait it out, until the crush ends? Do you give it a try? Do you try to get the crush out of your head as fast as possible? How do you navigate that?

481,*NEW* Breakup Thread for Avoidant Attachers {DA} {FA},"The mods would like to do a trial run of a Breakups Thread specifically for those who have an avoidant attachment style. Usually, the breakup posts that are removed are largely focused on an avoidant ex instead of the avoidant's own avoidant attachment, which doesnt really fit in to the goal or rules of this sub (to learn about and talk about our own attachment style). Instead of cutting this topic off completely, we'd like to offer a space where breakup issues that aren't allowed in regular posts to still have a place. This is sort of like the Monthly Relationship Thread, except this is for avoidants only. Putting it in a separate, labelled thread will allow users to easily skip over it if they are not interested in it, and will also make it easy for those seeking it to find.

As this is still the Avoidant Attachment sub, and this is a pro-avoidant sub, no hate, dehumanizing comments, or other rude behavior toward avoidant people will be tolerated. There are ways to express your frustration without generalizing our attachment style as a whole or just being plain nasty.

Details that would be helpful to include in your post/comment include:

- What are you looking for - vent/rant, advice, commiseration? Please be clear so you can get the assistance you want

- What type of relationship was it, what was the duration?

We'll see how this goes! If it becomes a shit show, we will stop it all together. We wanted to give an opportunity for this topic to be discussed in a civil and helpful manner. 

As always, if someone is responding to your post being rude, not being pro-avoidant, other emotional dumping instead of providing support, etc, please report.

2) Do you think this has any correlation to your attachment style/relationship dynamics as an adult?

3) When it comes to relational dysfunction, what kind of core wounds come up for you? (As in, the automatic beliefs that stop you from getting close to someone. I have a theory about which ones relate to enmeshment but I’ll hold them until later to see if it’s true).

487,What’s your gender? {DA},"I had a conversation this weekend that inspired me to ask this question.  I made the point (to someone who doesn’t know about AT) that the behaviors I exhibit in relationships are the “stereotypically masculine” ones. I was making this point because it was a nature v nurture type conversation, and I think American culture (where I’m from) emphasizes the narrative that DA behaviors are “just how men are”. But I’ve met AP men too, etc… I would hypothesize that gender identity and attachment style only align in as much as we culturally socialize our kids to behave certain ways due to their biological sex. (I was taking the side of nurture. My conversational partner was taking the side of nature).

Anyway, I get the impression the people on this sub are actually predominantly women… What do you identify as?

For me, I’m a woman, though I’ve historically identified as gender fluid too. I wonder if my relationship to a more “masculine” cultural norm has led me to feel this way?

489,I have a fear of intimacy and I don't know how I can fix it? {da},"I guess I should say why I feel this way about intimacy. In short I believe I don't deserve anything and no one owes me anything. 

The same goes as vise versa that I don't owe anything to anybody, but still this is a subconscious behavior that's very toxic. 

I have 2 main things that are causing me this, the fear of them hurting me and me hurting them. Let's start with the latter.

Why do I believe that I cause harm to others? 

Well I believe Im using people to fix me, I do not want to open up about my problems because they're mine alone to deal with. My friend, my family member, or my partner did not sign up to a relationship with baggage and be my free therapist which I vent all my problems/emotions to.

Everyone has their own mental health problems that they deal with, I'm not special. Nobody needs to drop everything they're doing to support me and whatever I may go through.

It causes less pain and drama overall. I just don't want to be a burden to others at all. 

 I'm hurting others by distancing myself from them. The fact that I even try to interact with others is selfish when I should focus on my mental health first before heading into a new relationship when I'm not ready for it. 

I also feel as if they'll have high expectations for me to meet and I'm afraid I might not be able to meet for them. That they'll think I'm somehow interesting or have my life together and they'll start to see how much of a mess I really am. That I don't deserve the love they give me because I'm a cheat and a fraud that's their time and attention.

Hell how do I even know if I would truly want to be in a long term relationship with a partner and down the line I realize I don't want it. They don't deserve that! In fact how do I even know what I want or what my values are? They don't need to wait nor deserve to wait to figure out what I actually want?! 

So I don't want to flake out on anybody because nobody deserves to deal with my attachment style or insecurities. So basically I'm afraid of being selfish.

The 2nd thing is my fear of being hurt by others.

I do not want to rely on anyone for my happiness. They at any time can be manipulative or betray me, conditional love is a flimsy thing that has no guarantees and that uncertainty scares me.

I'm afraid of them talking behind my back or only using me to get what they want. I'm afraid of them putting me down for what I am or wish to be. I don't want to put my expectations up for them not to hurt me because I know everyone comes and goes like seasons. So why put my eggs in one basket?

But in the end I realize this is just me being paranoid, my logical side knows that I'm being cynical and this is just my way of shutting down any possibility to be close to others or even wish for it. I self sabotage whenever I get the chance and I wish I didn't.

So how in the hell do I change?!?!!? It feels impossible, no matter how much I try I just keep digging my grave deeper and deeper and I don't know how to get out.",syfr9q,28,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/syfr9q/i_have_a_fear_of_intimacy_and_i_dont_know_how_i/,AvoidantAttachment,0

492,My DA Progress,"Took a step back from AT to work on myself outside of that lens.

Things that I've discovered:

* My parents had an anxious-avoidant relationship. It was fairly known within my family that dad doesn't receive love the way he wants (physical touch, words of affirmation I think) from my mother or myself.
* I have/had a mother wound. My mom is incredibly avoidant and we are very similar aside from her being quite apathetic and me being moderately empathetic. We have an established good relationship now but she's never been quite happy and she's especially never been sure if she's happy in a relationship.
* I know its difficult for me to express my wants/needs because my parents very much so taught me to have none.
* I still have a lot of dismissive behaviors and views engrained in me that others take offensively (e.g. unfriending people on social media super nonchalantly, being too direct and casual during confrontation). I need to continue to work on my tact.
* I'm ok that intimacy and vulnerability does not come easy to me as I've been open to it but I still don't often feel it. 
* I think non-confrontational and all of these strategies for conversations are overwhelming and I do not like them nor do I think they work very well on people with actual avoidant issues. 
* I'm still only open to the spectrum of casual relationships. I went on a date recently with a secure (he described his journey of healing his attachment style) who wants a monogamous relationship. He checked all boxes and some rare nice to haves but I felt I did not wish to see him again.
* I am open to getting to know people (slow burn) vs natural chemistry (I don't experience limerence) but I am not going to force myself to get to know people if my body doesn't tell me to because its not a need.
* I enter relationships for awesome sex and connection. As it turns out, I am not a very complex creature. No need to be overly involved in each others lives; my best friends aren't so why should my partner be.
* Surprisingly, I am more of a ""feeling"" person than a ""thinking"" person than I thought. As in, I've been using thinking to navigate throughout my life and been ignoring my feeling because I didn't trust myself which is the polar opposite of what I've believed to be true.

494,How can you trust your feelings in order to make tough decisions about your relationships?,"
I’m sure this has been discussed, but this uncertainty is paralyzing me and I could really use some advice. 

If fear of intimacy can really cause you to lose feelings for someone (deactivation) than how can you ever know if you are have fallen out of love or if you are just afraid?

How are you supposed to trust yourself to make decisions in life if you can’t be sure if your feelings are “real” or if they are manifested by trauma? 

I feel gaslit by attachment theory. I want to break up with my partner because I’ve grown out of this relationship and want to be independent. But then attachment theory is telling me that that feeling is invalid because it is really just my fear of intimacy. 

How in the world can you ever know? 

Half of the advice I get is “trust your gut!”
The other half says “your trauma rules your emotions, you can’t trust them!”

I consider them super safe and I even feel myself gravitating towards them a little more than usual. Not necessarily to talk. Just to be in their presence silently while watching a film or something. This person is a super soother for me. I have a respectfully distant but very positive relationship with my family who I visit a couple times a month. I saw them recently. I'm kinda not mentally present when I'm there with them but hopefully I'm acting normally.

People are starting to pick up on my absence and have begun to check in. I'm self aware and emotionally mature so my feeling on this is ping ponging between ""thats very kind of them"" to ""I'd really like to be just left alone now"" to ""goddamn, just fuck off"". Apathy is on the rise but not necessarily negativity when I'm unbothered by others.

In general, I'm having a hard time feeling much. I might even say I feel kind of content though kinda bored?

I can definitely see how much more agitated and pushed into reclusion I'd be if I had someone prying at me.

EDIT: This is my chart: [https://snipboard.io/cSCpE2.jpg](https://snipboard.io/cSCpE2.jpg). I don't have a partner though. Had to think about the last couple relationships when I took it. They were DAs.

496,"Treating ""badly"" people who I care the most. Can you relate? {FA}","I was wondering recently where does this feeling come from. I tend to shut down people who mean the most to me. Whether it's family or one of my few closest friends, I don't usually show a lot of love towards them, and when they try to do cute things or show affection, they don't get a proper reaction from me.

i.g.: I live far away from my family for almost... 15 years now, lol. Yet, I tend to get weirdly angry when my mom texts me. She does it every couple of days, saying nothing new, just to make sure I'm fine, just checking if I'm alive or try to engage in a conversation. While I know, rationally, this is perfectly nice and acceptable, and means she cares about me, I don't want to reply to her texts. I always get this feeling she thinks I'm a little bit depressed, so her checking on me sounds like a vigilante move just to reinforce that I'm down. / My step father and my sister whom I love very much... we barely text or speak to eachother. I do miss them, but I don't feel the need to reach them. And they tend to leave me more alone. I talk on the phone with my father maybe once every 3 months, best scenario.

But my mom, who actually shows (and kind of forces?) how much she cares about me, cause me to react badly. I don't actually mistreat her, but I'm flat or cold. It's not that I don't like her, because I actually do, but I don't feel the need or will to reciprocate her attention or receive her care.

Can anybody relate to this feeling?",15i7ubm,28,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15i7ubm/treating_badly_people_who_i_care_the_most_can_you/,AvoidantAttachment,0
497,Fear around joining clubs or teams {fa},"Lately I have wanted to get out and meet new people, but the idea of going to a meetup or joining a club or hobby group fills me with dread.

I like the idea of socializing and being a part of something, but the idea of being stuck doing an activity with people for a predetermined amount of time makes me feel ill. 

I really struggle with wanting to collaborate or do group projects as well. It's not that I don't like other people's ideas or that I don't want to work with them, it's that I always feel like I will be overtaken, I will lose my voice and feel suffocated by other people who are more outspoken or assertive than I am.

I feel like the only way for me to feel safe in a situation is to do it by myself. All of my hobbies are solo activities. I cycle by myself, hike with my dog by myself, I swim by myself.

I feel more relaxed and at ease that way.

498,Do I stay or do I go? How do you know if the feeling to run should be listened to? {da},"I’m a 32 year old male DA and have been in a relationship for 3 years.

I’m being given the ultimatum to get married or break up.

Obviously this is the worst thing possible for a DA.

She is 4 years younger and has fallen into an insecure attachment style with me. Apparently she wasn’t this in the past and I bring this out of her... (yay...).

Some days I wake up and think *just do it. It’s a more meaningful life.*

Some days I wake up and everything in my body screams at me to run.

This is torture for me but the worst part is how much I’m hurting her.

Perhaps marriage and kids would help her reach a more secure attachment style. Or perhaps she will always find something that triggers her which triggers me and the negative cycle begins.

Outside of our attachment styles the relationship is great apart from me wanting more time to myself and less time being dragged to social and family events.",1147n6y,27,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/1147n6y/do_i_stay_or_do_i_go_how_do_you_know_if_the/,AvoidantAttachment,0
499,Why am I {FA} running away from safe men?,"Hi everyone,

I've been fortunate enough to meet very safe men recently and I've noticed I keep running away. These are guys who really want to get to know me for who I am, we get vulnerable and then all of a sudden alarms in my body start ringing and I end the connection.

The guys I've met provide me with laughter, vulnerability, closeness and understanding but something just never feels right inside. I've posted about one in here before and everyone said they'd love to be with him but for some reason I'm scared of him because of how vulnerable I can  feel around him.

The funny thing is I know it's vulnerability that I'm scared of but for some reason he had these eyes and look on his face where if something bugs me you know he wants to listen and care for you and I'd tell him anyways. It's obvious a kind gesture but I always felt like shit after.

500,Emotional breakthrough {FA},"I will try not to go into too much detail (so this doesn't become 10 pages long) but I had a pretty big emotional breakthrough this week. And by that I mean \*feeling\* some *actual emotions* that underly some of the *intellectual analysis* I have had on lock for like 12 years. Turns out, you gotta feel the emotions even if you understand every possible theoretical psycho-social construct that created a certain event/dynamic/whathaveyou. I feel like I'm actually capable of effecting change with the emotions actually on the table.

So... long story short my partner and I got into a classic anxious/avoidant fight. It's his birthday, I was trying to do everything possible to make it special and spending a ton of time/money/energy on everything, he zeroed in on ONE little thing that I wasn't going to be able to do for it that he preferred and felt like it represented a lack of care, I felt like ""I can never be or do enough for you"" and so on and so on.

But this also came on a week where, for some reason, I spontaneously wrote a letter to one of my best friends I've had in adulthood. I didn't send it, and it's likely I won't, but she suddenly bailed on our friendship and disowned me almost 8 years ago, and despite multiple earnest efforts on my end to at least have a conversation about it over the course of a year, she always refused. She never showed any curiosity about my experiences or interpretations, my feelings, anything—she just decided I was ""bad"" because I hurt her feelings in a few ways during a very difficult time in my life, and bailed.

The combo of writing that letter and having this fight brought up a LOT and I've been very emotional and weepy, and have been opening up to my partner about my experiences and inner world.

Basically, I perpetually end up getting closest with people who have very high expectations of me. They're very unforgiving of mistakes, and intolerant of discord, disagreements, or conflicting needs. If I have a need or limit that conflicts with what they want, I am bad. I am selfish. I am cruel. Pretty minor miscommunications/misinterpretations/hiccups get turned into reasons to banish me indefinitely from their world.

I have literally dozens of examples of this pattern.

One very strong one (again, among many) is my sister. She's SO HARSH. Many people have actually told me that they're frightened of her. We were always extremely close, in part because I was extremely distant from both of my parents and she was all I had emotionally. There are countless stories demonstrating our dynamic... but a recent one has really gotten under my skin. I was at her house with my partner, her kids watching TV, and we both commented very casually on how weird children's television is these days, I said ""god kids tv is so frightening"" — which, to me, it is! It's very bizarre and off-putting to me. It's an opinion. Three months later, my sister came to me crying and shaking, saying ""how incredibly awful it was"" for me to say such a thing. That if I weren't blood-related, her and her husband would've never invited me back or spoken to me again. She said she told all of her friends and they were all horrified at my insensitivity and incredible social ineptitude. Basically, she presented her case to me that I'm terrible, and laid out all of the evidence she'd gathered. I'm honestly baffled by this. But, at the time, I thanked her for telling me, apologized, explained what I meant by what I said (which was, surprise surprise, not what she read into it), and said I'm working on my communication skills—because I am. So all of that was true. Unfortunately, I then started crying and shame-spiraling, wondering ""what's wrong with me,"" and she just encouraged me to keep working on it.

It was only months later that I've reached how I now feel about this situation: furious.

If I made a comment that rubbed her the wrong way, why did she A) wait three months to confront me about it, letting resentment build the whole time and telling everyone about how awful I was, B) come to me with condemnation and rip me to shreds, rather than just telling me how she felt and leaving space for me to respond and explain...

But this is so incredibly ubiquitous in my enitre life! And unfortunately, I can now see, because it was so prominent early in my life, it's kind of become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'm defended in tone when I present my own needs and boundaries, which causes people to respond to them in very extreme ways. A lot of my avoidance in the first place just came from keeping people far away from me, because the only way I felt like I wasn't walking on eggshells and walking a tightrope set by someone else was to be alone. I choose people who have these personality traits (lack of emotional regulation, unable to take accountability/see their role, higher expectations for me than of themselves or anyone else, etc.). I've lost five very close friends and probably a few, if not all, of my relationships due to this stuff.

What I'm coming to at this point is a bit of a: FUCK THAT. I'm not kicking people out of my life anymore or keeping them out. That hurt too much. I've done a lot to rework my avoidant tendencies and I feel closer and closer to secure. BUT, no. People don't get to blame me unilaterally anymore. They don't get to treat me harshly. They don't get to disregard my side of things. If they want me, they have to be adults toward me. I'm not going to let myself be the scapegoat anymore. I'm not going to let myself be the punching bag. I'm going to keep working on my defensive tone and letting people close to me—but they are not allowed to lash out at me anymore. This has to end. And I had to feel the hurt of all of it this week, to actually cry and weep and shake and emote, to get here.",ykh84p,26,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ykh84p/emotional_breakthrough_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
501,I feel like my body stops functioning properly when I’m around a partner {FA},"Ok this is a bit of a weird post. But I’ve noticed that when I spend time with any partner (eg whether they’re someone I’ve dated for years, friends with benefits, or casual encounters) it feels like my body stops functioning normally. 

I basically have zero appetite (when usually day to day I’m alwaysss hungry). If I have anything to eat or drink I feel overly full and sick. No bowel movements even if I spend like 3-4 days with them. My sleep is terrible, I wake up exhausted no matter how familiar I am with them or if we cuddle or not. Also, with sex with the vast majority of partners I find it impossible to orgasm. By myself I can get myself off within a few minutes. But even if a partner asks me to get myself off in front of them then I just can’t at all. I don’t even get close. 

I don’t really know why this happens. It kind of makes me feel like I’d never be cut out for living with someone or spending extended amounts of time with a partner. I don’t get like this around friends. 

It just makes me think maybe I feel like deeply anxious or something whilst spending time with partners? Am I just not comfortable? Or too in my head? Is that what is causing it? 

Was curious whether this could be attachment related and whether anyone else experiences this. Or whether it’s just unrelated.",xd93ik,27,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/xd93ik/i_feel_like_my_body_stops_functioning_properly/,AvoidantAttachment,0
502,{fa} Any other avoidants have a lot of trouble initiating/showing affection?,"FA here - in a committed relationship of about 6 months now that has been overall very good. I have been heavily avoidant for most of my life, although I do become more anxious when in a relationship. I have done a lot of work on my attachment over many years and have become much more secure in my relationship. 

I've noticed over the last several months that I really struggle with initiating displays of affection. I can accept them happily and can add on to them (Say I love you back when he says it first), but trying to start them is really scary for me. This extends even to things as simple as wanting to give him a kiss when we're lying in bed together. I get so in my head about being rejected or him thinking it's weird or over the top that I often don't do anything.

I've gotten much more in touch with my emotions in this relationship and have immense positive regard (robot speak for love) for my boyfriend. I sometimes just want to spontaneously express that but it's TERRIFYING for some reason.

This precipitated specifically tonight because he and I spent the weekend away together and I now have a busy week ahead of me so we're not going to see each other the rest of the week. We typically see each other 1-2 times during the work week and then spend the weekend together so it's a little longer than we're both used to. I was just feeling tonight that I missed him and would really like to be cuddled up with him and wanted to text him that and that I loved him, just kind of out of the blue. But the thought of being ""rejected"" or being seen as ""clingy"" or ""too much"" or ""weird"" for that has made it incredibly difficult for me to send that message. I don't have any expectation (except not to be rejected for sending the message I guess). I just want to express something sweet that I'm feeling. Why is that so hard for me?

There's also an avoidant tendency that is somewhat like - wtf, why do I miss him after only 48 hours? I never used to be like that. And it's not a desperate missing, I just would like it if he were here. That's all. But that feeling freaks me out. 

Has anyone experienced this and have some insight? I can't tell if this is me fighting against old avoidant tendencies (I would NEVER have missed someone period, much less after only 2 days before) or if this is a fear of enmeshment or my anxious side coming out.",ww3ui0,27,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ww3ui0/fa_any_other_avoidants_have_a_lot_of_trouble/,AvoidantAttachment,0

506,{fa}+{fa}: Deactivation versus legitimate concerns about incompatibility?,"Without going into specifics of my relationship, I'm curious about how other people with avoidant attachment styles in adult relationships distinguish between a deactivated state versus a clear signal that the relationship isn't working.

Both ""states"" seem to be marked by an emotional ""signal"" to pull away but at this stage in my journey of understanding of my (and my partner's) FA style, I feel utterly lost as to what's actually going on for me in reading these emotional signals.

The inquiry for me becomes: ""Am I experiencing the emotional intrusion of my old attachment wounding from childhood or am I getting clear signals that we are simply incompatible?"".

I do know I am experiencing feelings of being trapped or stuck in a situation where my needs aren't being met.

This creates a stalemate and a polarisation: I can't get ""all in"" to a relationship where I feel my needs won't be met. She feels my subtle distancing and so pulls back a bit herself which only confirms to me that I can't be fully met by her, and so on.

We both feel stuck at present. We also are both very sensitive to our ""connection status"" — it feels like we are walking a tightrope: satisfying when we are balanced (connected) but it all feels very shaky and anxious when the connection is disrupted. The resulting distance between us is unsettling for both of us and coming back into connection becomes problematic and feels difficult. We get very stuck processing what is going on for each of us and it feels heavy.

507,Still So Avoidant! | {SA} {DA},"Quick little one with some observations this morning. 

I’m starting to experience that earned security is a bit different than inherent security. Probably with time and effort it will become more natural for me, but I’m endeared by my own lingering behaviors. 

I’ve had a pretty eventful couple of weeks. Went on a date to see what it was like and push myself a little, started opening dialogue about possible interest in continuing with an ex I still care about, expressed to a guy I met while out that I thought he was cute and got his number. 

But the ways I’m showing up in these events are still so hilariously avoidant. On the date, I was discerning and realized he wouldn’t be a good partner. (Leaving town soon, he wants marriage and monogamy and kids. I’m open to monogamy with the right person but I definitely don’t want children). I had fun with him, he was sweet, but I definitely didn’t feel like doing affectionate gestures. He asked about holding hands and I said I wasn’t comfortable (LOL). But I also explained why, that I don’t feel safe opening up to someone who’s about to leave anyway. This dance of secure and avoidant behavior, back and forth…

And my ex, I’m very proud of him. He expressed interest recently -in his own limited way- without me really prompting him. I keep telling myself it’s ok to slowly go there, to ease into discussing things in a real and forthright manner… but boy it’s like pulling teeth for both of us. I continue to give what I can in conversation… But also I’ll send that text right before bed and then turn off notifications for his texts so I don’t have to be hypervigilant all night and see if he’s replied.

Then, this guy I met. He’s cool, super my type, probably not a viable partner but you don’t know until you really vet people. And trying to connect is the way out of an avoidant rut. He gives me his number Saturday night and tells me to text him that night. It took me until this morning to actually text. Four days later. And it’s nothing to do with his value as a person!! Again I pulled my “mute notifications for this number” power move so I can handle the anxiety and check when I’m ready. Tough. 

Damn! It’s clear why so many self reject and sabotage. If I weren’t actively aware of myself, if I weren’t determined to do the healthier thing every time, I’d have just given up and remained in stasis forever.",u8pqvg,26,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u8pqvg/still_so_avoidant_sa_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
508,"Just avoidant things - how do you all deal with the ""emotional hangover"" of being vulnerable or opening up (especially if it wasn't especially well-received)? {FA}","I currently work in mental healthcare as an intern, and yesterday, we had our required weekly meeting.

Our supervisor recently made it a requirement that we have to present on a psychological topic of our choosing (one of us presenting each week) during this meeting. Unsurprisingly, someone chose attachment theory yesterday. No big deal. However, they threw a curve ball by making each group member disclose their attachment style, as well as their current or most recent partner's attachment style. Oof.

Now, due to my avoidant side, I generally *hate* discussing my personal/romantic life with colleagues (unless we have a genuine rapport/friendship), especially when essentially forced to, so I was instantly on edge about participating. I seriously considered just saying I'm secure (re: basically lying) and downplaying my unconventional/dysfunctional relationship history, but instead I was generally transparent that I'm FA with a secure lean, and my last partner was my long distance on-and-off DA (who also has strong secure tendencies), and that it ended due to the distance. That's basically all I said. I definitely didn't share the hairy details of that whole strange relationship. The group listened politely but moved on very quickly, almost like they were dodging further discussion about it (totally possible I imagined this due to how on edge I was). Nevertheless, it was a little weird and definitely awkward, especially since the group overwhelmingly presented themselves and their past/current partners as secure. And of course I was the only FA in the bunch.

Now I'm sitting here thinking that I shouldn't have even mentioned it, and now my fellow interns are going to think I'm emotionally unhealthy or negatively judge me or something (which I know, deep down, is mostly irrational). But this is how I *always* feel when discussing my romantic life/personal issues outside of the few people I've deemed ""safe"" in my mind. It's better when I'm very reinforced/supported when opening up, but when people completely gloss over my vulnerability or act indifferent or uncomfortable about it (or even worse, try to somehow ""fix"" it - a surprisingly common presumptuous reaction), it makes me really regretful I ever ""went there."" And then I just kind of marinate in a sense of shame and wishing I hadn't opened up at all.

To my fellow avoidants - do you relate? How do you deal with it? I'd love to hear perspectives from people in this boat.

**Edit**: Thank you all so much for your validating and comforting responses. I feel so much better about it and definitely agree it was in poor taste for the presenter to do this. Our supervisor watched this presentation and didn't see an issue with it, so I'm not sure if she would receive feedback regarding it well, but I may politely approach the presenter directly and ask that they not do that again (I know they meant well and probably genuinely had no idea how invasive this question actually was). I tend to really get in my own head after being vulnerable in any way so I'm glad I have you guys to set me straight when I'm ultimately resorting to maladaptive thought patterns and getting overly self conscious.

510,Can’t fall asleep in same bed as lovers,"Any other avoidants have this problem? Not sure if it’s connected to my attachment style (FA leaning), or a different kind of trauma. It just seems like my nervous system is too wired and hyper vigilant to fall asleep in the same bed, even with partners I’ve been with for months. It feels connected to a lack of trust, like my nervous system is on high alert bc I may be in danger (symptom of avoidant attachment - in bed is too intimate? My subconscious way of pushing them away, not letting my guard down?)

It may seem silly but it’s kind of the same feeling I have when I have guests - as a host, I have a reluctant welcoming of guests. I want to want to be a good host, but in reality my psyche interprets guests as an intrusion on my space/privacy and sense of boundaries and I can never quite relax. It comes down to feeling scared of intimacy I think. Or a fear of being rejected or judged or violated if I let my guard down. Whoa. I’m blowing my own mind with this connection.

FWIW, don’t have this sleeping problem with friends - I can usually fall asleep when sleeping in the same bed as friends.

511,My cat is somehow more secure than I am...,"When a cat lies on its back and shows you its belly, the cat is relaxed, comfortable, and doesn't feel threatened. It feels safe enough to expose its vulnerable areas without worrying about being attacked. 

My cat not only shows her belly to me, but she lets me rub it! Truly showing that she trusts me fully in a life or death situation. If she left out her belly in the wild she could've gotten bitten or pounced by a wild animal, being killed right there and then.

It really makes me just feel very dissapointed in myself because I'm not in a life or death situation with being in relationships wether that's romantic, platonic, or familial. I'm not gonna die if I get backstabbed by a friend, yeah sure it's gonna hurt alot. But my life isnt gonna end because of that, life will still go on wether I like it or not.

That's just a normal part of life, you're going to face betrayal eventually at one point in your life. You can't avoid being hurt by people forever because it is by nature unavoidable, unless you want to live forever alone in the woods. Then by all means go right ahead, but I still want human connection and intimacy.

In short: I act more cat like than my own cat.

Warning for up ahead: I might delete this later out of it being a vent and I'm usually not comfortable with that. 

Hahaha... Haha... ha.... Wow, I'm really just having a pity party for myself. Pretty pathetic, am I *right?* *Sigh* this is exactly why I hate venting my emotions.

512,Reframing,"I don't know what prompted this thought, but earlier I was thinking about how the word ""avoidant"" has a negative connotation and truly plays into the negative outlook towards those who are DA or FA. This seems especially true when avoidants are in relationships with someone more anxiously attached. 

""Avoid"" to me has a connotation of purposeful intent. I avoid streets that are super busy. I avoid obstacles in my path. I avoid interactions with people who have made me uncomfortable (not the best example, but you get it). I avoid making a phone call when I could text/email. Avoiding is a purposeful action in any other context *except* attachment style, where it is very much subconscious. 

My main thought earlier was wondering how many relationship dynamics would improve if people reframed their thinking. Instead of thinking/saying ""My partner is avoiding me because x"", what if we said ""My partner is protecting themselves because y."" Or anything similar. 

For example, I recently had such extreme anxiety because it felt like my boyfriend was pulling away and avoiding me while he was sick. I kept thinking ""He's avoiding seeing me because he doesn't love me anymore."" It was so damaging and I quickly fell into a spiral of building negative thoughts. Had I started telling myself ""My partner is protecting himself because he doesn't feel good."" or even ""My partner is protecting me because he doesn't want me to get sick."" There's such a different connotation to those phrases. 

Even in more every day situations. ""My partner avoids showing me affection because he doesn't love me"" can be turned into ""My partner is protecting himself from being hurt by perceived rejection."" To me, the transition helps to humanize the person doing the avoiding, as well as shift blame off of the people involved. 

I don't think you can actually reframe the attachment style label, although I know some have tried. But I just have to wonder if we start trying to reframe the behavior - even to our own selves - if that will have some improvement on us.",rvd023,27,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rvd023/reframing/,AvoidantAttachment,0
513,DBT Skills Series - Radical Acceptance,"Radical Acceptance is a Distress Tolerance DBT skill. It is meant to help deal with intense negative emotions in the moment. Often times we find ourselves angry, ruminating, or judging ourselves after a triggering event. The truth is that the intense negative emotions usually still exist.  ""Radical acceptance means fully accepting our reality and letting go of the bitterness. It refers to realizing that fighting what is already happening just leads to more pain.""

\*Step One: Think of an Important Event  
First, think of an important event in your life that you have a hard time accepting. It can be something from your present or a past event that you find yourself often revisiting. If you have experienced traumatic events, you might want to start out with something less overwhelming until you've done this exercise a few times. 

\*Step Two: What Caused the Event?  
Try to think of all the facts that led to this event. Try to be as objective as possible and not judge anyone involved. Don't judge something as good or bad. This exercise isn't meant to invalidate the pain of the event, but to help you process and move on. 

\*Step Three: Accepting the Feelings  
Try to notice what emotions are coming up for you based on the event. You might notice physical sensations in your body as well. It might be obvious, like racing heart or flushed face, or more subtle. Whatever you feel, try to name that emotion and accept it. Remind yourself that you can't change the event that has happened, but you can feel some relief by accepting the emotions that it brings up. 

\*Step Four: Proactive Plan  
The last step is to make a proactive plan to deal with this event going forward. If it affects you in a minimal way, practicing Radical Acceptance may be enough to help you come to terms with the event. If it affects you more deeply, you can try to come up with ways to improve the situation. Journaling may help with this, as well as some of the other DBT skills such as Wise Mind. 

Coping Statements - These statements help to remind you that you can't change past events. Repeating them can help you let go of negative emotions and thoughts related to events. Here is a list of helpful statements, but it can also be really beneficial to create your own. 

1. The present moment is the only one I have control over.
2. Fighting my current emotions and thoughts only gives them more fuel to thrive.
3. The present is a result of thousands of variables from the past.
4. This moment is precisely as it should be even though I might not like it.
5. I cannot change what has happened in the past.
6. I accept this moment as it is.
7. Although my emotions are uncomfortable, I will get through it.
8. It's not helpful for me to fight the past.

514,Therapy Breakthrough,"So last week I left work early on Monday and spent nearly 2 days in bed. I called in again on Wednesday and my boss literally said ""No, come work with your door closed. We know the flu is going around."" So I came to work and I spent the entire day being miserable, knowing I should have stayed home. It wasn't until my boyfriend said he wouldn't have come in that I even realized that hey, I'm an adult and I could've just said ""No."" 

The longer I thought about it, the more it bothered me. Why did I, a grown as 30 year old who knew I was too sick to come work, immediately give in and cave because someone of authority told me no? Initially I thought it was a boundary issue. I just don't have good boundaries. 

I brought it up in therapy. My therapist is really good about asking me questions to make me think/get me talking until I come to the breakthrough on my own. And I realized this is an inner child issue. There is some part of me that doesn't feel like I have power over my own life. That I have to listen to others, shut myself down and make myself small to avoid conflict. 

I don't ever remember being seen, heard, validated when I was a kid. Like, I can't think of a single instance where I felt that way. So I learned that people knew me better than me. When I tell you I don't feel good, and you invalidate that by saying ""come to work anyway"" I just shut down because I tried once and it didn't work. It's easier for me to pretend that I don't have wants, needs, or feelings than to stand up for myself. And shutting up is and doing what people tell me is apparently my way of getting validation from them - because it avoids conflict. It's easy to see how this plays into my general avoidance. 

The worst part of it all is that I don't know how to handle someone actually seeing me, hearing me, and validating me. My boyfriend I think does a pretty good job of this. I recently deactivated because I wasn't speaking up about a need I had. When I finally told him, he was very validating and understanding and then he actually met my need. But now I'm questioning how long before he stops. It's more suspicious to me that he actually showed he cares that it would have been if he didn't respond well. God, I'm so broken.

Anyway, I think it's a good sign that I was so uncomfortable by my boss' response. It shows that I'm learning myself more and learning what I will and won't tolerate. I think if something similar were to happen again, I would be better equipped to stand up for myself. Because I am fully allowed to validate myself even if those around me don't. 

And the realization that this is a response stemming all the way back from childhood helped me to see one of my boyfriend's behaviors as the same. He can be pretty pushy sometimes - like a toddler who tries to wear you down until you give in. I realized that maybe this is the only way he got his needs met during childhood - and it's his way of being seen, heard, validated. Next time I'm with him I plan to try to acknowledge and validate him while still honoring myself and seeing how that goes.",rfqdff,27,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rfqdff/therapy_breakthrough/,AvoidantAttachment,0
515,How does your attachment style impact the way you respond when someone DOESNT return your feelings?,"I think we talk a lot here about how our attachment styles cause us to respond when someone expresses interest in us (typically some version of de-activating).

I’m really curious, though, to hear how y’all find yourselves responding when someone doesn’t return your feelings.

I’m in that type of situation at the moment and I’m finding myself thinking about it obsessively trying to “read the signs” to find out exactly how he feels while avoiding his texts because I’m afraid they’ll remind me that he doesn’t care about me the way I care about him. Generally I’d say I’m “playing it cool” around him while slightly dying inside.

516,How does an avoidant react when you start to pull away?,"*Update (19 Sep)*: I think I had enough when he yesterday said sth like “Sorry I’ve a been a little quiet. Was thinking when I was on my run that I should’ve said I wanted some me time instead of going quiet.”

Then I said “ok thanks for telling me. I’m not sure how to react to this tho, sorry.” He left me on read.

20mins later I decided to send another text. “Eh, I’m not sure what’s going on. If you want to talk, let me know.” 

His reply: “thank you. 😊 I’m ok. Sorry maybe that came out wrong.” 

I just said “Alright. 🙂”

He left me on read again.

That was last night.

This morning I decided enough was enough. I really hated his communication style (or lack thereof). Was asking myself if I could hold out till Tuesday after seeing my therapist before breaking it off with him but I was getting too angry. So I went ahead and did it. Probably was the right choice, since he hasn’t responded lol. 

____________

Sigh. Anxiously attached gal here seeing an avoidant dude for about 5mths. Despite me asking several times “what are we” and wanting to label things, he’s given several reasons/excuses as to why he doesn’t want to do it. _E.g. label is just a label, I’m not sure about my future (he’s an expat), I take very long before being sure of someone etc etc._

Then recently he’s been VERY cold towards me, and so naturally, I decided to pull away too. Bc fuck it, I’m no longer chasing men who aren’t gonna be into it. In fact I’m contemplating calling it quits soon. I mean, it just stopped being fair when everything is on his terms (don’t want the label, don’t know this and that etc etc). 

Just curious, are avoidants affected or get sad when their partners stop reaching out as often? Or they just don’t care? I’ve tried to research this online but only found articles on the anxious-avoidant trap… (which I’m very familiar with by now and will finally break it lol).",pk5u4b,27,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/pk5u4b/how_does_an_avoidant_react_when_you_start_to_pull/,AvoidantAttachment,0

518,"Sometimes, we're just not into you","A lot of posts here are from individuals involved with a DA questioning whether or not the DA ran away because they feared their own feelings for the other person.

Sometimes that's true. But sometimes, its because we're not into you anymore.

Story by example:

Many years ago (when I was not self-aware), I happened to fall into a unexpected casual relationship for \~3 months. There were no DTR conversations; we were just seeing each other, being romantic together, going on dates, and sleeping together.

I was totally emotionally unavailable for a relationship and I think that was clear to the other person (due to my circumstances at the time) but he still wanted to pursue a relationship. When he brought it up, I realized we were on totally different pages and I faded out on him FAST in classic DA-style (probably seemed out of the blue). At this point, I did totally lose my feelings and soon after, I entered a very toxic relationship with an AP for about a year.

Some of you could say that I just deactivated on the guy and moved on before I could realize that. Quite bluntly, it didn't matter because in that time, **I lost absolutely all interest and I never regained it**. I did see him a couple times since then as friends catching up since I like him as a person.",o3grce,28,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/o3grce/sometimes_were_just_not_into_you/,AvoidantAttachment,0
519,Should I Keep Dating this Person?{FA} {DA},"I’ve never been in love before and historically I only develop strong feelings for people who are 95-100% unavailable.

I was attracted to her at first, but didn’t feel butterflies and I’ve never had those feelings for her that I want to have like a buzzing in my body and longing for her. But I absolutely LOVE spending time with her. We hang out about once a week and we can just talk for hours. We always go on cool adventures together, I love the way she thinks and views the world. I like how she treats people and I think she has an overall really awesome life. She also treats me well and brings me little gifts like wild flowers and fresh fruit. So cool. I think I triggered myself early on by not setting sexual boundaries and, not to get too graphic, but things were a little rougher than I’m comfortable with. I’ve since asked to be gentler and she changed immediately. She’s really cool. But I don’t feel much romantic or sexual attraction to her. I get turned on when I first see her. And then it goes away fast. I think she’s pretty, but I feel like my body is also a little scared of her. Is this just me not being romantically into her and maybe we should just be friends, or should I keep going and see if feelings grow?

521,Dismissive but also secure? Is that a thing? {DA}{SA},"I'm just writing this out as a way to figure myself out.

I think I definitely had dismissive and critical parents growing up. I learned I couldn't rely on them or trust them. I figured out later on that most of my family never listened to me. The one adult who really looked after me and gave a shit about me was my grandma but she passed when I was 16. Same year that my dog died.

For as long as I can remember, I've been super self reliant, independent, and very introverted. I can put on an extroverted act and I get along with most people. I have a lot of friends and a boyfriend. But at the end of the day I want to go home and be left the fuck alone.

Sometimes I have trouble asking for help. But usually it's because it either doesn't occur to me, or because I've found that most advice I get from other people is useless and unhelpful. I've gotten good at researching how to do a lot of things myself.

I'm not afraid of abandonment, rejection, or loneliness. I feel like I've experienced that so much in life that it can't hurt me anymore. Not much, anyway. I have no problem walking away from people who bother me.

I like the mental and friendship aspects of relationships. But sometimes the physical part puts me on edge. (I've been SA'ed in the past so it's a PTSD response, too.) I'm pretty sure my boyfriend wishes I wanted it more. We have good communication though.

I can't help but plan for my future as a solo person. I've had so many people fail me in life that I just don't trust anyone will be there long term.

The one thing I don't understand is how DA's are supposedly more narcissistic. What does this even mean? In some aspects of myself I think I kind of suck at life but in other aspects I like who I am. I used to have horrible self esteem thanks to my parents but I've come a long way since then. I feel kind of neutral towards myself most days.

I think it's not so much that I avoid emotional connections with others, it's that sometimes I don't feel it much at all.  That being said I still do my best to be supportive of people in my life and as far as I'm aware, people are happy to have me as their friend. I'm trying to be objective as possible when saying this.

I don't really relate to the ""keep emotions to yourself"" claim about DA's. If anything, I'm an open book. I think I just never cared if information can be used against me.

In conclusion, I think I've established healthy boundaries for myself and a good circle of people to be around. But I still have many DA tendencies. Is it weird that I've come to accept this and make it work?

I know I'm DA but I think I'm trying to figure out how much and to what extent.",zm0e7f,27,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/zm0e7f/dismissive_but_also_secure_is_that_a_thing_dasa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
522,Rant: I’m {da} only following therapist that acknowledge two sides of the story,"This is a rant and I just have to get my thoughts somewhere. 

Ever since realizing I’m an avoidant, it really cleared up how I understood my experiences. 

That being said I also feel like therapy / mental health influencer for the most part take the point of view that if one partner doesn’t respond to “your needs” then they’re automatically toxic, abusive, whatever whatever.  

And at the risk of sounding defensive, I feel like expecting me to react right away, in the RIGHT way, in the moment to the anxious feelings of my partner is not healthy for ME. 

For example: my partner (of 3.5 yrs) has Anxiously attachment style. I only just started seeing our dynamic through this lens and it all makes sense. There are moments where I’m expressing very loudly that I’m happy about something and that has triggered them. (I don’t know why but it does). And then THEIR big emotion triggers MINE, and I don’t know HOW to console them while also feeling like I’m being healthy for myself because I’m just not there yet. I’ll just sit there with them and calm myself down. Mind you not leaving them but I can’t like just go in for a hug. I personally have issues with physical signs of affection. 

But any influencing therapy person would probably look at this and say “oh if you’re clearly in distress and your partner doesn’t do this or that, they’re toxic /ignoring you blah blah”

where’s the conversation about Avoidant having to hold they’re own boundaries when anxious attachment types are having they’re moments ? This sounds bad and I’m not saying that my partner and I don’t have a work around, but I’m thinking about avoidants who probably do want to learn online about how to navigate this without instantly being demonized.

There are maybe just two accounts that I’ve seen that actually feel fair about these scenarios. And they absolutely use attachment theory. 

Idk, anyone else feel something similar?

527,I’m not able to express my anger and instead become passive-aggressive {da},"I know I’m doing it, but I still can’t get it right. At this point, after nearly 2 years of therapy and countless arguments caused by this, I just feel immensely stupid and useless. It will usually be a tiny thing – like a tone of voice she uses or that she tells me to put the cup back in the cupboard. The worst is when I feel criticized in any way. It scratches an itch and I get tense, I can literally feel myself pulling inwards, closing up and withdrawing.  

I won’t say a thing, though. Even if she asks what’s wrong, I usually say ‘nothing’ or ‘I don’t know’ - while still being inaccessible and distant. In my mind I just feel so stupid and petty, I can’t bring myself to say what the thing is – I don’t believe myself and try to convince myself that it’s not that big of a deal, that it shouldn’t bother me, that I’m stupid for being offended by this… After a while I don’t even know what the truth is. I feel so entangled, overwhelmed and lost.

End then it lasts a while until she’s too frustrated with my behavior and starts telling me off, justifiably. This now feels like taking a beating – I feel like a little baby,  embarrassed, disappointment and hopeless. I know I’m wrong. I know I should be sharing my emotions openly, which I’m trying to do with little success. We then have another conversation on how I can’t keep doing this and she won’t stand this much longer, I agree, the thing blows over. Until a week or two later, when the same situation occurs.

I’m stuck in a vicious loop. It makes me hate myself. I feel humiliated that I can't change this behavior. I feel even worse going through the cycle, having to sit there embarrassed and collect yet another piece of evidence that I'm an idiot. And it's even more pitiful to ask for empathy and act like a victim, when you're the one causing the problem. I didn't ask to be this way.

528,Finally found an explanation of mindfulness that made it make sense to me {fa},"*Relevant to avoidants because I think we often use dissociation as a coping mechanism*

Mindfulness promotes the integration of right and left brain functioning - helping the client to feel and think simultaneously and egosyntonically.

Work then primarily involves staying present to the kinesthetic sensations of fear and noticing the psyche's penchant to dissociate or distract from them. Dissociation can be either the classical right brain distraction of spacing out into reverie, fantasy, TV/computer trance, fogginess or sleep - or it can be the left brain, cognitive dissociation of becoming distracted in obsessive thinking. Particularly nefarious here is the inner critic's penchant for dissociating from and reacting to depression and fear with toxic cognitions and reveries of endangerment and perfectionism. 

Over and over, the client needs to be guided to rescue themselves from dissociation (left and/or right), and to gently bring their awareness back into fully feeling and experiencing the sensations of their fear and noticing their reactions to it. 

I can't speak for others, but I have noticed that in searching for the answer to emotional struggles, the answer always seems to come back to ""mindfulness""

It has been a very confusing concept for me.

This explanation from Pete Walker is the first time I have felt I understood the purpose of mindfulness and therefore felt able to participate.

529,I was humbled by someone's vulnerability and integrity today {FA},"I was due to meet with a school friend today who I haven't seen or spoken to for 40+ years when we were 20ish, except for rare FB contact, after he said he'd be staying an hour's drive from my area on a short trip he'd arranged with guy friends. He video-called a couple of days ago but we didn't fix plans. There was silence from him until today, the morning of the meet, when he messaged to cancel because he realised on talking to me that he'd been in love with me all these years.

His message was full of beautiful honesty, regret, apology, sadness and care, that touched me deeply.

When he hadn't confirmed plans by last night the old pre-AT me would have been convinced he's arranged something better or that I'd done something wrong or looked hideous on vid.

530,Dating is hard | {SA} {DA},"Tired and I have a big day tomorrow, so keeping it brief. 

Well, I went on a date, was very excited, scheduled a second date, and as soon as I text to check in the day of, “he thought he might have Covid”.  I can spot a flake when I see one. I decided not to push any further. Sure enough, a couple weeks go by. Out of curiosity, I notice his bio on the app has been updated to specify he’s only looking for FWBs. Our date happened with me being clear I want something serious. He said he wasn’t against that. I can infer he learned quickly that he in fact was against that upon reflection. Well, at least that means it wasn’t *something intolerable about me* that scared him off. 

But also, *it wasn’t me that scared him off*. Which means that deep down my latent “only able to want men who aren’t choosing me” alarms are now going off and I’m having to tell myself that *no*, we aren’t going to put ourselves into fwb scenarios to try and win his interest over, thanks. We’re more important than that. We wanna hold out for someone who actually wants to be with us, thank youuuuu. 

It doesn’t help that he is basically exactly 100% my type, looks wise. Can’t we get a dude that looks like that and make him available please? No? The only available men are the ones that aren’t attractive to me, and all the hot ones know they’re hot and therefore refuse to settle down?

Goddddddddd damn it. And from what I can tell, dating is just *like this*. For everybody. Why didn’t y’all tell me?! I really had myself believing that I could get someone real quick if I just fixed myself.

I think the moral here is that I thought for so long that all it would take to fix my relationship problems was to become emotionally available myself, able to be attracted to new people. I’d find someone cute and ready for me really quickly, right? Actually, wrong. Turns out a brief dive into the experience of everyone who’s trying to seriously date is that it’s basically entirely emotionally unavailable people on the apps. Once again, I have to deal with hopelessness. You serious??? And IM somehow the jackass for fighting the urge to take love where I can get it with other avoidants? The “healthy” thing to do is for me to hold out on love like a camel until some idiot decides I’m worth committing to? Idk dude, my camel humps is getting empty. I’m convinced available, hot dudes don’t exist. Or that I’m somehow going about dating wrong. 

Like my friend said, “it’s a buyers market and you just happen to be selling”. Someone close on this damn house already or I’m going to literally die of loneliness. 

Anyway, I actually kind of envy people who give into their insecure relationship patterning/are unaware about it. At least they get some scraps of love while I’m supposed to just sit here “being healthy” until the fabled person who’s ready for something serious comes along. Working toward security and self awareness is not the cure-all it can be made out to be. 🙄",vewsva,26,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vewsva/dating_is_hard_sa_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
531,Disassociation from memories and past traumas? {fa},"I don’t even know if this post will be approved or not but i feel like i should give a context/ trigger warning bc i mention some heavy stuff that i went through 

This is something that i realize every once in a while and that’s how I don’t feel connected to my memories or my life at all, I can’t put my experiences or how i was brought up into words, I don’t know how to describe it, was it a good childhood? Was it a bad one? I have no clue

When I started learning about attachment style and realized that I relate to FAs i was so confused as to why I would be an FA when i had a “normal” childhood and i had no trauma that could cause it

Then i started looking back and remembering the awful fighting in my home, how my dad would hit my mom, how one of them was technically cheating and was getting blackmailed for it and how me and my brother knew about it while the other parent was clueless so the cheating one tried to commit suicide, i also remember how i was assaulted when i was 7 or something around that age

The weirdest thing is that when I remember most of these things, i feel nothing towards them, like nothing at all! I forget about them until i be talking and sharing stuff with one of my friends and i blurt some heavy stuff out and I’m like, uh that’s weird ,i should be traumatized by this, why am i not traumatized? Why do i feel nothing towards this awful memory?",vd7rk2,26,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vd7rk2/disassociation_from_memories_and_past_traumas_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0

534,Different avoidant patterns? {fa},"(Sorry if this post is a mess, I’m just writing down what I’m thinking) 

When browsing AT subs or articles the avoidance pattern is often described as deactivating when things get more serious and intimate, but for me it works quite differently.

My avoidance is the strongest in the beginning - someone shows interest in me? Really scary, uncomfortable, stressful. No, thank you.

This pattern has led to only having one romantic situationship with a fellow avoidant two years ago. He, in maybe typical avoidant manner, took off once things got more intimate but was really invested and vulnerable-ish in the first few months.

Falling in love with him was the turning point for me switching from DA (feeling very meh at first, then enjoying spending time with him but being 100% that I don’t want anything romantic/serious) to FA (hot and cold, feeling very vulnerable but at the same time struggling with showing it) towards him, if not anxious leaning. 

What is it like for you, are you really invested and interested at first, when it’s still light and simple and then it switches or is your avoidance the strongest in the beginning?

One of my biggest struggles is wanting to get to know people in theory but feeling so uncomfortable with the process in practice.",uvhqhz,26,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/uvhqhz/different_avoidant_patterns_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0

536,He Left Me | {SA} {DA},"[Reddit is giving me trouble with posting, I’m going to try and edit the body text after it goes through. Just a moment please!]

[Edit 2: ok I’m just gonna try and bust it into two segments and continue in the comments].

One of my earliest memories is looking up at my mother when I was three years old and asking her where my father is. She explained that he had moved to a nearby city and wasn’t living with us anymore. 

I don’t remember feeling like my parents’ divorce was my fault. I don’t remember feeling much of anything before a certain age. Surely I did, but the early memories don’t have emotion tied to them that I can feel in the way I can feel other memories. I was never angry with my father for anything other than brief incidental annoyances as a teen, or little fits I would pitch as a kid, but never any deep resentment or rage toward him. Though I only saw him every other weekend (with of course some extended visits during the summer or other school breaks), he was attentive and met my needs as best he could as I was a kid. He would buy me things I needed nearly every time I’d visit, he would talk to me in a deep and connected way instead of letting his eyes glaze over any time I spoke about myself like my mother would. Dad would take me to museums and movies and art festivals. We would laugh and have inside jokes and enjoy ourselves. Even as I was a strange teen, even as I became withdrawn and depressed and obviously psychologically bruised, I was accepted by him. I never felt unsafe. Even with him being stoic and a little reserved emotionally, he did everything right enough, often enough, that I love and respect him as an adult. 

Still, he left me. 

My relationship to my mother is difficult. It might illuminate things for me to say that at nearly 30 years old, I’m paranoid to go into detail at length about her treatment of me online because I’m afraid she’ll somehow have tracked down my social media here and will find this (as she’s done with other social media of mine, ones where I went out of my way to quietly block accounts of hers I know she has, so she definitely saw that block and chose to circumnavigate it by logging out or some other way anyway). This post isn’t about her, and I don’t want to unroll a parchment paper with every greatest-miss she subjected me to, but some explanation may help. I didn’t exist much of the time unless it was to be criticized, blamed, or used as a source of attention for her. My needs were not only inconsistently attended to, they were very regularly denigrated or shamed. I was always wrong. I was always at fault, even as a tiny child. She never was wrong. She was never at fault. 

If I did anything that she felt reflected poorly on her, I was molded and shaped and chiseled away at like a marble block until I was forced to abandon myself to the image she wanted me to give. As a tiny child, my father would receive me for the weekend only to find that I’d been sent with dirty clothing. From middle school on, I didn’t have consistent school lunches. We had the income for it- but it was somehow my responsibility to remind her I needed money to be able to be fed. When I’d ask, she’d act annoyed. I learned to quit asking. She never looked up and thought, “Wow, I haven’t written a check for my child’s school lunches in a while— maybe I should make sure she’s getting fed!” Everything I liked was stupid. Or worse, morally repugnant. Unless it was something she also liked. Then it was great. If I didn’t want to entertain her cartoonishly absurd fantasy ideas, then I was being stupid or dumb. She always undermined my relationship to my father. If I cried in pain when she raged at me, she would growl at me like a furious bulldog, commanding me to stop. I was such a shambling mess in middle school that a concerned teacher once called my home to ask her if she was abusing me. (Fucking dumbass. What abuser is going to admit they are abusing their child?). Of course, she blamed and punished and shamed me for that too. 

My father left me. With her. 

I think if I had only experienced neglect, I may not have ever noticed that anything was “wrong”. But, with a volatile, immature, antagonistic caregiver, I had access to rage and resentment toward her from an early age. And I would tell myself that I wasn’t affected by my parent’s divorce itself, just my mother’s behavior. I loved my father, we had a relationship, so how could I have any negative emotions surrounding that? Funny. I’m nearly 30, and it was only two days ago that I realized I in fact had been hiding deep grief all along.",uqcygo,26,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/uqcygo/he_left_me_sa_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
537,{FA} Post break up questions,"In early March I was dumped. For months prior I was depressed,  overwhelmed and very shut down. At the time I knew nothing about attachment styles. My ex told me after the break up about attachment styles and I've been doing a deep dive into it all. It feels really good to know I'm not crazy, not the only one with these issues.

But, here's the issue. Since the break up we have gotten much closer and I have not struggled as much to be open or to try to be intimate. Is this normal? Is the fact that I don't fear rejection because I've already been rejected the reason we can be so close now? Has any one else experienced this?

538,Realizing just how avoidant I am. I'm very sad about this. I don't know how to be a social creature. How can I be human without people? I can't. Not successfully. What am I to do? {FA},"I am terrified of people. Constantly second guessing myself when interacting, avoiding my neighbors, avoiding people I know don't think poorly of me! I think this is a reflection of how poorly I think of me? And I am constantly projecting my own feelings on others and then use this as justification to avoid them. 
I feel like I fumble in conversations, I feel like I struggle to find the right words, the right response, do I say something funny now? Just so much conversational anxiety. 

My childhood interactions were performative so now I feel that I dont know how to naturally be with people. The woman that raised me was a narcissist and I was forced to perform for any and all that would see. I don't know how to be authentic. My chances were dashed so early. So now I feel crippled when I relate to people. The irony is that people find me VERY personable and warm. And while that may be true, I always feel so fucking fake and forced. I am terribly sad and have always been, I feel so very shameful and inadequate. 

I have somehow managed to isolate myself from the friends that I did have. Broke up with my boyfriend a few weeks ago. I want to be friends but that will take some time. So now I am terribly lonely with no meaningful friendships or community to lean on. I feel picky about my friends and while that may not be a bad thing on the surface, I use it as a way to dismiss people I think. The splitting is very intense for me. I do have BPD, as an aside. But ill tell myself like oh, she feels this way and I dont so we are deeply incompatible. And then I avoid.
I am very very good at isolating and convincing myself that thats NOT whats happening. The mind is full of deceptions, let me tell you. It is a tricky beast.

539,{da} {fa} losing hope,"I’m really starting to think relationships aren’t for me. and it sucks that i wish they were. many times my partner has told me they needed a loving response or reassurance from me, and that i don’t give it. that in itself causes me to deactivate.

541,Beyond {da}: a progress report,"Hello avoidants!

I'm about four years into my (fairly successful) project to move out of dismissive avoidance. I wanted to give you an update on how it feels to pull back the layers of the onion. [You can read my first progress report here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dismissiveavoidants/comments/oxr0gg/moving_out_of_dismissive_avoidance_progress/)

**Tl;dr** My main takeaway from the last six months is that my avoidance is often not an action, but a *reaction*. A reaction to daily triggers that I don’t really consciously register, and that I now have to rediscover. But man, they are buried deep. Anyhow, more details below.

**A bit of background**: My parents were divorced, absent and emotionally neglectful, as a child I survived by developing a dismissive-avoidant attachment style. About four years ago (I’m 40 now), I had a burn-out, and that started my therapeutic journey. I have a long term (15 years) relationship with a secure partner who gives me a lot of space. We also have an open relationship. 

**Getting in touch with my anxious side**

My partner asked me to go into relationship therapy with him, because he missed “the passion” in the relationship. At around the same time, he started dating a very passionate lover. For my avoidant self, this would have been no big deal. But now? Whooo boy!

I started having very strong Fear of Abandonment anxiety attacks that would catapult me right back into my childhood self, the divorce baby. The horror! With a lot of work and help from my supportive partner, I managed to get the attacks down in intensity in duration, until they became bearable, and eventually they subsided. 

Relationship therapy turned out to be a great idea. We specifically searched for a trauma-informed therapist and she has been amazing. I always thought my avoidance was just who I am, but she helped me see that my avoidance is also a *reaction* to tiny social things I didn’t even know were happening*.* 

Like, when I walk into the room and my partner is playing a videogame and doesn’t acknowledge me, I actually feel as ignored and unimportant as I did when I was a kid. So I react by withdrawing, maybe by putting on headphones and listening to a podcast. Then my partner feels shut out, and that cycle continues and eats our intimacy. 

Similarly, I found out that I feel immense rejection when I reach out to someone and it doesn’t go well. I thought I was just shrugging these things off!! I can’t tell you how immense my surprise is that I was actually having a very hard time with these things.

Now that I had all of these triggers and needs, they motivated me to ask for validation from my partner. He did the best he could, but it was just too much. After two days, he sat me down and said *“I’m happy to validate you, and I’ll do it as much as I can, but I can’t do it all for you”*. It’s just too much. I flipped out, of course! For two days, I stomped around trying to be as avoidant as I could: *“ Fine, I’ll do it all myself then. That’s what it always comes down to anyway, right? No one is going to take care of you but you”*. 

But avoidance wasn’t really working as well as it used to anymore :/

**Resource**: [Getting the love you want](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46188.Getting_the_Love_You_Want_). Our therapist adores this book, and I can see why. It’s all about how people find partner that will allow them to replay their childhood family drama’s. But it also offers a way out of that dynamic.

**Finding healthy coping mechanisms**

I had been working hard on getting my full range of feelings back, but without avoidance, I had no way to cope with those often painful feelings. It was rough! I started developing some psychosomatic stomach problems, and being really hard on myself. Coping mechanisms aren’t bad, per se, we all need them. But it was clear that I needed to find healthier coping mechanisms than avoidance.

\- **Spirituality**

I’m a pretty cynical person, so I was surprised to find that Buddhist spirituality was very helpful to me. I think it’s because as a child, I needed to be self-reliant, capable and supportive - good skills for self-confidence, but you have to keep those balls in the air to deserve love (you know, like [Luisa in Encanto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQwVKr8rCYw)). But in Buddhism, you deserve love and kindness just for being a human being. Somehow, I find it a very soothing way to work on self-esteem.

**Resources**: Any buddhism resources that focus on loving kindness (metta), any book by Jack Kornfield, Ram Dass, etc.

\- **Being in your body**

My stomach problems were clearly psychosomatic - dropping a fork would send my stomach in a spasm already. To deal with them, I went to see a bodyworker. She felt that I was still suppressing feelings, especially anger, and redirecting them to my body. It wasn’t all bad, the stomach problems also gave me a lot of body awareness that I was able to use to become more in tune with my body. 

I learned that I drag my body around through life like a mother drags an unruly child through a supermarket without really listening to it, and it’s time for that relationship to change. I also found out I have much stronger physical boundaries and much more personal space than I thought. 

It's been really nice to do bodywork and also get a lot more sensitivity back. I feel, see, hear and taste more and it's been honestly amazing. 100% worth it.

**Resources**: If you’re dealing with this thematic, see a bodyworker! I had good luck with searching for someone specializing in “somatic experiencing”

**- Developing anger**

It was clear anger was getting to be a real problem, and I worked hard with the psychologist to bring it to the surface more. I think working on my self-esteem was the most important thing to bring forth anger. This work wasn’t really fun, I find anger scary and threatening and I really dislike myself when I turn into a screaming rage person like my stepmom is. But it also helps you stand up for yourself, and helps protect you. I’m still very much trying to get the hang of it, but I’m happy to at least have the capacity for anger now.

**Book**: [Instant Anger Management](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56684917-instant-anger-management)

\*\*\*

That's all my progress so far. I'm not going to lie, there's been times where I wished I'd never gotten started on this whole journey. The lows have been very low. But the highs have also been high. I experienced a lot of really good feelings and well-being when exploring my new coping mechanisms - even the anger! Being in my body more brings me tons of joy and really changes my perspective on a lot of things. 

Hope you all are doing well! <3",tfgn3r,26,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tfgn3r/beyond_da_a_progress_report/,AvoidantAttachment,0
542,Flattened personality—just trying not to shut down {FA},"I've been trying again with my ex, who I've allowed myself to feel deep, intense love feelings for—a first for me in many years. I can't believe I ever talked myself out of him honestly, we're just such an insanely good match. But that's exactly *why* I talked myself out of him before. He scared the shit out of me. This is a big one. I want to do the whole life thing with him.

But we keep falling into a kind of tension. Not fighting, not conflict, just tension—a lack of relaxedness. I feel like I am completely blank and just have absolutely nothing to say, let alone anything interesting.

In our previous relationship this was not the case, nor is it with me in general when I'm comfortable with people. I have a lot of avid interests and can talk and talk and talk about them. He and I used to have incredibly invigorating, stimulating conversations for hours on end, several times week, without ever missing a beat—we actually actively marveled about how we *never* ran out of things to talk about! 

I'm trying to make sure I listen to podcasts, read books, talk to people—just to make sure I have things to say when we hang out. He's also not all that responsive to a lot of things I talk about these days so that doesn't help.

I feel like my personality is flattened by periodic anxiety, and his tentativeness about the relationship is making me want to shut down and pull away before I get hurt. The times when I'm able to be most exuberant is when we're around other people (to break the tension?), when I'm on some kind of substance that helps with inhibitions, and when I've gotten on a good roll feeling like I am completely deserving of this relationship. But I keep sliding off the edge. 

I don't know what I'm looking for. Has anyone experienced this? Like your mind just being completely blank around someone? No thoughts, sometimes. None at all. Is this dissociative? I feel like I'm kind of pretending to not be shut down but just am, or something.",sy9vue,27,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/sy9vue/flattened_personalityjust_trying_not_to_shut_down/,AvoidantAttachment,0

I think I also do it because I miss my alone time.

545,My inner child is mad at my adult self,"Yesterday I restarted EMDR therapy. I've been in a weird place lately with a lot of long buried things coming up. I was recently triggered by a movie while at my boyfriend's house. I have been in 2 relationships where I was physically abused and looking back almost every man in my life has put his hands on me somehow. 

When my therapist and I do EMDR, we pick a 'bad' phrase to reprogram into a 'good phrase.' We were going to start with ""I don't deserve to exist"" but I felt like recently I am being triggered by the physical abuse memories/flashbacks and asked to start with ""I am not safe."" We had a back and forth and actually landed on ""I am powerless"" which caused an immediate emotional reaction in me. 

We started and I had the most intense emotional reaction I've ever had. I could not physically breathe. I was frozen in fear and anxiety, although sitting safely in my therapist's office. He even stopped the movement short because he was afraid I was going to pass out. 

During EMDR sessions, what happens to me is an inner dialogue where I talk to myself. I went from ""I'm powerless"" to ""men are not safe"" to ""I'm scared"" to ""I just want to die."" Every now and then he needs to redirect my brain, and he asked when the earliest I felt like I wanted to die was. 10? At least 10. Probably earlier. 

And suddenly there I am. Me as a child staring me in the face and yelling at me. ""You don't see me."" ""You shoved me away and pretended I didn't exist just like everyone else."" ""You're supposed to be better."" ""You're supposed to be who I needed."" ""You're failing."" 

It's a really strange thing to see and hear you yelling at yourself. I felt like I was both my inner child and me. I felt the anger from my inner child. I felt the defeat from my adult self, the hopelessness. So much shame and guilt. And the worst part is that it makes me want to run from everyone. It makes me want to hole up. 

I am broken, and I don't feel like anyone should have to put up with me. 

I know the only way out of my anxiety and avoidance is through. I have to go through the buried stuff. I have to go through the pain of facing my past, my emotions. I feel like it's going to get worse before it gets better, and that's really hard to deal with. And I hate that starting to heal has somehow made me feel even more avoidant and alone.",s9kav5,26,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s9kav5/my_inner_child_is_mad_at_my_adult_self/,AvoidantAttachment,0
546,Struggling with my own past cruelty,"I'm really struggling today.

I looked back on my journals from my last relationship, actually looking for any little snippets I could send to him (we're trying to reconcile) to show how I was feeling—which is that I really did love him and want life with him.

I found a few snippets in there saying this... written in my more rare tender/honest moments. But they were buried under mountains of really cruel, petty, slanderous, meanness toward him and about us. I wrote for pages and pages talking myself out of this relationship, nit-picking, finding anything I could to ""prove"" that it wasn't right for me.

It wasn't just those mean moments either, I feel like everything my eyes landed on —from thoughts on career and spirituality and creative projects and friendship and family— just perfectly outlined this emptiness that now I feel completely faced with. Things that I used to find meaning in and can't anymore. Finding everything wrong in every connection I have—with my mother, my friends, people in my past.

We've been talking through some of the more painful parts of our past the last few days, too. Some of them are really hard to talk about. Like when I didn't kiss (or touch/have sex with) him for five months. Or some of the ways I would ""tease"" him that crossed the line from playful loving teasing, into actual cutting criticisms.

Life is so short, and the extent to which I have sabotaged, hurt people, and haven't been able to let love in is so crushing that I can't withstand it. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to keep getting through the days. How am I supposed to forgive myself? It feels impossible.

547,"discovered i'm FA, should I apologize to my ex?","after recently discovering that I have a fearful-avoidant attachment I started to notice how it has affected my past relationships. one in particular was so great and things started to get pretty serious and I knew that I loved him, yet felt like I was looking for any reason to get out (deactivating). and instead of talking to him about it as I should've, I just broke things off. I know that it hurt him and seemed pretty out of the blue and it was because he was such a great partner. I also broke it off with the whole ""it's not you it's me"" but I was dead serious because while I didn't realize it at the time, I definitely had some things to work through. it does hurt knowing he probably thinks that was a cliche lie, when it was true. I also ended up literally avoiding him after because it hurt knowing that I still wanted to be with him even though I broke things off because I was too afraid of my own feelings.

it's been a few years now and I want to apologize for my behavior. I don't want him to think it was because he wasn't good enough. as bad as my reasoning to break up was, he did try to reach out several times within the 2 years post-breakup but I was still very avoidant. it's 4 years later now, should I apologize or just let it go? I always felt like apologies are never really a bad idea but a lot of people seem to side on no apology from reddit threads (though the break up situations seem much more drastic than mine, which I'm not sure how that changes things). any insight would be much appreciated :)

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your responses! It truly means so much to me. I ended up apologizing and he responded very positively :) and that he was happy to receive the message even after all this time. It makes me happy to finally let him know what I'd always been so afraid to express. We're still chatting about it and neither of us have any ill will towards each other. To anyone else in a similar situation, I'd say apologize if you can do so sincerely and accept that there may be a negative, positive, or even no response.",qo55cu,26,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/qo55cu/discovered_im_fa_should_i_apologize_to_my_ex/,AvoidantAttachment,0
548,"DA: Emotional avoidance, or autistic overwhelm?","Hi, newbie here (though not to Reddit). I found this sub after diving into attachment theory while trying to understand a close friend, who I think is FA. Along the way, I discovered I’m likely DA myself — even after taking a quiz that put me as secure! I’ve tried to read a lot of the threads here, as well as many articles and videos, but I’m still at a bit of a loss. So if you’ll pardon my flailing, I’d love some feedback. (Apologies for the verbosity.)

An important fact here is that I’m autistic, highly sensitive (sensorily & otherwise), and introverted, and am frequently overwhelmed by this modern world — including romantic relationships. This overwhelm frequently leads to shutdowns and burnouts. Even if overwhelm/burnout is not happening, I tend to miss social cues and other hints of typical relationship language — both verbal and non-verbal. I sometimes wonder if there’s a sort of ‘color’ of committed romantic relationships that I simply can’t see, and hence don’t desire? I’ve had partners hint that I was missing something they could see clearly, but was out of reach for me — so much so that they couldn’t even describe it to me. It’s always been very confusing to me, to be honest.

Although a lot of what I’ve read about DA traits match up with me, there’s also parts that don’t, namely: being disconnected from emotions and intimacy, being closed down, secretive, highly conflict-averse, and quick to leave an anxious or secure type who’s looking for a deeper/closer relationship.

While I’ve always been independent, I don’t think it was because I couldn’t deal with the emotions or closeness or vulnerability or intimacy. I’ve had a few relatively long-term relationships, including one (brief, no kids) marriage. I’m not a fan of conflict, but I’ve been able to work through conflicts with partners — and also to know when a conflict is simply too deep and unresolvable to continue. To my knowledge, I’ve not felt unlovable or distrustful or afraid of rejection or abandonment.

Rather, I simply get totally overwhelmed with the typical demands of a relationship (whether romantic or friendship): to spend more time together, to talk or text frequently, to make major life plans together, to rise up in the relationship escalator. If all that goes too much or too far or too fast or too complicated, I get super-stressed, exhausted, overwhelmed, and shut down.

I’ve always needed *lots* of time completely on my own to recharge quietly (if not completely silently) and process things, and unfortunately most people I’ve dated couldn’t understand why I needed that, or even thought it unhealthy or impossible.

Long-distance relationships work better for me, as I am mostly guaranteed a significant chill-out time before the next time we meet. But honestly, I’ve found that the best for me is a mixture of ‘alternative’ relationships: deep, platonic friends of varied ages and gender and locality, plus non-monogamous, sexual play partners. These are *not* usually casual or short-lived: some of these alternative relationships have continued for decades.

I’m wondering if any folks here might feel similarly, or come to any personal truth about it, or know of books or other resources in which to explore this dilemma. Is this sort of relationship-overwhelm a part of the DA trait, or should I be looking elsewhere?",15t9wau,26,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15t9wau/da_emotional_avoidance_or_autistic_overwhelm/,AvoidantAttachment,0
549,Random rant: I think better understanding patriarchy has helped me worked on my avoidant tendencies {FA},"33M and currently single. As a man, I've always been passionate about equity and equality. Feminism seems to fall into that spectrum. I know this is a WAYYY out there topic but I can try to tie it back. I grew up with my grandma, who pushed a lot of patriarchal type of upbringing onto me. Cold, emotionless, and unforgiving. My value was only measured by how well I did in school. This lead me to kind of treat relationships the same way later on.

Although therapy has helped tremendously, I still found myself repeating the same avoidant patterns I've always had: picking apart flaws, holding onto resentment instead of communicating, deactivating, etc. I recently started reading about intersectional feminism, patriarchy and how men are hurt by patriarchy. It opened my eyes in a lot of ways and kind of filled in the gaps to where my therapy fell short.

Working on my attachment issues has started become less about ""self improvement"" or ""working on my flaws"", but more about creating emotional and intellectual safety for my partner. To enable them to feel secure, that they can be with someone who will give back and do the work. I think that shift was an eye opener for me: that it's not about me and what I need to work on, but more about my future partner and how I can contribute to a healthy relationship.",152e9kx,26,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/152e9kx/random_rant_i_think_better_understanding/,AvoidantAttachment,0
550,I want closeness but then push people away when they offer it {FA},"I (27F) have noticed that when someone isn’t meeting my needs or I’m wanting more connection, I really crave closeness. I crave more contact from people, more reassurance, for them to step up and be there for me. I experience quite intense anxiety and sadness. 

However, I’ve noticed that sometimes if they then actually do this it makes me withdraw. Some of the thoughts that run through my mind are:

- Leave me alone
- I don’t need you
- I can cope by myself
- There’s nothing you can do to help
- It’s too little too late
- Relying on others is weak/pathetic 
- I don’t trust you enough to confide in you
- If I do confide in you and you let me down I’m going to feel even worse
- You’re only offering support because you feel obligated to
- It’s not genuine
- I don’t want to inconvenience them
- I don’t want them to go out of their way for me

It’s like I want people to want to be there for me and to offer support but I don’t actually want to take them up on it.

I know these thoughts are very black and white and overgeneralisations and that the reality is probably more of a middle ground. But it still feels true. 

Idk I think I just have a massive lack of trust that they’ll consistently follow through. And then I’ll feel like a mug and even more let down. And that makes sense because growing up I felt consistently let down by my parents and have done so in romantic relationships too. 

But I do realise that continuing to do this now just reinforces my belief that I can’t rely on anyone. And it deters people from actually being there for me. I imagine the way of breaking this cycle is to take steps to accept it and confide in people a bit. But it’s hard.

551,Help did i deactivate and nitpick? Or do i have valid reasons not to continue dating this person? {fa},"So this year I(F27)dated this guy let’s call him Denzel  (M27) for around 3 months. When I went on the first date with him I didn’t feel the much. And to be fair I rarely ever feel much on the first date but he seemed like the biggest green flag when we discussed therapy and the mentioned that he had a lot of breakthroughs in therapy the last few years. We didn’t discuss attachment styles yet but from communicating with him he seemed very secure. He was always open to communicate, would very quickly discuss if something was bothering him and would want to talk things out. Other than that he was my type in terms of humor, he was very confident and was also very open to discussing feelings when I was having a bad day or if something came up during one of our dates. He once said something to me that brought me to tears, not in a bad way, but in a good way. 

I did start noticing some things that ended in me ending things a few months ago. Now this person has texted me to check in since when I ended things I also just was in a very stressful period of my life. I’m trying to understand if I ended things due to avoidance or if my reasons were justified. Here were the things I noticed/ my reasons: 

1. He would remind me every time he did something for me. Kind of like he was keeping score. And then also remind me how special I had to be that he was doing all these things for me. E.g he would cook for me and bring it up that I wasn’t cooking for him or that he went through a lot to cook for me 

2. He would remind me every time he spent money on me or for me. He would complain if he was paying for more dates even though he made 3x what I made and had a huge trust fund (800k-1m) + had two houses where he made rent. Mind you he would suggest the dates and always want to go to high end places. He went as far as saying that he couldn’t buy me flowers cause they were expensive. I don’t mind paying for stuff but I was expecting things to be equitable not 50/50 given our financial situations. I did bring this up and he said the only solution was for me to work harder or get a better job.

3. He would promise me things. Like say he would buy me flowers or chocolate. Without me asking and then turn around and say he can’t get them for me because they are too expensive. And then started saying he’s just not a romantic guy. 

4. He was pushy with PDA. And would feel offended that I didn’t want to make out with him in public. To the point that he tried telling me that I should let go of my insecurities and just make out with him like normal people do. He did let this go but was quite pouty about it . 

5. He bragged about the fact that he was the one who dumped his ex and told me that she was dumb as fuck. When I asked him to elaborate he couldn’t explain how she was dumb. It really came off as if he was the one who never gets left. And I didn’t understand why he was so proud. 

6. When I was ending things he protested and said “this never happens to me. Things always go the way I want them to”. He then tried to make me “stay” by telling me “it’s a shame. I was going to take you to my holiday house In Italy for a vacation and pay for your tennis lessons. Oh well, guess that’s not happening anymore” which made me get the ick even faster. 

So are these big enough issues? Or am I being nitpicky and avoiding intimacy?",ztqbp3,25,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ztqbp3/help_did_i_deactivate_and_nitpick_or_do_i_have/,AvoidantAttachment,0
552,Roots of tracking others' irrationality {FA},"I'm staying with my family this week after a really long time and a long time of attachment and therapy work, and the things I notice at every corner is astounding. Recently I experienced something that made me realize the core of my hypervigilance and tendency to track other people's potential irrationality and my distrust and unease about my behavior around them.

We were all sitting in the room together and I got up to get something from another room, and because my headphones are messed up my phone started playing music outloud right as I was leaving so I kind of turned it off and went out of the room.

For most people this probably a normal occurence that they would forget immediately after. What *I* thought was ""oh shit they're gonna think I arranged someone to call me and I'm leaving the room to be secretive and they'll probably think I'm talking to someone right now.""

Because the fact is, that is exactly what they would think. And they would not talk to me or confirm that with me either. They would completely decide on that all on their own, gossip about it to each other, start passive aggressively referencing that in conversation to me or making subtle remarks and throwing glances at each other, meanwhile I'd be trying to figure out what the fuck is going on this week. And then I'd ask them what's happening, they would ""confront"" me, I would explain the actual situation, and no one would believe me and they'd assume I'm lying and this is the continuation of that secretiveness.

So now I'm wired to immediately anticipate this convoluted batshit unraveling of events and pre-emptively arrange my behavior around it and if it's out of my control (like an accident with headphones) I get a rush of fucking *anxiety*.

553,Over limerence {FA},"I am just over a long few months of feeling limerence, how do you reconnect to yourself afterwards? I was totally on a triggered state, disrespecting the other need for space, fighting, fawning, then a big moment of  confusion and puff💨 I don’t feel anything anymore, it’s almost of all this months have been erased and this person have never been in my life (I deleted everything about them) it was also not something long for us to know each other well, be so close or vulnerable, he ran when we should have been vulnerable instead, which triggered me a lot, it was intense and I wanted to feel close and connected with them still, I felt like he represented a lot of my shadow.

I wanted to be seen by him and wanted to see him, but I am not healed, I have poor boundaries, I can be a little congruent with reassurance, I don’t know if I know how to accept it, I don’t know if I trust people to be genuine when they are reassuring or nice to me and I overly reassure others/give it (even if the person doesn’t even needs it) it comes of as fawning. I feel like I am to much at times, but it’s confusing because I also need a lot of space at same time, I need things to be slow too, 

How to you reconnect to yourself?

How to you not suppress the emotions? Without having to “erase” things, feeling numb? 

How to not shame yourself when your color glasses it’s out?  

I am very reactive and that cause great harm to myself!  It’s embarrassing, emotional, it’s automatic, doesn’t come from a place of care, but in need to soothe myself I need to react… 
And all I want is to disappear afterwards!

555,{da} {fa} How to you respond to being ghosted?,"I'm FA and was leaning secure prior to hooking up with a DA.  Since that I'm more anxious leaning.  
My DA has just ghosted me for the first time after 3 years.  
He has previously done some typical DA stuff like be distant, cold etc., but never ghosted me completely.    The trigger was two days away together followed by a probing question by me a few days later on whether he had been with a particular person at a particular time or not. I guess this was too invasive for him but to me, ghosting is not something I consider to caring behaviour. It came out of the blue- he told me to get lost and that was it.  Last time he came back he said he loved me- and would always love me.  Extremely confusing. 

I've encouraged him to learn about his attachment style etc. but he has not done anything about it to date, which makes me extra anxious.  
As an FA, I'm totally deactivated by this and I know I'm not strong enough to handle this kind of behaviour even if he comes back (which he has done many times after being distant).  

I'm interested to hear from other avoidants on how they have dealt with being ghosted suddenly and without explanation.

556,"I've just found out about avoidant attachment, and it explains almost everything {da}","Hello,

I (36F) have spent some time reading threads here and ta da! turns out a lifetime of angrily refusing to accept help is not 'normal'. I have ordered a book, should be with me today, but I would really appreciate any advice from anyone this resonates with (I'll try and be brief):

Since I was a teenager I remember having 'episodes' of knowing that no one actually enjoys my company. As an adult, I accept that that's probably not literally true, however, largely I am 'difficult' to get on with it and so I still believe it to be generally true. Even when I knew/know my behaviour was a bit 'mad', I did and do completely shut down and if possible physically remove myself from other people. The *relief* I feel when I have confirmation I'm not wanted is immense; it's not my worst fears realised, it's more like finally getting proof of a theory.

Lately I've gotten really, really upset, however, at how lonely I am. I thought I was fine. For the first time in my life I realise my mother will never hug me. I can't remember when she ever did - she must have, when I was a kid, but I also remember her flinching once when I kissed her goodnight. I guess she thought I was too old to be doing that. I should explain I had a normal, happy childhood and get on with all my family today.

Over the weekend my boyfriend is extremely annoyed at my pushing away, and he can't understand it. I tried last night to tell him what is going through my head, and tbh it's not a relief at all. He told me that I am an angry person, and I should go to a therapist. I guess - I suppose some stupid part of me thought he would tell me it actually is in my head and I'm not a waste of space. I wouldn't want to be friends with me so I don't know why I expect others to act differently. I do make his life obviously quite difficult in my dismissive rage/antipathy.

Anyway, saga over. My question is this: I need a coping mechanism. I am slowly and quietly resigning myself to the fact that almost any situation or anyone's life is better, or at least ambivalent, if I am not there. I can't really think of anywhere I'm wanted, truly. Other than emigrating, has anyone any advice for how to live with other people, but not impose yourself? This is just a request for practical information, as I cannot afford therapy, nor do I want it.

557,Becoming secure can be frustrating sometimes {FA},"I’m a FA that has been working my ass off to better communicate my needs in healthy ways with people in my life. I don’t want to be harsh but the more I learn and grow, the more that people in my life frustrate me. Some of the anxious people in my life are driving me nuts. I can’t say anything to some of my friends, and one very close friend in particular, without defense, excuses and things being turned back on me. It makes me incredibly avoidant internally. I just don’t even want to engage or hang out because there is zero accountability. On the other end, I have more avoidant people in my life who can’t discuss conflict or communicate for the life of them. I feel like I have to chase them down to get anything resolved. I refuse to do it and things that have upset or hurt me hang in the air when they inevitably come back and act like nothing has happened.

I don’t even mean to be on a high horse here. I’m an FA after all- I’ve done ALL of these things to people I love without even realizing it. I know that people are operating based on their programming, not to piss me off. The more I learn and grow though, the more the protest behaviors of others seems to wear me down. Can anyone else relate? Am I just swinging more avoidant right now and thinking I’m somehow better than other people or something? I’m just SO frustrated lately. It’s hard. I don’t plan to ghost anyone or cut them off. That would be unfair. These people aren’t toxic- that’s a distinction that I now trust myself to make and I would have no problem not being in a relationship with them, platonic or romantic, if they were. I do journal almost everyday and find myself confused and asking “wtf” a lot these days lol. It does help to get my feelings out that way so that I don’t lash out. So maybe I need to do some thinking and just spend less time with certain people and develop some better boundaries. I can only communicate what I feel and let the chips fall. I can’t and don’t want to control anyone but me. 

It’s weird and kind of alienating to realize how broken a lot of communication has become since I stoped being a people pleasure and trying to control every outcome. Sigh. Healing is a lot.

558,"Felt and behaved securely with DA who seemed perfect in almost every way. Now that he broke things off, I'm spiraling. {FA}","I'm never attracted to anyone, especially with online dating, but the guy I'd been seeing for the last two and a half months was the only one I've ever been impressed enough by to reach out to and actively pursue anything with. I thought he was great on paper, but he was even better in-person. He's the perfect partner in every conceivable way to me - life goals, values, personality, intelligence, looks, sense of humor, financial stability, skills in bed - there wasn't a single thing about him that didn't align with exactly what I wanted in a partner and then some. It's not even a major limerence thing, I know, because I kept catching myself quietly attempting to self-sabotage by looking for red flags and things wrong with him, only to continuously come up empty-handed.

Stupid as it sounds, it's literally like all my deepest desires were pulled from the recesses of my heart and given human form; and I've never felt anything even close to that in all my life until I met him.

I went into dating him feeling totally secure and that stayed consistent during my time with him. With him being DA, he was aloof and hot-and-cold at times with regard to texting but I never minded because he was always consistent with his responses and so I made sure to never overburden him with it. We always got on so amazingly well in-person that within the first month and a half he wanted me to meet his family and accompany him to the beginnings of a major life event/project he was about to undertake.

Like a cruel joke from the cosmos, he caught covid days before it was all supposed to happen and we never got around to rescheduling. Crueler yet, I found out early on that I'm not even close to his type, physically, and yet the attraction still was growing on both our ends as he'd never been so passionate and affectionate as that last night I spent with him, with us still talking about plans for the future the following morning and him sending an unusually cutesy text the next day.

The next week everything was normal until he started working on the major life event/project - something with a lot of moving parts that'll take months and undoubtedly a lot of physical and emotional labor to finish. Then I got radio silence for a few days, reached out asking if everything was okay, and he responded unusually promptly with surprising vulnerability, saying he was super busy and overwhelmed by the whole ordeal. I offered a helping hand or time and space for him to work through it - whichever of the two he needed.

After more radio silence, he ended things with me due to the overwhelming stress of it all, saying he hadn't planned for this major life event to happen prior to us dating (which was true) and that he didn't want to be unfair to me as he realized he needed to focus his attention on that, that he hoped I understood and that he didn't mean to waste my time.

I don't know if the reason he gave was true or not, but he'd been consistent up to that point, he seemed sincere, and the timing did align with what I knew he was going through, so I replied with a reassuring and secure response and left the door open in case he wants to try again once he's finished with the life event. I didn't get a response.

This was over a week ago, and the first few days I didn't feel much from him ending things, as it hadn't even been 3 months, so surely not enough time to get attached, I thought.

However, as time has gone on with NC, I've found myself spiraling from the abandonment and rejection wounds I thought I'd healed; going through all the AP patterns, wanting to reach out to ask inane, ruminating questions about why, if things had been going so well between us and this was the true reason, did he make the breakup a unilateral decision instead of a conversation; what I could have done differently to make him want to go the distance with me; if it was because I didn't fit his type physically, etc. Thankfully, these urges are tightly reined in by my avoidant side, but even that side now has me spiraling for a different reason:

Wanting an ego boost and to avoid and detach from the growing pain with the thought of a new romance (only in theory, I know I'm not in a place to actually engage) I figured if I was able to stumble upon as perfect a match as him in a sea of profiles with no filters, then if I upgraded to premium for a bit to filter out anyone who didn't meet my two basic nonnegotiables, then I was sure to find at least one guy with comparable qualities way faster, right?!

Within 10 minutes of swiping, I ran out of potential partners within a 100-mile radius and not a single one even so much as piqued my interest.

Now, instead of just suffering through the separation anxiety of a situationship breakup, I'm also now suffering through the fear of being defective and forever alone - too stubborn to ever settle knowing that a connection like this one could ever even exist in the first place.

I'm trying to recenter myself with PDS workbooks, but I can hardly concentrate on them between flip-flopping from feeling totally numb to inconsolable that even at the height of my secure attachment I still couldn't keep him interested enough to commit and that I'll probably never hear from him again, nor find anyone that checks even half the boxes he did, yet I can't even bring myself to cry about it.

561,Which attachment style is the one that can't date at all? {da}{fa},"So I heavily identify with dismissive avoidant tendencies with one major, glaring caveat:

I can't date or have sex.

Most DAs seem to be described as extremely capable of initiating romantic/sexual relationships that burn bright, hot and fast before fizzling out as the DA feels commitment approaching.

On the other hand I struggle to find partners/have sex/get into relationships at all, precisely *because of* my avoidant habits. For example:

*While I can appear approachable and attractive in a room full of strangers I think I'm never going to see again, the moment I detect someone trying to reach out to me I will enter flight-or-freeze mode, become awkward and probably torpedo the interaction.

If I somehow do manage to progress past the opening stages of dating, the commitment anxiety begins at the first date or even the pre-first date meetup, not after the honeymoon period. I've spent a lot of time in early interactions fighting the urge to literally, physically sprint away from my dates like a gazelle.

If I don't immediately flee the scene of date, don't count on making any real connection with me. Nothing is ever totally honest. If I can't present a heavily curated mask to my date on the fly, I will simply avoid engaging. And that habit is probably not going to fully go away, no matter how long the relationship is. I will definitely never argue with a partner if it's at all avoidable.

Sex is, and has always been, a type of work (not pleasure) where the avoidant proclivities to performance, perfectionism, competence and self-restraint are in full effect. The idea that I might have to be vulnerable and open with my partner while having sex is so anxiety inducing that I often avoid sex and can't even perform when I try.

It's a bit baffling how DA's are often described as, more or less, fuccbois for 3-6 months before thier avoidance kicks in. I would think that all thier avoidant habits would result in an inability to engage in this kind of mating in the first place, as in my situation.

Or maybe this means that I'm not DA, or maybe an extreme variant? Or maybe there is another attachment style that tracks more with my particular difficulties in the basics of dating.

562,{fa} where is the middle line and what does that action look like,"I’m dating a really lovely man and it’s my first attempt at ‘conscious’ dating.

We’re 2 months in but have known each other 12 years before. 

My feelings are growing quickly now and I both love and hate it.

It’s triggering some self destruct urges.

I’m afraid of him not liking me as much as I like him, or of him dumping me, or of me finding out he isn’t what I think he is, OR him realising I’m not as great as he thinks I am 🤦🏻‍♀️

My brain is whirring around it today and I’m flip flopping between dumping him so he can’t hurt me (avoidant tendencies) and protest texting him to try to get comfort (anxious tendencies). I haven’t acted on  either urges. And now I’m left with the realisation that I don’t know what the middle line is.

I suppose just to sit with the feelings and acknowledge it’s uncomfortable but I am safe. Maybe try to explain to him.

564,Changed my flag from {fa}{da} leaning to {sa},"In 2017 I left an 8 yr toxic relationship with a vulnerable narcissist who completely ruined me and pushed me further into DA. He verbally, emotionally, financially, physically and sexually abused me. Police was involved, arrests were made. My ex did a borderline suicide attempt and had the audacity to harass me that it was my fault, and ""if I am happy now"". My grandiose narcissistic father had health problems and was wheeled into ER on that same day my ex attempted suicide. I crashed and had the deepest worst burnout of my life. I couldn't even leave my house anymore. I lived in a depression home for a couple of months too afraid to go to the supermarket. 

In the middle of the ruins of my life a voice inside myself called out to me. ""Your life is not working for you, because you lack self-compassion"". I could hear my inner-child weeping and howling with sadness, and all I wanted to do was embrace that child. 

I embarked on a journey that took more than a couple years to recover from, because I had accute stress syndrome and C-PTSD and attachment issues. 

I gathered a shelf of new books: Brene Brown, Byron Katie, Eckhart Tolle, Viktor Frankl, Mark Manson, Bessel van der Kolk, Emily Nagoski, Esther Perrel, Gabor Maté, Louise Hay, Harriet Lerner, Amir Levine, Rachel Heller, Jeb Kennison, and the list goes on. 

I started binging videos about trauma-healing, secure attachment and narcissistic abuse like it was my obsession. I must have watched over 500+ hours of material. 

I went to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I joined the Personal Development School. I bought courses of verified relationship coaches. I started journaling. I kept a gratefulness and mood journal. I picked up sports and new hobbies. I strengthened the friendships I already had and made new ones. I repaired the relationships with my family together with them. 

I started dating again, and then figured I still had some work to be done. Kind of a lot of work, since it was the first time in 10 years I genuinely fell in love with someone, and my ex was still under my skin, and still stalking me. It brought to the surface what insecurity I still have in romantic relationships. 

Through my therapist I got back in touch with victim organizations, social workers and police. 

I finished my research master with independently gathered data and worked full-time and had an offer to continue with a PhD and publish my paper - all in this same period. 

I moved from my crummy student apartment to a three story house and a bath en suite with a garden in front and back. After being raised in such a poor environment that I still remember hunger and squalor in my youth. 

I just finished 12 EMDR sessions and a year of schematherapy that funnily worked like a charm. My confidence and self-love is blazing. 

I am transitioning for the first time in my life from power-struggle into the stability phase with an unaware DA who has done no work. Still, we co-habitate and have a generally mutually supportive and peaceful relationships even if there is still some insecurity between us. I have gathered the knowledge and self-awareness to react mostly secure. 

I have a work conflict because of a nasty colleagues mean and jealous interference with my performance. She is targeting me to become the black sheep, but that ain't happening. I told my boss what is going on, that I deserve a pay-raise, and that within now and 6 months time I will have a job that pays double. No f*** given (thanks Mark), I know how to value myself and how to appreciate my own work even if I am not flawless. 

I changed my flag to SA today because I feel that I have earned it. I like myself so much, it is almost dangerous. 

Reflecting back between 2017 and 2022 - I am super proud of myself. I made adversity my stepping stone to greater things. Keep grinding and keep believing my friends. Future you is going to thank you.

I also want to thank everyone on this road who has listened to me, supported me, touched me in a genuine way. Without you it wasn't possible.

566,"{fa} went on a first date, feeling uneasy.","I have a history of being attracted to men who are much more avoidant than me. 

I clearly equate having to work very hard for someone's affection with desire, I also seem to crave the safety of distance through not being treated very well.

Well I'm sick and tired of how demoralizing chasing feels, the toll it takes on your sense of self worth, giving without receiving.

I think I deserve after the previous few dumpster fire ""relationships"" I've had, to be actually treated nicely.

In comes yesterday's experience. Went for a coffee date yesterday with a man who was very cleary very interested in me. 

I could tell right off the bat that he is definitely not avoidant. 

My problem is that I can't tell if he is AP or if he just seems that way because I've dated severly avoidant men in the past.

Part of me also thinks that it might be nice to be chased for once instead of being the chaser.

He said things that felt a little too nice and too eager that are sort of spooking me, but I am really wanted to break out of my pattern and allow someone to treat me well.

I'm trying to battle the thoughts of ""he only likes me because he doesn't know me yet"" ""he's just desperate, I could be literally anyone""

Kindness and interest just feels so foreign to me. The fact that he paid for my coffee even made me uncomfortable.

Before firing off the comment, stop and think:

—Is OP asking for advice or support? (If you’re not sure which, ask before assuming or reacting.)

—Am I actually answering OP’s question?

—Am I answering, or am I seeking support from someone who posted seeking support?

—Am I taking a vent personally and offering unsolicited advice?

—Am I commenting from my own personal experience as an avoidant person who has exhibited  the behaviors or patterns the OP is asking about? Or am I commenting from the perspective of a non-avoidant and adding in assumptions?

—Am I currently upset with an avoidant person and taking out my frustrations on avoidant strangers on the internet? 

—Am I triggered by avoidants? If so, why am I following this subreddit?

—Am I creating a story about what someone other than the OP may be thinking or doing, and am I invalidating the OP by doing so? Especially if OP didn’t ask for this perspective?

—Am I interrogating OP instead of being supportive or answering their question, because they remind me of my partner or ex? Is this appropriate at this time?",rh9b4s,25,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rh9b4s/commenting/,AvoidantAttachment,0
571,I [DA] successfully guided a conflict with my friend [AP],"So this story starts here: [My best friends (AP) both went off on me](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/r4tuks/my_best_friends_ap_both_went_off_on_me/).

During the week following, I could feel myself bothered by the conversation. I started to feel bitter and come up with plans in my head about how I should become a dull friend so he'll lose interest in me. And after he loses interest in me, I'll make sure I don't ever become close with anyone again.

But then I quickly identified those thoughts as avoidant strategies. I have a friend who recently gave me conversational strategies to navigate conflict. I decided that in order to solve this issue, I have to face it head on and tell him how I felt.

So I sent a text first letting him know that I was a little bothered by the conversation and I'd like to get on the phone together if he was cool with it. He agreed and later I called him.

First, I asked him how his day was and told him a little bit about mine. I then told him that I love him very much and the purpose of the conversation comes from that and I'd appreciate it if he'd let me complete my thought first and then share his afterwards.

He agreed and I went into my explanation. I used my recently failed friendship with the female AP as an example (he knows about it) and pointed out that I noticed a lack of trust \[towards me\] from that scenario which seemed to have no grounds as I always showed up. I said it bothers me that he seemed to suddenly lose trust in me though I'd been showing up for him. I welcomed him to raised major red flags/sound off alarms when he really, really needed me to show up in a very specific way. Cause otherwise, I'd been present in conversations with him but he'd neither accept or reject my offers \[of assistance and company\]. I said its ok if he doesn't know what he needs from me in the moment but its difficult for me to know the trust is being challenged despite my consistent efforts.

...and then, a long silence.

He goes ""...ok"", eventually. His voice was weak and shaky. Not good news. I could tell he wasn't feeling this. I get a little nervous that this is going to deteriorate just like with the female AP.

So I ask him if he could share his thoughts.

He went in to basically explain the same thing he did last week (excluding the parts directed at me). I noticed a distinct thing and again, tried my friend's conflict strategies and reiterated what I think I heard to confirm:

""So, I just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly. It sounds like your issue is less with our friendship and more about your support system as a whole?""

Finally after a short pause, I reach him. He says ""yeah, it is"" with a lifted tone of voice. You know how when someone realizes something that really clicks with them? He said it like that.

It was at this point he started to accept me as on his side. He opened up more about the situation and we investigated it together. Details he hadn't shared with me about his very toxic work environment came to light. He'd been seeking companionship from his colleagues who were rejecting him due to very typical work dynamics (unnecessary to go into). Because of everything he'd been going through outside of work, he was unable to see that he was emotionally investing in people that he shouldn't have been and then the AP vicious cycle of accumulating unmet needs, insecurities of being defective/unlovable, projecting onto the ones that do care, and all of the other shit happened.

By the end, his normal tone of voice and way of talking was back and he even made funny commentary. I was super glad to hear that. He's by no means fixed by our conversation, but he knows I'm on his side and I hope he remembers what we found in our investigation: the people who don't treat him well don't matter and he can change his environment to get out of it.

Big shoutout to my friend who gave me those conversational strategies. It saved my friendship!

**EDIT:** I want to point out that both of my referenced AP friends have been in therapy for a couple  of years. I'm not but I get secondary therapy from everyone who shares advice with me. I think a major DA strength (maybe its not DA and its just mine, thoughts?) is the ability to not personalize things (as much) and interpret things more objectively.

572,What is exactly that in a potential parter trigger your fight or flight mode the most?,"For example: as I look back at my dates, there are people with whole I felt overwhelmed and (very few) people with whom my feelings were free to develop. I’ve always felt triggered by those who showed strong interest in me and seemed in ‘control’ of the situation. I had the immediate sensation of feeling smothered and hated the fact that they were so leading the whole thing. It happened that I regretted them, but only when I saw them with a new SO. 
However, at the same time, I realised how unavailable were those with whom I did not experience that smothering feelings. And felt more at ease doing the chase, rather than chasing them. And the more unavailable, the more the need to chase.

574,Cutting off avoidant ex,"My previous post talked about friendship with my FA/DA ex, and I just wanted to follow it up.

I was supposed to meet him for dinner this evening. Last night he had 'crisis' talks with his current date, and this morning I asked if they were sorted out. He said yes, mostly. This triggered me as he's been talking about how things aren't right between them etc. I decided that, much as other people have already told me, he's just using me for some form of comfort/connection which he isn't getting elsewhere, without any of the commitment. Having done further reading on DAs and exes, this is such a typical situation. The website Free to Attach has really opened my eyes!

I decided that I've had enough - he is being selfish just expecting me to be there for him while I know he is with someone else. I told him so this morning and he got passive aggressive, going on about how he's always been there for me (basically pushing the blame on me and trying to guilt trip me). 

So, I plucked up the courage to say that he has lost me for good, and that I hope he regrets it one day. I then blocked him on social media, WA etc. and deleted everything. It's funny how the avoidant side of my own FA leaning has now been activated, and I want nothing more to do with him. I feel relieved in fact. I have packed up all the stuff he gave me, cards etc., and washed all the bed linen which he most recently used when he slept at mine. I want him gone. 

I know he has deep rooted issues which are not his fault, and that's very sad, but it isn't my problem to deal with and I'm not going to be his comforter when things go wrong. He's damn lucky I stuck around as long as I did.

575,Constant contact {FA},"I am currently in therapy and working on speaking up when I need space or whatever my needs may be in general. The biggest issue I’m struggling with in my relationship right now is constant texting. We live an hour away from each other and typically see one another every 2 weeks on his days off. The week we aren’t together we will have a video chat date to talk and watch our tv show together. Outside of that he likes to always be texting. Some days I don’t mind and other days I just don’t really want to text. I told him I need to be able to miss him but when we text constantly I don’t get that. He suggested a designated day of the week we don’t talk. I don’t think that’s what I need. 

The problem is I don’t really know how to communicate this need. The need is just that I want to not be talking all the time. Just a text here and there. If I message though he will always want to continue a long conversation. 

I did speak up this past week when I didn’t respond to him and he sent another message “where’d you go?” This is normal of him to do if we were talking and then I stop cause something came up. After I wasn’t busy I told him what happened then expressed to him that when he sends another message it comes across as a demand to respond to him. That I didn’t like when he said that and I would get to him when I could. That I still loved him even if I didn’t respond immediately. He told me yesterday that had made him angry because he didn’t want to be seen as demanding and needy. Then when I asked him if he could see how it is needy when I’m busy and can’t get to him he got a bit snappy. I told him it was okay he was angry about it but he needed to ask himself why it made him so angry.

My therapist says I am afraid to speak up for fear he will leave me. Which is probably true but as a fearful avoidant I am always in contradiction. There’s a part of me so suffocated that wants to be free. So it’s a push pull of leave me alone but don’t leave.

579,How can I learn so sleep next to someone I'm dating? {FA},"First time poster here.

I've (30m) known about my own FA style for a few years now. Over the past year I've made lots of progress working with a therapist exploring its origins (mostly being gay in a homophobic environment) and while I'm not completely over all of it, I'm a different person from a year ago.

I recently started dating a guy, and was completely honest about my avoidance upfront - that I'm aware of it and working to understand it better. I tell him when I'm feeling fear, when I get anxious, and he responds with genuine care and empathy (he's pretty clearly secure).

I'm OK with immersing myself into situations knowing my avoidance is causing my fear. I make the conscious decision to do it anyway. But the one thing I cannot do is fall asleep next to him. I'd nod off and jolt awake in a state of hyper-vigilance. Once I feel the fear, it's physical and I can't think myself out of it. I've tried mediation apps, and sleeping techniques, even taking a painkiller, but nothing works.

I've had this issue in every past relationship, and could only ever fall asleep next to a partner if I was sure the relationship was ending soon. To me, sleeping next to someone is a clear expression of deep intimacy, which is why an FA like me struggle with it.

583,To open up.. {da},"So for pretty much all my life I have had an dismissive attachment, where I have been always there for others - cracking them up as to say (getting to know them) but I when they try to get to know me I usually just draw the subject back to them - the best way to push people away is to invite them to talk about themselves, they then talk for days and simply don't ask anything about you. At least this is the way I found.

It turned out that I have become this character, where I am always there, but not my true self - where I know everyone and no one knows me. It is cool at some point, but dehumanizing at some point, after all you are everywhere in a person's life and nowhere at the same time, a ghost.

And well, not too long ago I got tired of it, and wanted to change. My first idea was to open up to some people. What happened is that they literally said: ""ok"". No one seemed to care, and worse than that, people just lost interest in me. That magical character lost is charm, and I became just another faceless human being to their eyes. Just one of many.

After this happened, with the few people that I trusted, I decided to do the opposite. To instead of just being there like a whispering ghost to do my own thing, to put myself as a prize for them to come and overcome. And then people started to valorize me, a lot. The new people that I met tried to figure me out, and even the ones I knew started to look at me with curious eyes.

And ever since, for this last months I guess, this is what things have been, people interested in me and trying their best for my attention or to find things out, try to ""solve"" me. I feel now like a beast keeper feeding them with this or that every now and then, and they love it. The less I give them, the more starved I let them be the more eager they get. 

And yet this is just so dehumanizing. Again. I feel very .. alone I guess.. or something of this kind. I always tried to see people differently, as people, but I can't. They just show day and day that they are just like little machines, puppets. You do this, they do that. You pull this they move that.
It kinda sucks I have to say, because now I feel like hosting a show: where I am the prize - a show to a pound of fish where they behave and go wherever I throw the line.

And this just feels like a game. If I don't play by the rules I just get frustrated, as nothing seems to go right, and if I do, then things loose it's shine: where I need to not get attached and not give them attention for them to come.

584,guilt setting boundaries with AP partner's needs after reading Attached {FA},"I recently read Attached and the book seems to imply that avoidants don't take seriously the emotional needs of others. It also seems to imply that the AP's really just need someone who will reassure them whenever they need reassurance. However, the book doesn't seem to cover how to respond when the emotional needs of AP's become unhealthy, or when they fail to respect or understand the emotional needs or boundaries of others. 

I've loved many AP's in my life and I haven't found them all to be unhealthily demanding, but I'm currently in a situation where an AP is expressing that they don't like my boundaries (which are necessary due to current mental health struggles) and want me to be emotionally available to discuss their pain with our relationship whenever they want to discuss it. 

I don't know how to be firm and insistent about boundaries without feeling like the avoidant jerkwad that the book Attached talks about.

586,we agreed to exclusivity and now I'm panicking {fa},"So the guy I've been seeing is going to be out of town for a month, and I was thinking a lot about what I want during that month. There was a moment I was pretty sure I was done last week, that he just wasn't invested in me and I wasn't trying to be the person who put up with that anymore. But I talked about it and he surprised me in a big way not only in the way that he talked about it but how he actually did things differently after. So i wanted to be more informed about how this time should go, should I keep an eye out and maybe multi-date or should I continue to invest in this relationship like I have been. 

So I initiated a conversation about it and we both admitted that we havent been seeing anyone else and werent really interested in seeing anyone else so we agreed to be exclusive. I was flying high but now I'm having some low grade panic because we were essentially exclusive before we just werent talking about it and now it feels like theres no walking back. But I remember how much I was trying to honor my need for reassurance and some degree of certainty. Now that I know that my feelings are reciprocated for now on some level i think part of me is waiting for the other shoe to drop.",v7pjdi,24,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/v7pjdi/we_agreed_to_exclusivity_and_now_im_panicking_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
587,New to Understanding My Avoidant Attachment {fa},"I’m 25 but only recently recognized that my patterns with relationships completely match the description of the fearful-avoidant attachment style. It’s honestly been really eye opening to read the experiences of so many other people on this sub that basically deal with the same things that I have for years. It both makes me feel hope for myself and others like me and it also breaks my heart that so many people feel this way. 

Like many of the people in this sub I actually have been successful at forming meaningful friendships with people, and have several friendships that are deep where I feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable. But when it comes to romance I have had much less success in overcoming my avoidant tendencies, which mostly comes from myths I have about my own self-worth. I download the apps occasionally and will almost instantly get off, unable to imagine that anyone on there would have any interest in me or that I wouldn’t just eventually push them away. The romantic situations that have happened more organically have been ones where the other person was distant and gave clear signs of not being interested in me, and the best I can figure this also just reinforces the myths I have about myself that rejection is always imminent. 

I can see that my mother holds a lot of the same myths about herself and growing up she also handed me a lot of grief she experienced regarding my father’s infidelity and the death of her parents. I don’t think I’ve ever had a conversation with my parents where I expressed how I felt about anything. Mostly our conversations are about the news, local events, and opinions about these things. My parents also never separated but were never in the same room together growing up, so I tried to mediate as much as I could and generally tried to handle things for myself so that I didn’t force them to have to collaborate on my behalf, something that I knew made them both uncomfortable. 

I guess my point in making this post is just that having realized that this is my attachment style, I really want to work towards stability, and for the first time in my life I’m actually looking to work seriously with a therapist to help me find ways to change my behavior, and I’m curious what steps others have taken to try to live a healthier life. I guess the other obvious reason I’m making this post is because thinking about my life with this frame has been weighing on me and it feels too heavy to take to anyone in my life right now until I can also show them that I’m trying in good faith to make changes to be less avoidant. I know that it ultimately comes down to finding unique solutions to each of our unique experiences, but any words about your own paths would be helpful.

589,I stopped dating 5 months ago and its awesome and other things,"Some background: I am on the ace/aro spectrum and DA. My ace/aro manifests itself as not often sexually attracted, less often attracted romantically. But when both types of attraction is there, I am captivated (amongst DA behavior). I dated frequently from Summer 2020-Fall 2021. I met someone and fell in love at the beginning and was dumped Winter 2021.

I continued to date, learned about AT, spent a lot of time on this forum trying to fix myself.

In the end, I just couldn't find any motivation to talk to someone in a dating/sexual capacity. I finally pulled the plug on dating apps, social media for a short period of time (1 month), and no longer entertain dating.

I still frequently have to turn people down who approach me as a prospect (in real life, on my social media). Approachers seem confused/in disbelief about my lack of interest in it. Some of them don't back off despite my explicit explanation. My newly-earned secure behaviors help me to recognize their behavior as violating boundaries and I either reiterate or stop responding (depends on how much interaction I've had with this person before). I don't owe anyone shit.

I'm feeling pretty amazing like a weight off my shoulders for honoring myself. Its too much to continuously put myself in a situation in which 99% (real figure) chance I will feel zero interest.

Instead, I'm heavily invested in my other hobbies which is fulfilling the shit out of me and I have a new best friend who is quite secure and I get practice getting closer to someone (ngl, its scary but getting better every day).

I still experience random deactivations. Its so weird how that happens still. But I have a clearer picture of what's going on. For instance, if I start feeling like I could cut my loses with my best friend and be fine without her, I stop and realize I've deactivated and can usually trace-back why (a lot of times, its triggered by something unrelated to her but I still feel deactivated towards her and everyone else).

My friendship with her feels a lot like my fears of getting to know someone I'm genuinely interested in romantically. Probably because she's someone I was interested in being friends with and proved that there is so much about her that fulfills what I want versus someone ""adopting"" me and forcing a friendship until I cave. Which I will not tolerate formations of friendships like that anymore. Again, I don't owe anyone anything and I can choose not to form relationships with people simply because I don't want to.

So, I am defo gonna pursue the next person who inspires me romantically. It just might take a long time for that person to present themselves.",tdv94i,25,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tdv94i/i_stopped_dating_5_months_ago_and_its_awesome_and/,AvoidantAttachment,0
590,Can We Talk Early Dating as an {FA} with strong {DA} Tendencies?,"Hi everyone, 

I'm in therapy and have made a ton of progress on attachment and early trauma that led to a lot of avoidance in my relationships. I've always kind of gone it alone and only relied on people in short bursts. Most of my relationships have been short or with unavailable people. Being vulnerable is incredibly hard for me, and I tend to either experience panic responses or deactivation. 

In working with my therapist, I was finally able to get to the point where I can now tell how I actually feel about someone on a date. I've learned how to trust my gut and it was actually saying no to second dates and things when I wasn't feeling it that really helped me realize when I \*did\* feel it. 

But now that I'm beyond the first couple dates with someone, I'm in this totally new territory and it scares the hell out of me. So far I've managed to stay pretty in the moment on the actual dates, but I start freaking out a little the rest of the time. This person has handled it really well, and we've broached some vulnerable topics already so they have an idea of where any distance on my end might be coming from.

All the same, I'd love to hear about your experiences navigating the space between first dates and something a little more steady/established. Any thoughts/tips/lessons learned?

(I'm still in therapy, so I'm of course talking with her about this too. But I've found this group super helpful so I thought I'd post here as well.)

592,"Emotions and detachment, disconnection","Something I'm struggling to figure out for myself and wondering if other people have their own insights when it comes to experiencing your own emotions and also experience another person's emotions in relationships. There are questions I could ask ..

*Do you think you* ***lack awareness*** *of your emotions or is it you are* ***disconnected*** *from them?* *Is it* ***specific emotions*** *that are somehow 'problematic' for you to experience?* *Do you feel that your own emotions are somehow disorganized and so maybe* ***not 'showing up' at the right time in the right place****?* *Is it that you* ***mismanage*** *emotions (yours, sb else's),* ***neglect*** *or even just* ***dismiss*** *them?* 

I have also come across the idea that, for some people there is *""more interest in things than in real emotions and people""* \- I can see a sort of pattern in myself of looking for emotion in external things that interest me (films, music): there are things that can be matched with a feeling inside that could then be activated (a scene in a movie, some music, etc). These external things seem to have helped me connect to emotions where 'real' people might not. 

I struggle when someone shows me a lot of emotion: love, pain, need, anger, .. So all the basics of just being a person and in close relationships we get to see all that. Maybe even feel it. It's just that for me, these stronger emotions will trigger some sort of freeze response that stops me giving the words or the hugs or the care, the affection. Then when sb else reacts to that not coming there's 'shame' and inadequacy and then withdrawal.

With this I am struggling, not showing up where a partner needs me - feel trapped in a loop of ""fear/freeze/shame/withdrawal""

598,"What DA ""fear of intimacy"" and ""deactivating strategies"" actually means","I've seen the question come up many times pondering if an avoidant in someone's life is deactivating because they're ""afraid of their feelings"". I personally think the language behind these fears is misleading. But I dunno, what're your thoughts? Mine:

The influx of AP posts inspired me to write a couple of posts recently describing some of my relationships. It made me realize that in the past when I was much more unaware (and definitely unaware of AT), I was totally disconnected from this idea of being afraid of my feelings, abandonment, etc. As I became more self-aware, the first fears I identified were fear of enmeshment and fear of inadequacy (to love others equally).

If I was more secure in any of those past relationships, would they have worked out? I have no idea because most of the time, I don't know I'm using ""deactivating strategies"" as I've been totally unaware of my feelings or what healthy communication and boundaries look like. Since those situations are in the past, I've lost the opportunity to try to connect with that version of myself to know.

So if any of these exes wondered ""everything was going so well, she must be afraid of her feelings"", the truth is actually, I'm totally unaware of it if that's true.

Fear of enmeshment is the #1 fear. Its the gatekeeper of all the other fears and the one I usually bounce back to.

However in rare cases, there have been other relationships that were healthier and more established in which my fears leaned more towards feelings of inadequacy to love the other equally. I subconsciously register this as an incompatibility between us (again, disconnected from feelings, subconsciously using other deactivating strategies) and that leads to the relationship's demise.

I have had a conscious fear of having actual feelings for someone but that was in a situation in which I consciously didn't want to have them and it was in the past year so nearing my peak self-awareness. So I guess that makes sense. In this case, I guess my mind tries to protect me and I can't feel my feelings anymore (numbness).

Anyway, I think that **if I have a subconscious fear of intimacy or something, I don't really know it because my deactivating strategies are making me think I don't like you**.

600,Avoidant I am. Not who I am.,"Hey all,

So I’ve recently started going back to therapy about 2ish months ago and about a month in, We’ve now been able to put a label on what I feel is to be wrong with me(at least emotionally). Avoidant attachment. Let the healing begin 🤞🏻 

I’m really sad right now, for its been about 3 weeks since I last talked to the girl I’ve been dating off and on for about a year and a half. Btw, I’ve broken up with her three times. The first time was shortly after she said “i love you” to me. After she said that, I just locked up and shut down and eventually broke up with her because I couldn’t feel comfortable saying it back to her. So I silently criticize her in my head and only highlight the things I don’t like about her. Breaking up 3x is pretty crazy I know, I’ve done it to 2 other girls. I break up and then get back with them and then feel bad about it. I go back and things are never the same. 

And let me be clear, I want a relationship. I want to be madly in love with a girl and know that she’s mine. I want that happy story. But I can’t get to that point.  I really really want to. I really do and it’s saddens me that I can’t. Because I’m tired of being alone. 

The amount of pressure it feels like I am under when I am in these relationships. It’s unreal. I’m constantly trying to figure it out and yet I’m just obsessing about figuring it all out. Three weeks since I talked to her and other than feeling sad and lonely, my thought process and anxiety is a lot better. It’s almost nite and day when I’m out of the relationship. I think clearly and more open and talkative. But when I’m in it, I just don’t even know what to say to her. I’m just so in my head and can’t think of anything to say. 

I think I may be bipolar, but I definitely have anxiety and depression. Which isn’t helping anyone... 

I’m trying to figure out if I miss this girl that I am no longer seeing. Actually, her exact words were “do not call or text me unless you want to be with me” she then hung up. I’m trying to figure out if I am just sad because I’m lonely or sad because I miss her. And if she hasn’t closed the door completely, it feels like I’m running out of time and need to figure it out. 

I don’t like this thing about me. This avoidant attachment. I don’t want this emotional barrier, this wall I have that prevents me from just giving into it all. It’s kept me lonely for too long. 

When I’m with her, it feels like this emotional barrier in my stomach that prevents me from letting my guard down. I have thoughts and wants of holding her hand and telling her things, but yet i just sit their locked up like an invalid. It prevents me from thinking, acting and speaking clearly. It’s like I’m constantly holding everything in. You know what’s crazy, like if she’s coming over I get excited and then also fearful on how I should act and be and do and think. 

Because I am anxious and depressed. I want to message her and say everything like this. But I don’t know if I should or not. For I can’t and don’t want to do this again to her. But I’m afraid of how she will move on and be with someone else. 

I’m tired. Of being the guy that these girls date before they find their one. You can’t imagine how much that hurts that you are the one these girls date before they find their person. It hurts. 

Anyways, I hope someone else has experienced this and I hope if you have, you no longer are. All we can do is take it one day at a time. Which the days are long.

601,{FA} how do I stop wanting all the answers before making it official?,"In my last relationship, and all times I’ve talked to someone, I notice being overly critical as soon as it starts becoming more serious. Having parents who had a failed marriage, I am hypercritical and think of all the ways we would not work (to where it’s just picking at flaws and making up issues). Instead of making it official after a few months and having our honey moon stage of bliss, I immediately think about our differences and can’t make it official. This is a pattern I’ve seen. I think about how I’m settling down too early in life and this isn’t my person, and if I like them a lot, I start to think about how they will hurt me one day and I need more information to trust they will be a loyal boyfriend. Thinking about their flaws sabotages this entire process and protects me from ever saying “yes” to commitment. 

I’ve read that the natural progression of a relationship is to make something official, have your honeymoon stage, then 6 months later you start to experience the differences and challenges and it’s no longer surface level. You discuss if it’s truly serious, long term, say “I love you”. 

I am confused that it takes that long to decide if it’s long term AFTER you’ve decided to make it official. My friends have told me that I “want all the answers immediately” which can’t happen unless we decide to date officially and see it through, but how do I calm my mind and decide to date someone when it feels so surface level to me? It feels uncomfortable calling someone my boyfriend if I haven’t gotten to the deeper level.",155xwnp,22,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/155xwnp/fa_how_do_i_stop_wanting_all_the_answers_before/,AvoidantAttachment,0
602,{da} Do you experience this too?,"I've been dating my girlfriend for about 6 months now. She's kind, thoughtful, and overall we've grown in our ability to communicate through conflict. When we're together we're mostly fine and I can get in to a groove where I can do things I enjoy around her. For example, we've gotten to the place where I can do chores or read a book nearby and she is able to relax. Or we can go out for a drink and catch up about our days. Or I can cook dinner and she'll put on music. 

But when we are apart I find myself feeling that I don't want to be with her long term. I'm not excited about the prospect of spending my future with her and while there are no burning conflicts day to day, I don't find myself wanting to do big things - travel, build a family, grow a career, etc. - with her by my side. 

Do you experience this too? Do you have it where the day-to-day is ok but thinking about long term life with your partner makes you feel bored or numb? Or when you're together things are good enough, but when you're apart you're not thinking about them, missing them, or really looking forward to spending time together?

604,{FA} Unsure about whether or not to continue my relationship,"I started off pretty anxiously attached but after a year or so, about when we moved in together, I switched to avoidant. Now we've been together almost 3 years and I'm just always back and forth. Sometimes I think he's great and we could have an amazing life together, other times I can't stand him and yearn to be single again.

I feel like I'm at a fork in the road right now. I am sort of in a unique position where nothing is tying me to my city, it's the perfect time to start fresh, and I'm stuck on what to do. Last night we had a talk about possibly moving to live with my mom because she has a large house where we could have the whole downstairs area, no rent or utilities. But I always thought that would be *my* plan b. If I were to do that I would do it by myself, as a way to get my life together. He wasn't really part of that plan for me. It was more like if we break up, that's what I'll do. But he's actually very interested in it. He said that he loves me so much and would go anywhere with me, which is one of those things that's so hot and so scary at the same time. I asked what he would do if we moved there then we broke up and he said probably move back closer to his own family. I do like that it's easy to ask or tell him anything related to my avoidance and he's never defensive, the relationship feels so much more real whenever we talk about those things.

The thing I can't get over is that I just don't feel ready to settle down. I really miss first dates and falling in love with someone new. I miss traveling solo and having no responsibilities to anyone. I miss just being so free and so connected to myself. In a relationship things become more dull and I don't feel as alive. So I'm just trying to figure out if I should play it safe and have him come with me on my next adventure, maybe it will continue to be boring or maybe it will be what we needed to get more life in the relationship. Otherwise I could do something crazy that I possibly need and break up, start over and do more things on my own.",13yyj59,25,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/13yyj59/fa_unsure_about_whether_or_not_to_continue_my/,AvoidantAttachment,0
605,How do you like to receive love/care {da},"I've had brief periods of time in my adult life where I felt well loved and cared for. They felt like a magical conjunction of me feeling pretty well, feeling open to connection, and one or more other people in my life being particularly nice to me I guess.

Lately I have been feeling more aware of feeling under-loved. As I have been working on being more vulnerable, more communicative, etc., I have brought this up a little with my closest friend and my therapist. But I don't really know what to ask for, I just feel like I want to feel those kinds of feelings more. And I also know that a big part of it is probably that I am still often not really open to that kind of connection and feeling - that people may be treating me in a way that if I was more open to it I would feel more loved and cared for. I don't want to go into avoidant mode and feel like I just need to fix myself, but I also don't want to put that on other people when it's not their responsibility. (It also doesn't help that asking someone for love/care feels on the edge of unbearably vulnerable.)

So anyway, I'm curious if other people here interact with that kind of thing and if so how do you work on being open to connection from your side and/or how do you like to receive love/care from others?",13d10q1,22,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/13d10q1/how_do_you_like_to_receive_lovecare_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
606,{DA} only fall for the unavailable,"Hey everyone, 

I’ve been reflecting a little these past days on who I form strong attachments with or “fall in love” with- I can think of several times in my past when this has happened, but each time only with people who are either unavailable or otherwise wouldn’t work. 

Is this a normal DA / A thing?

One case stands out… I met a girl at work and got close to her, she had a bf at the time… when we were getting close I didn’t feel a massive amount for her but it’s only after she pulled away and decided she didn’t want to leave her bf that I felt heartbroken and that lasted a good 6 months. It’s the only time I’ve really had those strong feelings.  

There are other examples but the pattern seems I only fall in love if the other is somehow unavailable or not right",11nvm2r,24,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/11nvm2r/da_only_fall_for_the_unavailable/,AvoidantAttachment,0
607,{fa} Does anyone else have trouble with thank you?,"""Thank you"" in general makes me uncomfortable (whether I'm saying it or someone is saying it to me), but it's even more triggering when it involves a romantic partner.

I'm definitely uncomfortable letting people do things for me/give things to me, but am appreciative, so I don't know why it's so hard to say 2 words. I try and show it by being excited or mentioning how much I liked something, and I also try to return favors. If someone does a lot for me then I try to return their gesture with one of my own.

If I do something for someone else and they make a big deal about it then I don't know how to respond. I want them to be happy about what I did, but will downplay the effort, or sometimes completely ignore their reaction. Often making the other person feel worse than if I had done nothing for them.

I do have some trauma around ""thank you"" and am not sure if it's that, or if it's the overall expression of vulnerability that makes me uncomfortable.

608,{da} Help or strategies for responding to and reciprocating flirting?,"I recently learned about attachment theory and it’s been transformative in helping me improve my relationships. 

One thing I’m struggling with that I just can’t break through on is flirting. Over and over I (36f) get to a place in new relationships where my new prospective partner sends me flirtatious messages. Not salacious or untoward, simply insinuating they find me attractive or similar. It’s flattering. Simple things like when I mention that my dog is snuggling with me, he will reply “I’m jealous.” But I immediately shut down. The idea of responding in kind makes me cringe so hard I feel physical stress. I’m imagining how he feels… he write something sending a clear message with regard to where he’d like to take the relationship and he’s met with a long silence and then “haha” or a subject change. That must make me seem totally disinterested, which couldn’t be further from the truth. But trying to form a reply in kind yields a literal gag reflex. I simply cannot. Does anyone have any strategies for communicating flirtatiously, or taking baby steps in that direction?

As a side note, I grew up with deeply loving and doting parents. I was one of those kids who was “good at everything” so in my little childhood brain, perfection was my normal state. I encountered major, gut-wrenching, cruel, unbelievable bullying in adolescence and it was the first time I felt like I saw failure in myself. So I didn’t tell my parents or anyone because I didn’t want to admit to an experience that was anything less than perfect. The pattern repeated a few times, even into adulthood.

609,{FA} {DA} How can you learn to tell specifically why you're being dismissive?,"Say I'm in a relationship--any kind of relationship.

I get frustrated at having to do things for another person. Digging my heels in, feeling exploited, feeling used etc. is really common for me and obviously I'd like to work on that...

So, if you feel this way often. Do any of these resonate more than others as the reason why you're frustrated?

1. Deactivating because of habitual avoidance... meaning, no other reason besides persistent low-level fear;
2. Having a boundary that's being crossed somewhere;
3. Not truly loving/appreciating the other person and faking it to keep ~~them~~yourself in ~~your~~their good graces; being selfish. (edit because I somehow wrote it the other way around and did not mean to)

And the real question for you is: **How do you tell which one it is?**

Asking because I have a tendency to be extremely critical of myself and hating that I've lied to myself in industrial quantities over the years. These days I NEED to know why I'm doing anything or feeling any which way. Otherwise I don't know what parts of me to work on.

I'm having a lot of trouble telling the difference here. Whenever my friends and I schedule a meeting, for example, I'm resistant and frustrated at having to go. (I don't express this to them of course!) But when I do go, I end up having a great time... except when it goes wrong which sometimes happen. Sometimes when I get back I realize I pushed myself too far and regret it, but in the moment it was fine. Sometimes I think I just hate everyone and don't want any relationships at all e.g. ""why am I even doing this""...

In all 3 situations though I have to ignore the feeling and just do the thing, but I might be doing it for the wrong reasons. That matters a great deal to me.

611,Trapped feeling in job : to what extend is it relevant to apply avoidance in other domains of your life? {fa} {da},"**Edit : I'd like to thank you all for your feedback dear avoidants, love y'all!**

&#x200B;

Hi fellow avoidants,

One part of my avoidant stance involves hating feeling trapped in some situations where I feel I don't have ""emergency exit"". Obviously, it is a really toxic way of thinking in some area of life, especially in a relationship: suddenly you reach a point when you feel you loose independency, you feel trapped and you leave the person. I'm confident it's a feeling you all will be able to empath with and I'm doing by best to work on that matter.

However, I'm really wondering if we can apply this ""avoidant"" behavior to other part of our lives, such as the career. Generally speaking, in my life, I need to feel ""Growth and progression"" in things I do. It is somehow linked with that ""trapped"" feeling I described above.

Today, in my job, i'm feeling trapped. I have very good working conditions (lot of paid vacations, very good work / life balance, 0 stress). But I find no more growth, excitment in my missions and my day-to-day tasks. To the point that I can no longer find motivation and energy to work on my projects. I don't feel any kind of progression in my skills and especially, I feel like i'm numbing in that position and that if for which reason, one day I need to change job, I won't have interesting skillset for future employers and this is where I feel that I'm trapped.

&#x200B;

What do you think about this? When I'm starting looking for another job with more intersting missions, I feel a relief. But could it be the same relief I feel when I'm in a relationship and that I'm imagining myself leaving the relationship? These secure working conditions (work / life balance, ...) are keeping me in that comfort zone becaus I fear what I could have after that, but it's keeping me in that imconfort concerning the missions and growth feelings..

I'm looking for some insights here, thoughts... I'm a bit confused about all of this and I'm looking for help.

Thank you in advance !",x6am3v,23,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/x6am3v/trapped_feeling_in_job_to_what_extend_is_it/,AvoidantAttachment,0
612,Once I get the ick it doesn’t go away {FA},"My experience is that if I get the ick from someone then there is no coming back from it. 

It often happens in the early stages of going on dates with someone for me. It might be from something they’ve said, done, or their mannerisms or delivery of saying something. 

I used to think maybe I’m being too picky and should give these people a chance and go on a few more dates. Every time I’ve tried this it hasn’t worked. The ick has stayed. And usually worsened. And I just feel super uncomfortable. Even if I try and be more present in the moment, or try and focus on their positives, or put in a boundary about wanting to take things slower. And so I always end up concluding “see, I should have trusted my gut feeling”. 

I know a lot of people on here describe the ick as a deactivation strategy stemming from fears of rejection ultimately. But I just don’t see how that fits for me. I have no attachment to these people. I couldn’t care less if they leave me or not. If I get the ick, I will actively hope that they dump me or lose interest. I feel like my self-esteem is pretty decent. I like myself generally and know there are lots of people out there who will like me (as well as a lot who won’t I’m sure). 

Idk I just don’t tend to think the approach of not trusting the ick and needing to work through it is very helpful for me. I trust it because it’s consistently proven me right. And I feel like not trusting my gut is what has caused a lot of issues in the past. So I feel like actually it pays off for me to buy into it. 

However, it does then mean I’m very picky. The vast majority of people I go on dates with give me the ick. It’s hard to find people that I feel attracted to, but it does happen occasionally. 

I think maybe there could be some cases (typically much further into dating someone) where maybe the ick is a sign of needing to put in a boundary or a sign of being anxious about closeness. But idk the early stages of dating feel different to me. 

Just wondering what other peoples thoughts about this are? Especially regarding the ick in the early stages of dating and whether you should trust it. Or whether you’ve ever had an experience of pushing through it early on and it going away.",wtu5bx,23,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wtu5bx/once_i_get_the_ick_it_doesnt_go_away_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0

It’s weird, part of me couldn’t care less. But also a part of me wishes that I could feel romantically attached to people like other people do. I feel like I’m missing out. It’s not even that it makes me feel sad… I just feel empty. With maybe a pang of anxiety. 

I just feel like I can’t exactly make myself feel emotions that just aren’t there though. So feels like there’s not much I can do.

616,DA Ramblings {DA},"I visited my parents yesterday and along with slowly digesting a bunch of things this entire year, some realizations came to me.

Despite having forgiven my parents many years ago for our past issues, we are not close. Because of our priorities and attachment style history, I feel there is a failure to connect. Its something I accept because I think everyone involved is well intentioned. Our attachment is just not strong. I don't feel the parent-child draw.

And then I wondered if romantic partners seem so significant because they pick up the role our parents play in many ways.

Such as the way a parent might soothe a small child when they're not feeling well. I think generally, there are some personal space boundaries that prevent our friends from soothing us the same way. Or the validation we seek from our parents for accomplishing something. The expectation of the sort of praise and how it should make us feel is more similar to romantic partners than friends.

Like, I just would never want my friend to cradle me and stroke my hair, lol. But I think this is something most people can agree is a common thing a parent or romantic partner would do. Its been said that we look for qualities of our parents reflected in partners and through them, we can reproduce the cycle of life.

I have this memory that I often reflect on of my mother rubbing my stomach when I was unwell as a child. Its an instance in which I relied on someone and they completely made everything better.

Even so, I can't imagine becoming this vulnerable with someone. Being soothed as an adult does the opposite. It gives me anxiety. I'd like to know it'd be different now, but I haven't got this sort of relationship in my life to find out at the moment. But if that memory is a shining example of how it feels to be safe and satisfied, perhaps it means I am rejecting precisely what I want.

We need our parent to survive. They're the ones who made us exist and validated our right to continue existing until we could care for ourselves. They had to care for all of our needs. In my case, since my parents didn't care for my needs well enough, I learned I was not worthy. I don't want to re-learn that through a partner.

At the same time, my upbringing was very oppressive making me feel trapped. Romantic partners also stir up the same feelings.

I often describe that I don't feel feelings of loneliness or of ""wanting a partner"". But I still miss the last romantic partner I had which is approaching ""years ago"" at this point. I think he's the manifestation of my loneliness.

617,Good date. Interesting to observe my reactions. | {SA} {DA},"Things are definitely changing. About a month ago, things got too close to my ex who I had been talking to, possibly interested in rekindling with. He detached, got distant, I’d been anxious and a bit hurt after that for a couple weeks. I put myself out there with him, telling him I’d want to work together on a solution, we could ease into getting closer, we can go back to our existing dynamic for a bit before continuing the serious conversations. Silence silence silence. It sucked. I understood him to be self sabotaging, so I don’t take it personally. Still hurt, etc. 

Well, I went on a date yesterday with someone else. The short version is, I really liked it… though I bet from the perspective of the guy I went out with, he thinks I’m not into him at all, haha. I definitely still have iciness to me, but I was proud of myself for trying to be present, open, and more importantly to try and use the date how it was intended: to find out information about another person and see if they’ll be a good fit for me. That’s the earned security in action. Sure I may have been scared shitless because he’s *really hot and really my type*, but it’s important to bring up the things we’re always afraid of discussing like “what are you looking for” and “do you see yourself wanting kids” and all that scary stuff. If and when we meet up again, I’ll probably have to let him know of some possible dealbreaker secret qualities of my own, which I’m not looking forward to because it’s a vulnerability and therefore a potential rejection. I was fighting back the slightest beginnings of tears and my own emotional walls when he kissed me at the end of the date, and I had to cry a little in my car before driving home— I was overwhelmed. Held it together decently enough though. 

Im also kind of excited. I think this may be what secure people feel like after a promising date. I’m trying not to let my avoidance tell me all the things that could go wrong, or that it’s too much or bad to be excited about getting to know someone after just one date. (Which, it definitely wants me to believe I shouldn’t be excited or kind of fluttery after one date. In the extreme, sure, but feeling good? Not a crime).

There’s also the part of me that feels a weird guilt for “moving on” from my ex so fast, especially if and when he comes back around. but I think that’s one for my therapist.

621,{da} Using the framework of consent and brakes and accelerators to better understand myself,"Most of my life I have just kind of put my head down and tried to plow through life, ignoring my feelings, etc. Since I have started working on understanding the emotional side of myself better I sometimes think about consent/consensus and how I've just been dragging parts of myself through things they didn't want. I feel sad thinking about this, how I've trampled on/been trampled on and continue to do so. I really like the idea of looking at things this way though, and of being aware enough of myself to recognize when part of me doesn't want something and being able to connect with that part of myself and find a consensus and make choices out of that. It's hard though. I imagine with continued practice it will get easier, but even then I imagine there will be times when it feels like I need to make quick choices and won't feel like I have time to sit and check in with myself in that way. So it's been an ongoing process that I periodically drift away and come back to.

Today it came to mind again though, and while thinking about it I also had the idea of brakes and accelerators come up. This is an idea I am aware of from discussion of dynamics around libido (there are a lot of resources talking about it, [here is one I found](http://www.integrativehealthinstitute.ca/libido-its-not-about-the-drive-its-about-the-brakes/) that seemed like a decent intro). The general idea is that there are things that can rev up your libido and things that can put the brakes on and those can be independent of each other. It can be helpful to recognize, for example, that if your brake is stomped to the floor then trying to accelerate things isn't going to be too successful until you find a way to let off the brake.

What occurred to me  today is that it makes sense if the parts of me that I've been dragging along through life have been trying to assert themselves through pushing my brakes (here not talking about libido specifically, but more broadly on life/energy/motivation/mood/etc). And the conscious part of me wants to be productive and survive/grow/get somewhere in life/enjoy myself/etc. and I'm pushing on the accelerator to try and have those things. I make some progress, but it tend to feel hard. I tend to feel unmotivated - there aren't many things that feel compelling to me (at least not for long), I feel lonely but being social usually drains my energy quickly, I feel overwhelmed much of the time, etc. Maybe it would be helpful right now to focus more on that consensus work and learning what I need to start releasing the brakes more and then I can come back to the accelerator in the future if I need to.

Another thought I had related to consent but not necessarily brakes and accelerators is that it would make sense that I tend towards passivity and distraction as sort of a least common denominator for consent - if I rarely have the internal coherence to make more involved choices I will default to making the choice not to choose.",unfqra,23,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/unfqra/da_using_the_framework_of_consent_and_brakes_and/,AvoidantAttachment,0

623,{DA} I recently gave up on a good and healthy relationship that didn't work out and I'm trying to understand and process what happened,"I [25/F] made a close friend last year. We met online but after two months of getting to know each other online, we met irl. We vibed instantly, it was almost shocking how similar he was to me in all aspects. We continued seeing each other and even though we've never officially ""dated"", we eventually started having sex and being intimate with one another. Overall, I've always seen him as a very close friend, not a partner, because there were no romantic feelings involved, but our dynamic has resembled a romantic relationship rather than a platonic one. Things were great, he's genuinely one of the best people I've ever met in my life. Caring, smart, funny, cute and with some exceptional emotional intelligence. I grew very attached to him and we started seeing each other weekly. Things were going swimmingly, we went out and tried new things, we saw new places, supported each other, cooked together, drove together, played games, saw movies, cried together. It was easily one of the most meaningful things I've ever had. 


But a few weeks ago I (who I suspect I might have dismissive avoidant attachment) started feeling a major disconnect with him. To put it short, in a matter of days I went completely cold on him, even though he did nothing wrong. Seriously. He's always treated me with the most uttermost respect and always did things my way. I just suddenly started to feel distant from him and the attachment started to fade. I could feel myself less and less involved until one day there was this big snap and I started to literally see him as a stranger. It felt like major dissociation but just with him. I would look at him and panic and think to myself ""was I ever close to this person?"". These past few weeks were the worst weeks of my life. I cried and cried and cried. I broke things off with him and tried to do my best to explain to him that he did nothing wrong and that I just cannot explain why I feel like this. But ever since I have not been able to feel normal. All I do is cry. I stopped being productive at work and I think I'm going to lose my job. I cannot put my heart into anything anymore. I just feel dead and gone, I feel like emotionally I'm dead but physically I still need to carry on with life. I wake up thinking about him and the first feeling that comes to mind is that feeling of major disconnect that I started to feel with him lately. Almost as if my brain forgot what it felt like feeling connected to him and can only remember the past few (horrible) weeks. I think I might actually have PTSD from it because it's made me unable to function, I have intense flashbacks and it's the only thing I can think about.


I'm sorry for the block of text, I really wanted to vent somewhere where people understand. Many people have told me that I might have a fearful/dismissive attachment style and that people with this attachment style tend to disconnect themselves from people and relationships even when things go well. My main worry is that I might never be able to be friends with him again, and that I'll be left with the trauma forever. I want to mend things so badly and even if we won't have the same type of intimate relationship anymore, I'd be pleased even with just being regular friends but I don't know how to do that when my brain basically rejects him for no reason. I'm curious about what you guys think went wrong, from the perspective of an avoidant. Have you ever mended a broken relationship with someone which ended on similar terms as mine did?

I also know that I tended to bash my DAs because it's easier than taking responsibility for my own emotional needs or at least approaching someone more available, not because they did anything wrong beyond enabling me and getting abrasive when I kept challenging their needs instead of ditching me sooner.

In my avoidant mode, I don't even bother with people at all, let alone people who are dissatisfied with my need for space, so of course I might be unsure about what DA behaviour is toxic just because making people lose interest is kind of the point to me, lol.",rc97xz,23,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rc97xz/examples_of_genuinely_toxic_da_behaviour/,AvoidantAttachment,0
629,What I think of protest behavior and what do you mean?,"**NOTICE:** Let's not let this topic become a thing of bashing between attachment styles.

**Example Situation:** I'm currently experiencing protest behavior from an AP. This guy and I really hit it off and he became a little intense and I've been busy. I communicated to him my agenda and let him know when I was busy and always follow up. Sometimes, its houuuurs before I respond. But its because I'm busy. Yes, I do see his messages. But I'm overwhelmed and do not wish to respond until later.

He's triple texted me. Kinda felt like guilting because he was like ""How was your day?"" which I didn't respond to (I was out) and then a ""Good night"" message. I sent him a meme yesterday and he just liked it. I started a conversation with him and he started it off with saying ""wow, she's alive"" and is pacing his responses.

I know this is protest behavior because he's shown a shit load of interest, told me often how much he's into me, wants to see me, and perhaps he could change my mind about marriage, kids, etc (I've disclosed my avoidant patterns).

**How I feel about it:** Its annoying to feel like someone is trying to manipulate me or acting kind of pouty especially since I've been up front about how I operate (avoidance) and my busy schedule. It makes me feel like leveraging off of his protest behavior and let this fizzle real fast.

Before someone asks me why I'm continuing to engage with someone who I know is AP, its because I've just now decided I've seen enough that they're likely such.

**Question:** What is going through your mind to do this? What are you hoping to happen? What do you think of how I feel about this behavior?",ra6fra,24,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ra6fra/what_i_think_of_protest_behavior_and_what_do_you/,AvoidantAttachment,0

632,be resolute,"i feel so much confusion coming from the users of this subreddit and that’s understandable.

regardless of your attachment style, may i suggest being resolute in whatever you believe?

for instance, the burning question is “does my crush/ex/partner care about me? they did xyz, what does it mean?”.

if you really sit with it, you probably do know. what did your initial gut instinct tell you? it’s probably that. maybe you need to use this sub as a soundboard sometimes but actually it’s you giving the answers.

personally, it helps these days if i decide what someone’s intent is. that way, my reactions are solidly resolute. i know it goes against the whole “it’s dangerous to assume what someone’s thinking”. i think it’s equally dangerous to not trust yourself.

so if you think that your love interest may be showing you interest or rethinking the relationship, believe you’re correct enough to do something. half believing yourself is resulting in you avoiding or it’s got you tip-toeing around, making passive aggressive attempts to uncover the situation. you wanna make sure you tried everything first so you can move on without regret so just do it.

634,"Mental health, avoidance, and finding a way back","Hey Avoidant folks,

I found out that I was Dismissive Avoidant a year (two years?) ago, when I really started to explore my relationship with my mother. Researching a little bit on attachment theory, it really just kind of ""clicked"".

I've always been incredibly avoidant with my mother specifically (little to no personal disclosure), and partners (I'm affectionate, but have a hard time being emotionally vulnerable, and I've abruptly left 2 relationships without much warning). I'm an anxious person, but I don't find myself in the headspace of needing to please, needing to be liked, or fear of judgement. I know people care about me, I just don't always think I'm what's best for them, and have issues with personal disclosure because I don't want other people to do any emotional labour on my behalf.

My DA tendencies didn't show up in my friends too much, aside from a lack of personal disclosure, and having a low social battery, resulting in me disappearing for a couple of months at a time. But I've always felt supported and loved by my friends, I just don't feel comfortable being a burden.

That is, until the past few months. I've been in a depressive spiral, and I've completely avoided all interactions with my friends since April (5, going on 6, months). It's just longest I've actively detached, and it's eating away at me. I feel this torrent of guilt and panic. I check every day to see if they're still my friends on social media, even though I haven't used social media for any public posts in 3 years, because it's the only metric I have to know that they're not mad at me.

But I'm utterly convinced that they're mad at me. I haven't been there to support them. I haven't been a part of their lives. I detached with no warning. I haven't put effort into the friendships and I feel like I've done irreparable damage to the bonds I had.

It makes me hate myself. 

And it makes me hate myself more when someone messages me worried, and I'm paralyzed by anxiety and guilt, and I can't tell them that I'm okay. And then I'm making them worry about me for no reason. I'm just at sitting my house, why is this so hard?

I feel like I locked myself out and I don't know how to get back in. And even if I did, what would I say? I'm so tired from my depression, I don't make a very good friend right now. 

It feels so easy for everyone else.

Does anyone else find that their mental health has made their avoidant tendencies worse? How have you repaired your connections to people after a long time away?

638,{fa} I feel like I like being alone just as much as I like being with my partner. Is that a problem?,"Been in my relationship for over a year now. It's going well. We're planning to move in together in the late fall.

We had kind of a ""trial run"" of living together earlier this summer. Three weeks together in a new city. I was nervous before that about us moving in together long term, but was a lot less nervous after. We butted heads occasionally but overall I was proud of how we negotiating sharing space and belongings, how we resolved conflict, and I really enjoyed having him around all the time. Good stuff.

Now we're in the opposite phase: we're in the middle of a long-distance period of about 5 weeks. So I'm getting to very directly contrast what it feels like to live with him and what it feels like to live without him.

And I'm feeling like...I like them both equally. And sometimes I feel like that's a problem.

Here's how it feels in my head. There are pros and cons to being with him and being alone. And they're about equal, in the end

When he's here, we get to cuddle and have sex, he helps me with the dog, the housework load feels lighter, he helps me stay on a better sleep schedule, we go out and do things much more than when I'm alone.

But when he's here I feel more heightened, always aware that someone else's needs matter, I have to make small, largely inconsequential compromises (e.g. we get the kind of peanut butter he likes because he has stronger feelings about peanut butter than I do), I'm generally more tired because we get up earlier and do more things.

When he's gone, I get to watch whatever I want on TV and not have to explain my day to day doings to anyone, I can leave crap lying around because it won't inconvenience him, I can sleep in later because we don't have to share the bathroom, I generally just feel quieter and calmer.

But when he's gone, I'm starved for physical affection, my night owl brain does bizarre things and my sleep schedule gets crazy, I struggle to manage the dog on my own, I'm more anxious about things like home invasion and walking around alone.

I guess what I'm saying is, it all comes out about the same. I like being with him and being alone equally. They both have benefits and drawbacks. And sometimes I find myself wondering - does that mean I'm not ""in"" this relationship enough? Should I feel like I NEED my life to be with his more than I do? I know there's a line of ""too far"" here - if I were falling apart and unable to function without him, that would be too much. But am I, to put it simply, missing him too little?

Kind of just a ramble that I've been thinking about lately. Would appreciate any thoughts.

Edit: Realizing the attachment theory connection here may be a little unclear. I've been very avoidant for most of my life and just in the last few years have admitted that I need and desire human and romantic connection. So I'm still sometimes trying to parse out what's avoidance and what's just me.",14n9z1a,22,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/14n9z1a/fa_i_feel_like_i_like_being_alone_just_as_much_as/,AvoidantAttachment,0

640,{FA} struggle with believing declarations of love,"So my boyfriend (32m) told me he loved me (39F)

I asked how he could be so sure, and he said because I'm cute and he likes spending time with me and  he can envision a future together.

I'm not really sure what I was expecting, or what if *any* answer would be satisfactory, but to be honest it just didn't feel good enough to me.

Maybe I am over romanticizing love, maybe there isn't a realistic answer that would exist that could be good enough. I think I would had felt better about an answer that made me feel more seen.

His response made me feel interchangeable, like I was just around at the right time.

And maybe that is what realistic love is.

I am coming to the conclusion that people, men especially approach relationships like shopping for a pair of pants.

If you aren't shopping for pants, you are not going to buy pants. They can be the most well made comfortable best looking pants in the entire world, but if you aren't looking for a pair, you just aren't going to bring them home.

But if you decide you really need a new pair of pants, you will go to the store and pick up whatever decent pair you find that fits the basic criteria.

Maybe love for secure people is the same.

If you aren't looking for a relationship, no matter how great a person is, you aren't going to fall in love.

If you decide you really want to settle down and find someone, whoever comes along who is good enough is who you will end up falling for.

Maybe I'm not giving myself enough credit, or maybe he just isn't good at articulating the *why* for how he feels, but if *he* asked me why I love him, I would say things like:

I love him because of the way he treats his friends and family.

The way that he is kind to everyone, even total strangers who can do nothing for him.

I love him because of his ability to admit when he is wrong, how he cares about things that are important to me because they are important to me.

I love how thoughtful he is.

I love his strong chest and blue eyes.

I could go on and on.

Thats why his answer of ""because you are cute and I like spending time with you"" feels kind of shitty.

There are millions of cute people who you can tolerate being around in this world. 

Maybe no one could ever make me feel seen enough.

Maybe I am deactivating and looking for reasons to pick things apart.

641,What is life like after the codependent break up? {da},"I ended a 4 yr relationship with someone when I realized codependency present in the relationship. I was avoidant and they were anxious. 

After that, I had a clearer head and they did too. But we still live together and we are soon to talk about our living situation (moving out together or not) 

They are a gem, they’ve been going to therapy and have really stepped up in the last two months. But I’m still feeling vulnerable like I can only let them in so much. Like it hurts when I see them trying to finally stand on their own and go above and beyond for me because that’s what I’ve wanted all along, and now I’m too hurt to accept it. 

I’m nervous because what If they collapse again and I am not ready to keep them up and pull them out of their depression again ? 


For a majority of the relationship they were depressed and definitely repeated how they had abandonment issues. Of course I never want to cause any one pain but it felt like a lot of pressure to “be the strong one”.  


There are other aspects of course like there’s a huge culture difference between us too that I’m not 100 percent comfortable with. 

I’m scared that I did break up and now it’s the letting go. It almost hurts because why couldn’t they have gone to therapy and started working on themselves sooner? Before I felt so hurt I couldn’t hold them anymore?

643,{fa} Do I have this attachment style because of my dad's temper when I was young?,"Hi all, after noticing my pattern of distancing myself from romantic interests every time I feel like they are getting ""too close"" (and I have done this consistently before a relationship could begin, so I have never dated anyone). I am realizing I (27F) might be FA, leaning towards DA. But the thing is, I did not have an abusive childhood, so I am a bit confused as to how I ended up FA. My only hypothesis is the following:

As a toddler, I spent a lot of time with my dad because he was not working, whereas my mom had a full-time job. He was really present and provided for my needs, but he also had an unpredictable temper and would yell. He also started telling me from a young age that I was not “assertive enough” and that I was ""lost in my own world."" I still remember when he took me to enroll in Tae Kwon Do when I was about 5 to “toughen me up.” He didn’t force me to do it because he could tell I did not want to, but I the memory is still vivid to me. I also have a few memories in which I was crying, but he was unsympathetic and ignored me, or made dismissive comments back. Like one time I cut my head while hiding under a glass table during hide-and-seek, and I went to him for comfort because I was hurt, but he did not comfort me and told me that it was my fault because I should not have been hiding under the table to begin with.

I also wonder if I am more secure in my friendships because my mother was super gentle and compassionate, but because she was working longer hours, I didn’t always get to see her, and my dad’s presence was more consistent. But when I did spend time with my mom, I treasured it. That is how I feel with my friends: I love our time together, but there is also distance. I like the space, but I know I could be more vulnerable and consistent with my friends, too. Meanwhile, romantic relationships, which expect more day-to-day emotional closeness, honestly scare the shit out of me, and I’ve never been in one, perhaps because of the dynamics with my dad.

A note on myself is that I identify as a [highly sensitive person](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/highly-sensitive-person) and am quite impressionable and absorbent of my surroundings, and to the emotions of others, so as a kid goodness knows what I was internalizing. I have a younger sister who is not as sensitive as me and is more assertive, and I'm pretty sure if she took the attachment quiz she would get Secure.

Anyways, I know figuring out the ""why"" is not as important as dealing with how FA manifests for me in the present, but I suppose I am still processing this information. I am also asexual (ace), and because of my anxiety around romantic situations, I thought I was also aromantic, but now I am leaning towards the possibility that I am FA.",zz4pwu,22,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/zz4pwu/fa_do_i_have_this_attachment_style_because_of_my/,AvoidantAttachment,0

I was dating a person who's also an FA but is quite good at working through to become secure. He is really good at bringing up boundaries and his needs but also encourages me to do the same before I ""blow up"" which is hard.

With this, he tends to get frustrated when I don't open up because I do blow up and that causes me to deactivate because he will bring up that I am bottling things in.

When I bottle things in and he calls me out on it, it causes me to deactivate and want to run away even more. When I said he gets frustrated I don't mean he's angry he basically just begs me for communication.

Does anyone know why I'm deactivating with a person who wants me to become a better partner?

ETA:

I should probably be honest, he's actually no longer my ""partner"" we were dating and I ended it earlier this year. I felt ""rejected"" when he didn't want to have sex early on. He reached out a few months later and we had hung out and I led him to believe I was having a fantastic time ( I really was, but he did very intimate things that made me uncomfortable like holding my hand and brushing hair off of my face) I didn't realize I was uncomfortable till a few days later and when he had reached out I had ignored him. A week later  we got into a ""fight"" (with him it's actually a really controlled discussion which is really nice actually)

After we agreed to take some space (3 weeks) and I had ended up ghosting him. Our fight was regarding me acting like everything was fine the entire night, then going distant for a week and then him just shocked I wasn't actually fine, and ready to deactivate/leave again while I was making future plans with him throughout the night and giving him mixed signals.",y2zacm,21,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/y2zacm/partner_holds_me_accountable_and_that_causes_me/,AvoidantAttachment,0
646,I {fa} don't know if I am missing some intellectual compatibility,"So I've been in a relationship for 2 months and have just started my healing process of my FA. There are many things I like about my partner. She is kind, cute, whacky (in a great way), funny and we both feel very comfortable with eachother (don't feel the need to wear nice clothes or for her to put on makeup all the time).
There are some things in the relationship which I thought was bad but have managed to be more accepting of, and though they trigger me sometimes, I can get out of that thought trap. Such as, when she acts a bit too much like a baby sometimes, doesn't have a large overlap with my hobbies and interests etc.
But there is one major thing that I find hard to shake off, and that is: I feel we are on a different level when it comes to our conversations. I don't know exactly what it is, but it feels like I need to explain things to her in more detail than I need to with anyone else (that I actually bother to explain to). I have some great conversations with my mates and I feel comfortable/natural going really deep on the topics we choose to talk about, but I don't have this with my partner.
I remember talking to her on our first dates, and we do talk of course and joke around a lot via text, but it feels like I'm missing something.

647,{FA} What's your preferred mode of communication for difficult conversations ?,"I am trying to figure out how communication styles differ over the spectrum of different amounts of avoidance being discussed here. I am asking this because I don't want to run away from a match in the future as long as we don't have completely different preferences.

- What would be a big incompatibility for you in terms of modes of communication ? 
- What would be an ideal common ground for you besides avoiding the conversation ? 

I dated someone (DA/FA) who preferred to have all major conversations/conflicts over text. For me,  texting is for hangout logistics with my friends and if there's a difficult conversation, I prefer to have it scheduled and in-person. I honestly don't believe someone's texting frequency is a good indicator of someone's interest in me as long as I get a reply within 24 hours. 

Looking back, I know I should have walked away when it was obvious our communication styles were different.

649,"{DA} But WHY should I change? Genuine question, looking for answers","I'll start off by saying that romantically I have a long-term, securely-attached relationship, and I'm so grateful for that.

Now non-romantically, with everyone else? Why is it bad to be DA? It feels incredibly logical.

I'm the people pleasing DA. Female, in my 30s.

Here's the situation that brings up the question. I've reconnected with someone in my family that I used to be close with, and found myself getting triggered as she immediately was coming on strong and trying to be super loving in a way that I know is just temporary, conditional emotion.

Here's the thing with her, specifically. We had a conflict years ago that blew my mind. I walked on eggshells like crazy during this conflict, wrapped everything in apologies, kept my own emotions down, spoke in I statements... and she still became incredibly irrational, refused discussion, expressed rage for me not being as similar to her as she thought, and swiftly disowned me.

Years later, this woman wants a personal relationship/friendliness where we can hop right back into being emotionally expressive and pretend it's real? I know I'm DA, but that's still not healthy.

And it's not like this is my only experience. I've had another friend who flew off the handle when I wasn't pleasing her on some issue, and it devastated me. The people who know the whole story all agree it was messed up, so it's not like I'm trying to pretend I'm always the blameless, I was actually wronged.

I had a friend of many years who felt weird to me but I was trying to be healthy and open. She turned out racist and used me for her weird white savior fantasy.

I had a best friend for years who turned out to be a covet narcissist.

I don't connect deeply with people because the majority of people are pathological, self-serving, irrational, and only want to ""do"" feelings of closeness and emotion with you because emotional experience feels good. But it doesn't mean much. Many people want you to be the same person as them and only like you when you appear to be. They want you to stroke their ego. They want to use you as a dumping ground or to give them what they can't give themselves. Everyone wants something FROM you, even when they're loving like my first example, it's an emotional high they want to be in and have you contribute to.

653,{fa} I am scared that I will be treated the way I treat myself.,"An insight that occured to me just now when meditating. I really am scared in relationship that someone else I love will treat me the ways I unconsciously treat myself. 

I notice my brain gives me a lot of intrusive thoughts and scenarios when I'm crushing on someone, or dating them etc. Thoughts about ways I'm going to be hurt, or hurt them, ways I'm going to be judged. Arguments that might arise. Red flags about them I don't like. Most of these ways I fear are honestly just me projecting how I feel about myself onto them and being cruel to myself in my head by putting the cruel words into a hypothetical scenario. But honestly I feel those ways about myself already and subconsciously treat and act about myself from those ways of being valueless etc.",vo0un8,23,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vo0un8/fa_i_am_scared_that_i_will_be_treated_the_way_i/,AvoidantAttachment,0

655,I dismiss other people’s feelings if I feel like I’ve been through worse {FA},"I often find that when people tell me about difficult things they have been through or are currently going through, I tend to be very dismissive if I perceive myself to have dealt with worse. 

In my head I think like “yeah well I’ve been through worse” or “at least you didn’t have to deal with x, y, z” or “at least you had x, y, z, sources of support… I didn’t”

Of course I never verbalise this. I’m outwardly very validating towards people and seem empathetic. But it’s often the inner narrative in my head. 

I think it’s a large part due to feeling bitter and invalidated myself. I have experienced some unusually bad things in my life. But either never told anyone or even when others knew, I had very little support with it and so had to deal with things on my own. I think I therefore tend to view people as weak if they can’t cope with things alone. Even though logically I know that’s not true and a toxic way to think.

My dad was always like this to me - dismissive, always saying how he had it worse, and just pretty emotionally neglectful overall. I feel like I think like him. But I’ve always hated that about him and don’t want to be like that myself. I therefore avoid ever expressing these thoughts and try to be outwardly empathetic instead (which I think I’m generally pretty decent at). 

Anyone else experience this? And anyone got any tips for how to genuinely think more empathetically?",ukvshx,21,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ukvshx/i_dismiss_other_peoples_feelings_if_i_feel_like/,AvoidantAttachment,0
656,Some good podcast episodes {FA},"Been really delving into the podcast Therapist Uncensored and damn, are there some good episodes and moments in here. I referred to [the episode on disorganized attachment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u9uc0o/good_podcast_on_disorganized_fa/) in an earlier post here with some personal reflections. 

I listened to [the DA episode](https://therapistuncensored.com/episodes/replay-tu59-are-you-cool-or-just-cut-off-dismissing-avoidant-styles-of-relating-in-adulthood/) too and it was pretty good! Worth a listen, and made me realize that I have been so damn DA for most of my adult life. One thing that really resonated for me was saying that we need to feel that people are happy to see us. They said that those partnered with a DA could do well to make a particular effort to emote, smile, hug, ""light up"" when they see us and this helps create safety. God that would feel so good wouldn't it. 

Here's some more episodes and notes: 

[This episode on CPTSD](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/therapist-uncensored-podcast/id1146941306?i=1000536535624) was great. Dr. Daniel Brown is a very seasoned researcher. My biggest takeaways were:

* CPTSD essentially seems to be someone with disorganized attachment who also happens to have developed a major dissociative disorder, classical PTSD, or some other mental illness compounding their original attachment wounding.
* Children with disorganized attachment are generally the most susceptible to childhood sexual abuse, which isn't surprising, but the second most susceptible group was *fascinating*: secures leaning dismissive. The security they gained kind of installed the longing for connection, but the neglect they experienced that lead to the dismissing behavior leaves a huge hole that they want to fill. Then, their avoidant and disconnected tendencies keep them from actively remembering, processing, and therefore speaking up about the abuse. 
* He discussed his treatment approach for disorganized folks in some detail which was wonderful to hear about, and in general was very clear that each attachment style has it's own very specific needed approach, which makes me want to work with someone specialized in disorganized attachment in the way he was talking about.
   * One of the ways he discussed is the ""Ideal Parent"" method, which Diane Poole Heller also touched on in the [The Power of Attachment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40629898-the-power-of-attachment?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=qu64NtHVrc&rank=1). It's essentially deeply imagining what it would've been like to have the ideal parent—one who was able to meet your needs as a child and who created a sense of safety, attunement, exploration, etc. in the household. Heller specifically talks about deeply imagining what it would feel like now, as an adult if your parent(s) were fully resourced—I.e. if they had everything they needed in life and were thriving, and didn't ""need"" you, but were delighted by you anyway. I remember very very briefly engaging in that thought exercise when I read that book, and having an insanely unexpected intense experience! So I'm interested in revisiting it myself. 
   * He generally said that most people can kind of heal from disorganized attachment with his approach(es) in about two years.
* This guy says that in general preoccupied and dismissive types will tend to move straight towards security, where as disorganized types might swing the other way first, or go back and forth a bit on their way. Makes sense to me, though I'd wondered if DAs/APs swing the other way first because it can often seem like it—any of you have thoughts/experiences/research on that?
* He said that DAs are ""the most satisfying to work with"" because once they reconnect to the natural human desire for love and connection it can be a rapid recovery/transformation—which I experienced with my own DA-ness! :) The challenge is getting them to want to do the work, to see what the problem is, to see what they missed/are missing in the first place. Seemed to indicate that APs are a slower process of painstakingly learning to soothe themselves, etc. 

&#x200B;

This [episode on attachment and narcissism](https://therapistuncensored.com/episodes/tu143-fear-of-abandonment-and-narcissism-with-dr-ramani-durvasula/) was also fascinating (and... validating):

* She's been studying NPD for 20+ years before it was a hot-button topic so she really knows her shit
* In talking bout correlations with NPD and attachment styles, she says DAs are kind of ruled out, because they don't feed on people—they don't need people (supposedly), they can isolate, self-regulate, they can only have one or two close friends or just a hive of light acquaintances... whereas those with NPD cannot isolate, can't self-regulate, need a lot of people and need them close, etc. 
* She says if anything, she has seen more of a correlation between anxious preoccupied attachment and NPD because of the tendency to create closeness with people at all costs for self-serving purposes etc.

659,Good Podcast on Disorganized {FA},"Just wanted to share [this great episode](https://therapistuncensored.com/episodes/tu-161-its-not-crazy-its-a-solution-to-an-unsolvable-problem-disorganized-attachment-replay/) on Disorganized attachment.

It helped add a little clarity/nuance to my particular situation as well as some general confusion I think people have with it. I think people often get it in their heads that *abuse* has to be present, or a really acutely threatening parent/household or something for disorganized attachment to occur, because of some unfortunate lack of clarification in popular texts when they inevitably brush over the style. Diane Poole Heller in The Power of Attachment clarified a little bit when she said that a fear*ful* parent can do it, just as much as a fear*some* one (I.e. a parent who lives in fear and injects a lot of fear and insecurity into the household/relationship not by threat by by their own cowering.) But this episode added that this can also happen with *a parent who becomes upset/dysregulated when the child becomes upset/dysregulated*. That parent is no longer a safe person, and is ""threatening"" to the child because they have no where to go with their own dysregulating, there's no solution to their problem. There's no source of support, no container, no one co-regulating.

This really set off a big, loud bell for me personally because my mother is that to a T. Anything that happened to me in my life, she felt so acutely that I ended up having to caretake her. I stopped expressing things and sharing early on because I didn't want to have to manage her emotions in response to my emotions. Even when my best friend died (this person was basically my *sibling*, we were inseparable from jr. high through my senior year when she died), I remember sobbing and sobbing, and then getting in the car with my mom so she could drive me to her family's house, and my mom was sobbing and sobbing, so I just stopped and stared blankly and couldn't feel anything anymore. It's like she steals my feelings. This is enmeshment obviously and I know enmeshment/neglect form the base childhood experience of avoidance, too. My biggest upsets and traumas, even to this day, always become about her and her experience. Tears well up in her eyes and she says, ""I did the best I could."" 

Even positive things, she reacts with fear first and foremost:

""Mom, I got that job I've been hoping for!"" ""Well... maybe you shouldn't quit your other one yet, what if you hate it and then you're stuck?""

""Mom, I've been in contact with that person I'm interested in, we're spending a lot of time together and it's been nice."" ""Is that really a good idea? What if it doesn't work out...""

I've never quite understood why I speak in a low, monotone voice to my mother and am so unexpressive in her presence. I sit still a lot, don't gesture too much or emote, and am choosey with what I share. Super dissociated and dismissive. I did the ""emotional cut off"" approach from adolescence into my early twenties (this is part of differentiation theory, a coping mechanism.) In later adulthood I've made more of a point of sharing myself anyway, and just kind of shutting it down when she emotionally hijacks or reacts with fear, asking for support instead, etc. (when I do, she says things like, ""of course I support you!"" in a tone that says ""how could you think that I don't?! Do you think so low of me..."" and then gets sulky.) There's no real way to be healthy in this dynamic, I've tried so many approaches and honestly at this point have just made peace with it. But it's nice to get deeper and deeper understanding.

There's also an episode on dismissive that I haven't listened to yet but will.",u9uc0o,21,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u9uc0o/good_podcast_on_disorganized_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
660,{fa} Anyone notice they behave avoidant outside relationships too. Like even at work?,"Been dealing with really bad tooth pain the last week or so. Over this weekend I sent my work group text 3 or 4 messages saying I should get this looked at at an emergency dental place and then deleted the messages soon after. I keep blowing hot and cold on the idea. This pain isn't severe enough, don't bother your coworkers, oh shit no it's definitely bad enough, nope it's manage now. This kind of back and forth has been something I notice I do at work as well when I'm faced with something I worry is going to upset or bother other people. 

I can't ask that of people. I don't want to bother them. I need to tough it out etc. In reality I should just make a quick solid decision yes I'm doing this and ask. Instead I tend to vacilate back and forth and upset people much more. I don't always do this I've gotten better but I notice it's a habit of mine and just realized it's very similar to the push pull of avoidant behavior in a romantic setting.",u5rwxh,22,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u5rwxh/fa_anyone_notice_they_behave_avoidant_outside/,AvoidantAttachment,0
661,Love? Nooooooooooooo!! | {DA} {SA},"There’s someone in my life I care for a lot. To spare needless detail, we were together once and didn’t speak for many months after that ended. We reconnected in October after I learned about AT and saw his avoidance wasn’t intentional abuse and cruelty toward me. I expressed an interest in reconnecting romantically, but he chose not to pursue that at the time of discussion. Between some talks, things hes directly told me, and things I’ve observed, it has very little to do with disinterest in me. Instead, it’s large parts very stressful and sad family troubles he’s been weathering, as well as (from my perspective) some stock-standard avoidant patterning. And, likely rebuilding trust in me after I was a horror show of an FA the first time around. In the mean time now, I’ve been minding my business, allowing him to manage those situations, and living my life as it comes lately. 

He texted me three days in a row last week, which is a record since we’ve been back in contact. While talking about him to my friend, she helped me realize that I’m definitely in love with him. And she’s totally right. I’d spent my mental energy saying “well, I wouldn’t say I’m in love but I have feelings” or other similar thoughts to avoid the truth that I do still love him. Sitting with this has been a challenge. In true avoidant fashion, I thought by telling myself I don’t love him it would make it so. But it’s not true. 

*goddamn it. Nooooooooooo*.

The observer in me notes some interesting things in this situation. Despite loving him, I don’t have to do anything. We do not *have* to be together. It will be sad, but not kill me if we do not ever have a relationship again. The briefly increased contact and my own recognition of feelings has made some anxiety surface. My instinctual conclusions are very telling. “This will never go anywhere”, “this will end as soon as you ask for more”, “he will never be interested in working to build a relationship with you”. And yet, the needle *is* moving. 

Isn’t it weird how those thoughts surface after *more* contact than usual? After I plainly reminded him that I like him, and he didn’t push me away like he did the last time? The observational part of myself continues to be curious and to see what happens next. 

I’m toying with the idea of sending him a letter. Not to confess my love or some other unhinged thing, but to gently express how I see our dynamic, and offer ideas for what we could do differently. To just share what I’m feeling, I guess. What a concept. I used to write him letters when we were together, though I cringe at the thought now. They were definitely anxious and unstably grasping for connection at the time. It seems now even writing something thoughtful and deliberate  would be overbearing, or like it’s trying too hard… but really, I think I’m just ashamed at my own attempts at and needs for vulnerable intimacy. My mind has so many twisted tricks for sidestepping showing my real self, but I have to keep trying in as measured a way possible whenever it’s evident I’m stifling myself in relation to someone else. Balancing this with the understanding that someone is going through personal tragedies as well as the fact that I can’t “do someone’s work for them” makes relating feel like neurosurgery. I often get the impulse to quietly give up, to leave it up to others, knowing it will fizzle out. Is that right though? Is it allowing myself true agency?


I’m not sure I really need advice or input, I’m kind of just living in the moment and organizing my thoughts. Still, I thought it might be interesting to express some of the stuff I’ve noticed coming up for me in later stage growth and what that’s like.

663,I feel like I don't deserve anything and that no one owes me anything,"It's hard to open up about myself because I already have this mentality that sprouts from my childhood trauma that I don't deserve to be loved or for someone to deal with my emotions or behaviors. That no one truly cares about how I feel and it's a burden for them to try to be my free budget therapist when they didn't sign up for it.

That no one deserves to have to deal with my insecurities and flaws, like me being avoidant. They don't owe me any tolerance nor do I even deserve it since I haven't changed at all from my own trauma when everyone else learned how to cope and move on in healthy ways while I failed at it.

To me, it feels like people's love and attention are unreliable and flimsy where no there's no guarantee in conditional love. I might give them respect and kindness, but they can just choose to betray me. That everyone has freedom of choice, sure ethically and morally it may seem unjust. But they still are able to do it without ever facing any consequences, therefore I don't ever want to risk it to ever be hurt by them.

I can't trust them because of the ever-looming possibility of them hurting me, so I don't have any high expectations for someone not to betray/hurt me. Therefore I always self-sabotage all my relationships before they can hurt me.

This even means it's harder for me to get into relationships with others because I believe that I shouldn't even try. I mean why even try to look for a thing I fear and only brings me harm?

The fact that I rely heavily on people to make me happy is distressing to me because 1.) no one is responsible for my happiness, but me and that they don't deserve the burden, and 2.) I know full well I can depend on myself to fulfill that need for happiness without needing others and I know I don't want to be dependent on a person alone for my own happiness.

I wish I could just get over this feeling that all my relationships with people have to only be positive without anything negative that can drive people away, but old habits die hard. I don't know how to become vulnerable and stay vulnerable without me taking it back and deactivating.

I know this is my trauma speaking and I want to get over it, but it feels like an upward battle on pushing a boulder up a mountain. I'm exaggerating, of course. It's not impossible, but it just seems too challenging for me to even try to change. Don't get me wrong I do want to change despite all the self-doubt I have, I don't want my past to control me because it doesn't define me as a person.",soy39t,22,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/soy39t/i_feel_like_i_dont_deserve_anything_and_that_no/,AvoidantAttachment,0

665,What coping mechanisms did you develop on top of avoidant attachment? Did you pick up things to push people away further or delve more into your own mind?,"I'm just listing some of mine, and casting a wide net and including some abstract ones, not all of these are pathology and many are healthy (some are my best qualities) but when done excessively can be a clue that I'm propping it up to block human connection:

&#x200B;

1. Workaholicism: This one is easy. Working too hard + a side hustle should ""accidently"" push people away.
2. Limerence:  Connecting with someone in your mind: no risk of abandonment. An extention of this might also be a fixation on ideas about Romanticism and true love.
3. Obsessed with hobbies / learning new things: can't break my schedule to connect with people, it would put me behind on what I'm trying to accomplish /s. If someone calls me I would get annoyed becuase I have spend time on my program of x,y and z.
4. Working nights: night shift crew is so chill though
5. Obsessed with exercise: really focused on being more worthy, good escape, mostly a solitary activity
6. Copependency: I've always done caretaking for others needs and neglecting my own. It's a sleight of hand...you are seemingly very close to the others but your own emotional world is  banished far away (where it's safe). Mostly with family dynamics, but I work in healthcare too.
7. A bit of narcissm: I have ideas that I'm going to be a world-changing big shot, and that solving world problems rests on my shoulders. I think it's part of being an army of one, low sense of worth that I need to prove worthiness to get accpetance from people and God.
8. Internet addiciton and parasocial interaction: discord, reddit, information addiciton, small social sips really satisfy my thirst for connetion in the short term. Validation with no risks.
9. Obsession with money and financial independence: I think it's partly about never needing help from anyone ever.
10. Becoming very spiritual: Not sure how much this relates to my avoidant attachment, but spirituality was one way to cope with trauma and gave interactions with a relgious community a certain structure, can also stay away from certain people for being too sinful! Romanticized certain distant spiritual circles that I would eventually join (smh)",s37tn0,22,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s37tn0/what_coping_mechanisms_did_you_develop_on_top_of/,AvoidantAttachment,0

668,Dating Stage of a Relationship: Distinguishing between one's avoidant strategies vs a genuine recognition of lack of compatibility?,"Without going into specifics and instead trying to keep this as a general question, I find myself pulling back from someone after a few months of getting to know them.

On the one hand, I am aware of my (Fearful) Avoidant tendencies but at the same time, seem to have a pretty clear sense of actual incompatibility with this person.

And yet, trying to get clarity on what is an actual and real concern about incompatibility versus just my avoidant strategies kicking in, hasn't been easy. Throw in some guilt about letting this other person down, and it's a bit of a internal minefield!

The situation for an FA seems further complicated by the strong desire for closeness and connection that underlies the fearful-avoidant type and this feels like it might be overriding the rational conclusion that my partner isn't likely to ever meet my relationship needs.

So there's a lot internal ""tension"" between these competing motivations: the desire to seek connection (especially as I find this person attractive and have had a crush on them for quite a while) versus the avoidant strategy of pulling back as closeness is attained versus a rational realisation that this person can't actually meet my intimacy needs and isn't actually available and that the sensible thing is to call it off.

If I reality check this with friends, I get a lot of validation that my new love interest isn't really available and that I'm in a very one-sided affair, with not much mutuality or reciprocity from them.

I should add that my dating partner is actually more avoidant than me, and so I have polarised to a more anxious-preoccupied style I think, and maybe this post is even proof of that!

TLDR: how do we get clear that what we are experiencing in relationship with another is actually a warning sign of incompatibility versus us disengaging as part of an avoidant style? How might the FA desire and yearning for closeness complicate this discernment between the two?",qqr78k,21,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/qqr78k/dating_stage_of_a_relationship_distinguishing/,AvoidantAttachment,0
669,i hate how i want emotionally unavailable people,"i noticed i started liking this girl when she ghosted me for a few months and when she finally started messaging me again, i just kinda ... forgot about her? and didn't talked to her much.

then the very same girl, got a gf, and i was so pissed off and wanted to be with her so badly. and then guess what? when i found out they broke up, i just got bored of her and wasn't thinking of her as much as before.

i know this stems from having an emotionally unavailable parent and you craving that same unattainable feeling from other people. but it's such a horrible trait to have. i don't want to date other people simply because of that. and what if i start dating married people and make things messy? i don't even know what to do.",paocic,22,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/paocic/i_hate_how_i_want_emotionally_unavailable_people/,AvoidantAttachment,0
670,I don't understand what I'm feeling,"In my relationships in which I'm DA, I just can't understand what I'm feeling many times. I really do sometimes spend a looong time thinking about them trying to understand. Many times, I can't find the answer even though I really want to.

Someone here sent me a chart that helps identify feelings and it literally is so elementary and yet super useful to me. Thanks again.

If I'm talking to someone new, they're clearly into me, and start putting on perceived emotional ""pressure"", I shut down because I'm trying so hard to figure out whether or not I feel similarly. And then the other person pushes more for an answer or makes more advances and I feel more urgency to understand how I feel so I withdraw more. I know the person is worth exploring more but I don't know how to express where I'm at because I'm not sure. If the person is an anxious type, this is where they start losing their shit. How long does it usually take secures to realize they like someone and want to explore them more anyway? And how do you manage the other person's expectations while you're figuring this out? People just move too fast, it makes my head spin. Sometimes I feel like I might be able to form feelings for someone but it doesn't happen because this scenario of pressure/shutting down happens.

This same thing happens every time I'm feeling things that I don't understand in regard to romantic relationships even committed ones.

I will spin wheels for weeks or even months trying to understand my feelings and a lot of the times, I never do until its all over.

671,For those who are trying to become more secure from avoidant,"An analogy that helped me was to imagine that logic me and emotional me are both in a car. Logic me had the steering wheel but logic me wouldn’t get very far without having to collaborate with the map-reading emotional-me. Instead of fighting for one or other to take precedence or the driving seat with the other in the back being silent, they can work together. Now to start with, it’s hard and clunky; how much power does the driving seat versus the passenger have over one another? What if it’s uncomfortable changing the dynamics? What if we take a wrong turning? What if the driver has to switch places because they got tired? But that’s okay, because it’s part of the process of stream-lining the driving (becoming secure). It’s okay to switch the driver at times, and the sat-nav can re-calculate, as long as the one in the passenger seat can help guide and instruct and map-read.

I’ve kinda worked out that the logic-me isn’t worth battling the emotional-me, because logic me needs the emotional-me. Emotional-me is more important than logic-me gives her credit for and can (and should!) guide important decisions such as in relationship and friendships etc.

I respect their need regardless of the whats, whys, and hows. Though I am curious: When someone who has avoidant attachment takes a week of space (no contact, etc.), what happens in those 5 days? Or rather: What decides the timespan of 5 days or 2 days or 2 weeks? Is the timeline a steady break of just playing sports, playing video games, getting work done, where every day is more or less equal? Or is there a process happening, where day-by-day, healing happens? I guess I am wondering how someone with avoidant attachment knows that they are ready to come back and talk to the person they are avoiding?

We're in couples therapy, both done some individual, haven't found good individual therapists yet. I'm starting a new one Monday, came recommended by our couples therapist(I asked for the recommendation), have high hopes. Together 2 years, broke up for a few months in 2021, got back together at the end of the year. That's actually when we learned about AT. We live together now.

We're both increasingly triggered and the dynamic is ruining us, to the point that it's affecting our jobs and lives. She's constantly feeling unsafe that I'll leave her, I'm constantly feeling unsafe that she'll complain about me or force me into an unpleasant conversation.

She refuses to accept ""I don't want to talk right now"" and says hurtful shit, I'm withdrawing more and more, and when I'm not withdrawing, I'm yelling. Or she is(though much less). At this point, every interaction is a fight, we don't even act as if we like each other, let alone love each other. I realize that deep down, we do, but I also feel immense anger and am fighting a growing urge to just shut down, hide out and take care of myself.

I'm going to spend the weekend working because I'm behind on work due to our shit. As such, I'm pissed off and have been asking for space - I spent last night repeating, over and over, that I don't want to talk. This morning, she told me a friend of hers passed away, and she's currently at the funeral - we couldn't even band together for that. I did offer to go, and asked if I can help her today, but she said no. Of course, I'm feeling guilty about that too.

677,Anxiety and chemistry {da},"Hi everyone,

I’ve been trawling through this forums recently and posting a few times looking for help with my relationship. 

Someone had said that ‘the spark’ of a relationship is actually your attachment style activating, which made me think about the levels of anxiety in making commitments and whether that is a sign that someone is right (or wrong ) for you. 

I had gf in the past who I ultimately left, but, in one example I can think of- I felt great talking to her, getting close, but when she suggested we move in together (temporarily ) and make things official I got incredibly anxious and shut down completely .

I’m posting at the moment (and apologies if anyone is following all these various posts) , about my current gf who I think I don’t like enough, but one of the hallmarks of this relationship has been how it has been quite smooth, I don’t feel a massive amount of anxiety in progressing- it’s more a lot of doubt and I guess a sort of Luke warm feeling towards her. I’m also displaying a lot of avoidant strategies like limiting the time with her etc. 

I’m basically posting a lot because I think I Don’t like her enough and I’m wasting her time but I wondered if the levels of anxiety I felt for my ex was a sign that actually she was someone I was more excited about ?

681,"{da} Self discovery, feelings regarding being DA, DA-AP struggles and venting","Dear Avoidants and Curious Non-Avoidants,

first and foremost I would like to thank you for being you. I joined just a couple of days ago because I felt like the worst person on Earth. I read a couple of posts and comments and I think, you guys have absolutely no idea how much you helped me to accept a bit more the way I am so thank you!

This is a self discovery story time with a hint of venting. It'll be long, I apologize in advance. I really need it out of my system and sharing it with total strangers seems to be a good idea, right?- Eh.

Me and my bf just recently discovered AT. I suspected earlier that I have some kind of serious issue. I knew it was something to do with my attachment but couldnt really pinpoint it exactly, somehow I just didnt stumble across this exact thing 'avoidant attachment' or 'attachment theory' and honestly didnt even take it that seriously. I just felt something is off. What I figured back then was that I have a fear of intimacy issue. Almost nailed it.

Our relationship is the classic, textbook DA-AP relationship with an extra, long dinstance added to it. Honestly the whole thing would be an amazing teaching material. It's a rollercoaster. Like a proper one (like Red Force or Shambala). It is extremely exhausting but non of us is willing to give up just yet.

Since we discovered AT, I genuinely think things got worse. He became super obsessed about it, reading and watching everything, wearing the AP badge proud, embracing it fully (excuse my bitterness, i'm somewhat jelous, I think) and also, of course, learning everything he could about 'my type', too. And this triggered the hell out of me. He basically pulled all the general stuff, all the stereotypes on me, labelled me with sticky notes. I tried to tell him how this make me feel that it suffocates me. End result in a nutshell: a fight that I live in denial (no) and I think everything is fine with me (no, not the slightest), and that I dont even believe in AT (I do).

I also started reading about AT meanwhile. I felt and still feel devastated. I feel like there's no hope, I'm the worst human being, a piece of sh1t. And he did not fail to emphasize this too and I believe he tells the truth about how I make him feel. How I hurt him all the time. How much he suffers because of me. How I dont care about us at all. How I weaponize everything he says and use it against him. I know it's the anxious talking that I activated. And I'm not angry at him, I'm ashamed of myself. In the heat of the fight ofc I am angry (mostly directing it inside) I feel attacked. But when I calm down (usually a day or two) I can see what was ging on. Nevertheless this behaviour doesnt help me or him or us. Especially that he educated himself so much about it and still. I know it takes time, a lot of time and it wont change in a week - I feel like he expects change in an instant with this new information. I know my reactions are also very bad- either shutting down, going numb or attacking back, at an extreme lashing out. I love him very much, it's the the love and the ups and a tiny bit of hope that keeps me in the relationship. I want to be better I want to heal from this attachment of mine, I want to be secure as much as possible. With him. I had enough of the short term relationships that all endend the same way: me running away.

But all the negative info caused me to have very little trust in myself, to hate the way I am and I am sick of my attachment style, sick of myself, everything made me believe all I can do is ruin other people's lives. I know it is not my fault but my responsibility. It's hard. I try to force myself to talk to him about my feelings but I feel a physical block. I just cant say words. When I can he usually doesn't listen or say something that deactivates me completely and i shut down and retreat again - or very rarely lash out. I feel helpless, I feel sadness, emotional pain and anger. So much so I sometimes need to 'hurt' myself physically in the moment to distract my thoughts or to calm myself (skin scratching or just pushing my nails as deep into my fingertips as i can till it hurts more than the emotions, nothing serious) . I tried to do everything the opposite I'd normally do - i think you can figure yourself how did that go, it was 'sus'. Nothing I do seems to be good enough, everything I do is said to be for the wrong reason. All the 'forcing myself' take tremendous effort and energy and willpower and it is left unappreciated, unnoticed. I dont mean I need some well-done badge or pat pat on the head but more like patience and understanding. I go to therapy regurarly but I feel very alone. I feel unheard and that we dont understand eachother. He feels the same.  We are exhausted. But I do notice my and his behaviour pattern, I can identify what is happening. Only I dont have a working method to counter it when it happens. So I guess it's a start.

This sub helped me to realise I'm not completely mental and it's not wild when I get triggered about certain things. And that others feel or experience similar things as I do. I still have a lot to learn but I think the first step is that I need to accept it is part of me, understand why Im avoindant and stop hating myself for it. Then I can start the change, the healing process. You helped me a little in this first step.

Thank you again.

And sorry for the added little whining.

But once in a while, something will trigger me and I'll revert back to old habits. It's not a big deal if it's in a casual situation or with someone who doesn't know me well, but occasionally it'll happen with someone I'm quite close with and I can tell they notice something is off. In these cases, I sometimes struggle to decide whether or not I'd like to address it after the fact. I worry about it being cringe, or I think maybe I don't trust myself not to go overboard with an emotional explanation (or maybe I'm concerned that I'm just looking for validation that they're still there and it's the tiny bit of AP in my FA?)

684,"{FA} wondering if anyone has ever talked with your parent(s) about their contributions to your attachment style, and if so, did it help ?","Just some background for context: as of late I’ve really been digging into my attachment style and looking to address and heal parts of me. In doing so I’ve been thinking a lot about my upbringing, and talking a lot to my sister about our dad. I didn’t realize until my sister and I started talking more that I have very few fond memories of my time with him as a young child (I have vivid memories of how rough the teen years were). When my sister and I talked I really realized that when I look back the primary thing I associated with him is a fear of being criticized, shamed, rejected, and punished. I don’t know if I had blocked my early childhood relationship with him out, or just forgot, but in these talks with my sister a whole lot of memories came rushing back and few were good.

I’m not sure if my dad’s parenting is the cause of my attachment style or not, but I think it contributed to that and some other issues I’m working on. All this thinking about my childhood has made me consider talking to him about it, but I don’t really know if that would help. My dad and I have a pretty good relationship now, and he’s made a lot of positive changes over the past 20 years or so.  

So long story short, just looking for feedback on whether talking to him about this is worth pursuing, or perhaps likely to cause more harm than good.

685,"{FA} deactivating with everyone, why even bother","Hi folks!
This is a big rant 

Context : FA leaning DA,  half time dad of 3 kids

So I was quite proud of my progress in the past few months but in the last weeks, I noticed that I am increasingly shutting EVERYONE out : 
family, partner, friends, acquaintances, ex (shared custody of the kids), they all just annoy me, and push me into an uncaring ""limbo"" for different reasons:
 
- family and ex not respecting boundaries despite multiple clear warnings from me, gently at first, but losing patience
- promises not followed through.
- on the extremely rare occasion I do voice a need VERY clearly, it ends dismissed or not met, despite assurances
- friends disappearing because my separation stirs up their anxiety about their own issues 

I just cannot be bothered to even do the minimum of interactions, small talk or anything at this point, even with people I used to care about.
I tried to reach out to a lot of them in the past few months to no avail (I understand everyone is busy with their own stuff) , and now that some of them do, I honestly have nothing to say.

It boils down to this : I realized that I have to deal with everything on my own : close to no support at all, not organizational (a helping hand), financial, not emotional, nothing , to help deal with 3 small kids by myself (in my weeks with them), plus most of the financial burden, plus almost all of the kids having health issues, etc

And I am doing it so damn well and I am proud! 
I make my kids laugh every day, even when I am beyond exhausted, I try to be the best dad I can be, and juggle all the rest...

But it still hurts SO damn much... most likely resonates with and  enhances the abandonment core wound.

The only person trying to support me right now is my partner, but I do not want her to have to do that (unhealthy burden), so I feel like pushing her away as well, at least I won't have to deal with issues with the relationship...

In the end it just proves to me one more time that I can just manage really fine by myself, and mostly when it comes down to it there is no other way....

686,{DA} The struggles of a confused young man. (A bit of a rant),"Hello, people of r/AvoidantAttachment.

I write here to get some insight about my struggles and how they relate to the Attachment theory. Or maybe I just want to rant for a bit. Not sure how much you can help me, you are not therapists after all, but you probably know more than I. I don't intend to write my life's story here, just the main points, which hang over me constantly. Thank you in advance for your attention.

I learned about Attachment theory a few months ago, but didn't look into it much. I came back to it recently, and I found that I relate to much of what's written about it. I flaired myself as Dismissive Avoidant, but I'm not sure about the classification. I did the test, it came out as DA and I think it fits the best, from what I've read, but I can't be sure. And the reason is simple. Many of your posts here talk about relationships, mainly romantic ones. I have never been in such a relationship. I'm a 25-year-old male. From Poland, if that's helpful. My parents have been asking me for the past years (casually, not pestering), ""When will you get a girlfriend?"". What can I answer? ""I don't know. In the future. When I will find the right one."" etc. But here we come to, I think, the main problem.

Even though I consider myself attracted to the opposite sex, and I desire to be in a relationship and start a family, I just don't do anything towards it. I don't approach girls, I don't speak to them. This, however, is a part of the larger problem. I don't approach people in general. I was always like this, as far as I can remember. Well, not exactly. I generally don't have a problem with people talking to me. I was always happy to help someone at school, as I had good grades. I had friends at school, but no real friendships. No talking about the future or going somewhere together. Maybe just studying together, or playing games. I always disliked texting on the phone, so I wasn't in touch with anyone. The fact that I was living in a small village, far away from my school also didn't help. I was bullied, a bit in elementary school and more in middle. Not violent: name-calling, blocking my way or standing too close to me and saying stupid stuff. I rarely fought. I was mostly silent, I preferred to avoid those people and situations. I thought I was not clever enough to come up with an intelligent comeback to their words, so I just stayed silent. And this stayed with me, I think. That's what I do, avoid, run away, disengage. But I don't understand why.

I get it. Something is wrong with me. One way or another, I had it wired in my brain that I need to avoid dangerous situations. A defensive measure. Very good, avoid bullies and other dangerous people. Good. But it doesn't end with them. I, for some reason, can't talk to people. That's not true, I can, as any human can. But I feel as if I can't. I see a person. I have a thought, that I can ask that person something. ""Don't."" Immediately. It's not that clear, of course. Just a feeling. But it feels like a barrier, like a door in front of my face. I feel uncomfortable. Better just don't say anything. I feel better. But only for a moment as the next thing I feel is ""You failed. You know that you need to fight this stupid urge to avoid people, so why did you do it again?! How many more times will you do this?!"".

In the equivalent of college, I guess, there was a girl, that I think liked me. She would hug me on greetings. I felt super uncomfortable with it, but didn't say anything. We had a project to do together, so she invited me to her house. After we were done with it she wanted to take some pictures together with her phone. It, too, was uncomfortable. Eventually she stopped hugging me. Later changed schools and I haven't heard from her since. It strucked me just a few months ago, that maybe she felt something for me? Was I really so stupid to not see?

What do I want? Do I want to talk with people? Do I want to avoid people? Both at the same time? Who am I fighting, myself? If so, why can't I defeat myself? Or maybe, rather, what hope do I have of defeating myself? 

What a stupid defense is this one, that keeps me away from potential happiness? What do you fear, Akusativ? That you will be ridiculed? That people don't want to talk to you? That you are not interesting enough, or good-looking enough? Or maybe these are just excuses to mask the fact that I just don't want to talk? But I do? Then which is it? I don't know.

The events of this day inspired me to write this post. In the city where I live currently, there's a big festival of fantasy, board games, RPG's etc. All the things I love. Some people with cosplay too. I think to myself, perfect opportunity. I can go there and talk to people. Not much, just a bit. People playing the game I like. Maybe I can ask a few questions to a cosplayer who is dressed up as a character from my favorite game? After all, we have something in common. Great plan. But as soon as I go there, I feel, well, not overwhelmed, the crowd doesn't bother me. Can I even name the feeling? Just ""No"" and ""Don't"" and ""Don't even try"". So many people. Younger than me, my age, older than me. Just ""No"". People dressed up as characters I know. Surely they are used to fans of the show or the game striking a conversation with them, right? ""No, don't start"". Even people with ""free hugs"" signs, they wouldn't bat an eye, right? ""Don't even think about it"". Ok, fine, have it your way, I'm going home. ""Really, you failed again? You had a perfect opportunity and didn't use it?"" Just.... uggggg.....

What is this? This is not some creature inside my head, it's me. So why am ""I"" working against myself? Am I deceiving myself? Maybe I truly don't want to talk to people, just don't realize it. But I'm sitting here, writing this. Tomorrow is the last day of the festival. I want to try again, try to talk to people. Right, I want it now, but when I cross the gates, it will be all the same. But it is me. There's no one else. So why can't I just do what I want? Why is it so hard? And why does it feel like I'm fighting?

Maybe the problem is envy? I've been seeing a therapist for some time now, and she recently suggested, maybe I envy people who have what I don't have? That tracks to some extent. I had good grades, I was told I'm talented. I like helping people, but don't like asking for help. It's easy for me to see flaws in people. When I see a happy couple going down the street, I feel something. I didn't know what it was. Now I think it's resentment, just a tiny bit. They have something I don't. Sure, that makes sense. But the therapist suggested something deeper. Maybe I'm envious of another person just for the fact that they are a different person and therefore, by the fact of their very existence, they have and know something I don't have and don't know. (She didn't put it quite like this, the hyperbole is mine.) Now that's just crazy. Crazy. Not sure if it fits. Crazy. I look at a person and feel a strong desire to not engage them because it would mean I need something from them, and am therefore lesser than them? How would I even fight such an idea.

What stupid ideas sit in this stupid brain. If I could just hit myself in the head and ""fix"" everything inside, I would. I think too much. I overthink. Then how am I supposed to fix myself without thinking? What a weird world we live in.

I went down a spiral today thinking, I'm not ready for a relationship, I haven't fully finished my single life (I'm not even a very sexually active person lol) 

I did some meditation affirmations and one of them was
""Learn to trust your intuition"" so I leant into it and my body said... you're not ready yet... then a bunch of fear about letting her down and of how I'll feel about her once I've cut things off. 

I haven't been in a relationship in years and I think it would be worth a try, but I don't want to lead anyone on. She's so great I feel like I would be a dummy not to give it my best shot

691,Is the main difference between {DA} and {FA} the fear that leads to deactivation?,"First of all, let me say I am SO grateful that I found this community! As an introvert who fearfully avoided her way out of a lot of friendships, having other people to discuss this stuff with during a hard time has been a lifesaver! Anyhoo. As someone who identifies as an FA who was previously leaning Secure after years of hard work, I can see the similarities between FA and DA in terms of the fear of rejection, loss of freedom and deactivating, but as someone who's always been extremely sensitive and was AP most of my adolescent life, I really can't identify with the Dismissive side of deactivation. In essence, I may not know that it's related to my AT at the time, but (after a buttload of therapy) I can now pretty much always sense the anxiety that leads to me deactivating. In terms of relationships, if I start to get the ""ick"" about someone/a relationship whom I'm otherwise very happy with, it's accompanied by a ton of very obvious anxiety, which has lead me to see that I was deactivating and regulate myself and the ick goes away. Do DA's just go along naively thinking that it is what it is, there was ""no spark"", or their intuition agreed there wasn't ""more"", they felt ""blah"", etc? Basically, is it always a **lack** of feeling that ""confirms"" they shouldn't be with someone/in a situation when they process it in hindsight? Do DAs have the anxiety that they interpret as their instinct as well, or is that the main difference between the Dismissive and Fearful attachments?

692,DAE notice that a lot of today's music promotes insecure attachments? {da} {fa} {sa},"...and that many of the lyrics do so in sexist ways?

Turned the radio to a ""Top 10"" station today (usually not my go-to but I had a teen in the car lol)...and is it just me - or do the lyrics mostly sound like different versions of the same broken record?

From the female singers: I desperately need you / I love you more than I love myself / you've moved on and you're fine while I'm a mess / fuck the other girls because its a competition

From the male side: players gonna play / you won't quit chasing me / I'm confused / not ready to commit / I cheated, now sorry, take me back

Not saying that its always along these lines, but it was repetitive enough on each side of the gender spectrum to be obvious to me... Leads me to think, no wonder there are so many people with issues! This is what the majority of young people sing along to on a daily basis? Yiikes. 

Olivia Rodrigo's top songs are all about pining away for a guy who's already moved on - got FA written all over it. The Weeknd keeps being the most DA person I've heard of lol, he's apparently so completely emotionally unavailable. In all seriousness, the music industry should be ashamed of the messages that it perpetuates. 

As a woman, many of these songs don't empower me - and as a mom, I don't want my boys to subconsciously start thinking that relationships are traps, etc.

I've heard from single friends, both men & women, that the dating world is a mess. The music industry seems to *want* it that way. I hate to be so cynical, but just why are most of the top songs so dysfunctional..? Anyone agree?

693,{FA} Keeping Promises… to Myself.,"I have been reading a lot of the FA and DA subs lately and first want to say thanks to everyone who engages here. It's really been helpful and I feel like there are people who truly get how difficult it can be regularly being dysregulated. Hope everyone is having a good day.

I very, very recently cut things off with a suspected DA who I was in a situationship with for sometime. We dated for a while, back in the day and reconnected about 7 months ago. In classic FA form, because he was more avoidant, I was very anxious and self abandoned all the time, allowing my expectations to be managed down so that we could stay connected (I consider myself an FA because I leaned *very, very* heavily DA in the last serious relationship I was in. We ended up having a kid together and then broke up. Luckily we have been able to work to repair our friendship but I know that my avoidance hurt him deeply). I lean a lot more secure these days and was able to kindly let situationship guy know that I am looking for commitment and that I know he doesn't want that with me. As much as I could complain that he couldn't give me what I wanted, I realized that I also could not give him what he was looking for. He said that it made sense and I wished him well. I'm doing pretty well with it mainly because I know we just don't want the same thing.

In reflecting on everything, I noticed something. Part of my issue was last-minute planning and then not following thru, just for him to start up a conversation again the next day and not acknowledge it (I understand that isn't a DA trait per se; more immaturity on his part, imo). It made me so, so angry. How can I trust a person who doesn't do what they say? Why is he wasting my time? **HOW DARE HE?** While it’s understandably upsetting, and I didn’t deserve that, I judged him so, so hard and was super rude to him in my mind. But you know what? I break promises that I make to myself all the fucking time! I say I will start working out, I don't. I say I'll go to bed at 10:30 so I can get a good night's sleep, I don't. I say I will stop hanging out with people when I don't really want to or quit my side hustle job because it's too much work given that I have a 9-5 and am a single parent. Guess what- **I DON'T!** All in all, I said I wanted commitment with this person about a million times but still stayed when he couldn't give me a clear answer. That was a broken promise, too, and yet, I thought I was somehow better than him at the same time (again, avoidance lol). I shamed him for something that I also do. And I am ready to take accountability for that.

I used to be one of the people desperate for some kind of step-by-step guide on how to ""do the work"" to become more secure. I'm no therapist or expert but I now realize that 1) healing work and becoming secure can look very different for everyone, even if they have the same AT and 2) for me, my work is now to look at myself and do my best to keep the promises that I make to myself, no matter how tiny or seemingly inconsequential they might seem. The more I can do what I say I am going to do and stick with it, the more I can trust myself to make the decisions that work best for me. I also need to not shame myself when I fall a little bit short- sometimes you get caught up scrolling through Reddit for hours and it's suddenly midnight lol. I don't plan to be too hard or rigid with myself, that would be counterproductive. But I think this is a very active part of “the work” that will keep me on my path to security. Not advice for anyone else by any means, I just wanted to share and contribute something to a community that has done so much for me. :)

**TL/DR: After ending a situationship, I now realize that part of “doing the work” to keep on the path to being more secure is to try my absolute best to acknowledge and keep the promises I make to myself, no matter how small, and not beat myself up if I fall short sometimes. That way, I can trust myself and the people around me and not judge them so harshly when they fall short.**",ujxa8m,20,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ujxa8m/fa_keeping_promises_to_myself/,AvoidantAttachment,0

696,Sex and deactivation {fa} {da},"Does anyone else start to deactivate after the first time having sex with someone, every time? The next day, the fault-finding starts like clockwork - but usually not complete ick, just that my distancing strategies start to kick in. Unlike your stereotypical woman, I start to detach after sex rather than attach. It makes me feel weird tbh to be a warm and friendly woman with this issue. 

I've never not experienced this, I guess it's part of why my relationships don't last long. I always lose almost all attraction after a few months max, and feel almost no pleasure or emotional connection during sex after a few weeks or months with the same partner. 

I've felt most attached to partners where I didn't get to have sex with them for a while. If I have sex with a partner on a second date it's hard for me to stay interested for long, no matter how good our connection is. I can have butterflies on a date, have sex and still fault find the next day.

I have this hypothesis that dismissive avoidants (like myself) do not feel attracted to securely attached people in a lasting way.

698,{da} I don’t want to repeat history,"I just found this sub, and I’m glad I did. I’ve known for a long time that I stray from emotional intimacy because of how I grew up and I’ve always been a very analytical person. I live in my head. I haven’t realized until recently how much my attachment style has affected my relationships. 

I dated this girl for almost 2 years, we were each other’s first love. I broke up with her three times. It wasn’t always the healthiest relationship, but we loved each other. I knew I had issues communicating my feelings and even understanding them. I couldn’t trust my own thoughts, especially when they would race and going a million miles an hour. I know I hurt her, and that kills me. She has an anxious attachment style, and we couldn’t figure out how to support each other. 

Now, I’m in a loving relationship with a girl who treats me so well. Better than anyone I’ve ever met. And yesterday I almost repeated history. I told her that it feels like she’s more into this than I am. She took it as she loves me more than I love her. Immediately my thoughts race, and I think I’m probably better off alone. It’s probably best if we break up. Luckily, we had a long conversation and were able to talk through it. I told her I felt broken, and never want to hurt her, but here I am. 

Frankly, I’m just exhausted with myself. My brain, my impulsivity, my racing thoughts. I want to change. Recently I also haven’t been able to stop romanticizing my ex in my head. The thoughts won’t go away. And I felt terrible for ever hurting her and handling my emotions the way I did. I just feel like such a mess.

699,"{fa} aging parents, illness, and massive guilt.","I see alot of posts regarding romantic interests and even friends, but the ground zero of this whole thing is usually our parents. 

I wonder if we don't talk about it much because we would rather avoid it...

I have always had a very tense and tumultuous relationship with my parents, there have been times where I have felt like I flat out hated them, and then felt massive amounts of guilt about how I felt. 

They have always been there for me, they love me, so why do I feel such intolerable irritation around them, like I just can't get away fast enough?

I feel like a terrible daughter.

So here we are, my mother now has stage four cancer, she has been going to chemo, her hair has been falling out.

She wants me to be there for her, to reach out, she wants to feel my love and support.

And I just can't.

It's so hard to explain. 

I care, I really really do, but my brain just won't let me go there. It takes so much for me to even message her telling her I love her. 

I feel massively selfish, like it's a cop-out to attribute my avoidance of seeing her to my attachment style.

Obviously nobody wants to have to deal with this, it's not like people enjoy seeing others sick, but they show up anyway because they love them.

I was the only person in my family who didn't go see my grandad in the hospital before he died too.

I suspect I know why I have such a hard time showing i care, but it doesn't make me feel like any less of a monster.

701,Sibling Relationships,"**There's a TLDR at the end of this behemoth.**

There's so little available popular psychological content/media on sibling relationships, but I have been really looking at mine a lot lately, and making some breakthroughs with my older sister. I thought I'd talk about my experiences here, as well as see if anyone has any thoughts on attachment re:siblings, or any books/etc. that are useful on this topic.

Since I never really formed a solid attachment with either parent, I feel like my sister almost became my primary attachment figure (at least, until I started having boyfriends.) In hindsight of course, this wasn't fair to her, as she was just a child. Both she and I got parentified a lot by our mother, but especially her—and doubly so with me essentially treating her as my parent.

We were always really really close growing up. Not a lot of fights, and when we did have them they were really short-lived. I feel like we kind of *survived* the emotionally \[alternatingly\] tumultuous/empty household together. I have vivid memories of us strategizing how to handle my mom coming home/needing to be in the car with her/etc. so that we could have as few interactions with her as possible (or none if we could swing it.) We had so much fun together and really got each other.

But lately I feel like my rose-colored glasses about her have been kind of coming off. I also remember her criticizing me a lot and putting me down. I remember passing her in the hallway and her yelling ""MOVE!"" when I didn't just leap out of her way automatically. Everyone tip-toed around her and she was just really, really irritable and cranky all the time. She told me I was annoying and compared me to all her friend's siblings, who were much more calm and didn't bug her as much.

Just regular sibling stuff, to an extent, sure. We all give each other hard times and learn socialization through each other kind of clumsily, right?

But it's continued into adulthood. I've realized that I come to her a lot for input, tell her a lot about my life and inner world—and she doesn't reciprocate very much. Doesn't let me in. Very guarded. Most of the time she has her arms folded, eyebrows raised in judgement when I'm speaking. She'll sometimes give me a lot of insight and actually talk through things with me, but it's usually in kind of an exasperated way with an irritated tone. Sometimes she'll ask me questions and I'll answer them in-depth, but her response will be like ""well, I don't know what to tell ya. Good luck with that and hope it works out,"" with zero emotion. Conversation ender. I never registered how much these things really hurt until recently.

Like I say, I recognize my part in it: that I probably have leaned too heavily on her since childhood, and that's not fair to her, but it also comes from my own low confidence. I always viewed her as so wise, so put-together—and myself as the broken ""mess."" My whole family kind of reinforced this narrative. But now I'm seeing that I actually have a lot going for me that she doesn't. I'm seeing how much she's always hidden away alone in her LTR-turned-marriage, how isolated and alone she is in it and doesn't let anyone else in, how incredibly emotionally (and materially) dependent she is on her partner (she's never filed her own taxes, for example) and how she's never actually been on her own/independent or done much for herself. If her partner doesn't do it for her—every slight inconvenience from ordering the pizza to fixing the car—then she has my mom do it. My mom still cleans her house and makes her doctor appointments.

She lived with our mom until she was 23, moved in with her now-husband while in grad school, then the *two* of them came back and lived with my mom for three more years! That's unthinkable to me, as I went the opposite route of moving out at 18 and never looking back—and not allowing my mom to help me financially/materially in any way through adulthood (lately working on coming into better balance with this.) Then they moved into the place that they're still in to this day, ten years later. She's never lived on her own or with roommates—from mom's to her husband's. I never saw this reality until recently.

Even the way she's handled her career is a bit in fantasy-land... she wants to be a published author (and she actually works very hard on this craft) but doesn't actually share her work anywhere or put herself out there. Meanwhile I've been a working artist for years with a rich, evolving, growing work life. I've lived with roommates as well as alone for years, done a ton of solo travel (of which she's done zero), handled all of the logistics of my own life...(yes, kind of to a fault/too far the other way and I'm working on that too.)

There's nothing *wrong* with any of this—I'm not trying to put her down. The reason I say all of this is because I'm seeing how reality is so incredibly in contrast to how I've viewed her and how she portrays herself (as a fiercely independent and worldly creative professional—for real), and therefore what my own role has been in our relationship.

So lately I've been working on a few things personally:

* Just tryin to energetically hold my head up high around her, like I have value both in myself and that she could actually benefit from
* Owning that I'm actually pretty wise, experienced, worldly, independent, and creative myself—arguably to much higher degrees honestly
* Standing up to her in small ways when she starts being judgmental, irritable, or cruel
* Asking what's going on in her life a little more directly, to highlight how unwilling she actually is to say anything (I used to never ask, just quietly wanted her to be forthcoming.)
* Using more discernment in how much I disclose, how long I'll ""vent"" and about what, and generally trying not to ask her advice. When I tell her decisions I'm making or ways I'm approaching things and she acts like it's ""wrong""/gets that judgement look/sighs heavily and rolls her eyes/or interjects with her own opinions— instead of defending, resisting, or just accepting that she's probably right, I'm thanking her for her opinion and asserting in a calm/simple way that I feel good about my choices and moving on.

The good news is that she's really, really, really receptive to all of these things. They instantly highlight how shitty she's being basically, and she's a really good person, so I think she immediately feels appropriate shame for her behavior and is starting to treat me better.

We also had a direct convo a few months ago wherein I asked why it is she doesn't share things with me, and expressed wanting to hear more from her. She got really defensive (she's the most defensive person I've ever known), but then told me about a few times when I'd really failed to show up/hurt her feelings, and cried. I was able to apologize for those things, and I think it really helped both of us.

There's another chapter to this saga too, recently over the holidays. TBH I was completely falling apart, at the climax of a sort of long depressive episode surrounding extreme relationship distress, during which I'd become suicidal a couple of times and she was understandably very worried. I didn't tell my parents about these feelings (can't do that with them for varying reasons), so she was also probably a little over-burdened being the only family member to know (I did have friend and therapist support too.)

In a really low moment, I told her flat-out that I needed her to make some time for me that day because it was essentially an emergency. And it was.  I asked her directly to please come to my house because she never does (no one in my family ever does), and I'm always going to her, and I need just once for someone to come meet me where I am. It's really hard for me to ask for help in this way, but I'm learning to do it more when I'm really in need. She actually showed up, which is meaningful because I've directly asked her a few times in the past and she says no (including asking her to come to the hospital when I needed an ultrasound to find out if I had cancer.) 

I was so, so tender—in need of warmth and love and compassion (which I've realized more and more the last year I've had almost none of in my life.) She showed up as usual—hard, cold, arms folded, eyebrows raised, speaking in short mildly irritated bursts. Finally I asked very calmly if it's hard for her to show warmth to me. She got very defensive (of course), saying, ""I *knew* if I came over here that I'd be 'doing it wrong'! I'm stressed too! I'm doing my best!"" Normally I'd back down when she snaps at me like this, assuming that I was actually horrible for even asking, but I stayed open and vulnerable (a skill I'm learning), and soothed myself that I didn't do anything wrong. I said I appreciated so much that she came to me and was really finding her company helpful, just being listened to and not alone, and thanked her sincerely. I told her that it wasn't my intention to make her feel like she was doing it wrong, but that I'm sorry that my question had that impact. I told her that I just noticed that she doesn't hug or touch me, seems irritated, and told her how badly I just needed to feel like someone who loves and knows me actually wants to be around me. This melted her.

After that I came to stay with her and her family for four days—totally unheard of. I've never stayed with her once. I never ""don't want to be alone"" for prolonged periods like that. They didn't want me to be alone in my state either. We really re-bonded during that time. We started hugging. She even spooned me on the couch while we watched TV—something that hasn't happened since we were small children. At one point she cried, saying that our mom had observed that she stopped hugging people after she was sexually abused as a teen. Things got so open and tender. Even her husband and I re-bonded (we drifted leading up to/after his last relapse.) 

Things are continuing in this direction. She texts me to check in with a warm tone, says ""I love you,"" invites me to things, and suggests doing things that are more aligned with my world too, like hiking together. It feels like something really, really, really long-lost is being recovered and healed. I can't tell you how incredible it is. I'm crying typing all of this. She's always defaulted into the ""most important person"" slot in my life. *And it feels, for the first time, like I might actually be able to do some work on a relationship with a member of my family of origin and have it be effectual—*like, we actually have a better relationship as a result. I've done a ton of work with both parents to absolutely no avail whatsoever, so this is unexpected the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.

In regards to attachment: it's like holy shit my sister is avoidant as fuck. I didn't even realize it. And in our relationship, I can be more on the anxious side. But I really am both with her, swinging wildly as well as just avoidant in some ways, anxious in others (my mom is extremely disorganized, my dad firmly DA.)

I'm looking forward to continuing this journey, and especially to untangling how this relates to my own attachment stuff. If anyone can see any more patterns here I'm open to insight/observation.

# TLDR:

My sister and I have always been incredibly close, but lately I'm seeing a lot of the unhealthy patterns in our relationship past and present. I've been making personal changes and we've had some good conversations that are starting to right this ship, and it's amazingly healing. There's probably a lot behind my attachment patterning in this relationship that I'm still sorting out, and I'm curious how others think about siblings re:attachment and if anyone has any good resources on this.",s4s8l6,20,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s4s8l6/sibling_relationships/,AvoidantAttachment,0
702,Updated Sub Rules,"Hello,

An adjustment to the sub rules has been made in order to keep things on topic and facilitate a space that puts avoidants first:

&#x200B;

* AP users are restricted to participating only in the 'Monthly Relationship Discussion: Ask Avoidants' thread and mod posts. This includes commenting.

&#x200B;

We've noticed a lot of fearful avoidants who appear to lean anxious (regardless of flair) who participate.

**If you are fearful avoidant and are leaning anxious, this is not the sub for you to be in at that time. If you are leaning avoidant, this is the right place for you.**

We've had to ban and call out quite a few users at this point for flair fraud mainly involving avoidant and secure flair.

We love our visitors and all of the contributions that have been made but the priority is to protect the integrity of this sub. Avoidants pursuing therapy or not are welcome here. There is zero tolerance for any abusive or negative behavior towards our avoidant users and the attachment style as a whole.",rg7yx1,20,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rg7yx1/updated_sub_rules/,AvoidantAttachment,0
703,Just some thoughts,"I'm having a bad week and being on the attachment subs is giving me a place to aim my frustration. I just wanted to rant/vent about a few things. 

1. There is something very gross to me about labeling a partner with a DA attachment style. Any attachment style, but for some reason the DA one annoys me the most. Especially since it's typically in regards to a very short term relationship and there's next to no way you can actually know someone's attachment style in a few months. I've known my boyfriend for 6 years, dating for 1, and I still have no flipping clue if he's straight DA or FA leaning DA - so I just call him avoidant. 
2. Just because your partner takes some space or doesn't answer back right away doesn't mean they're a DA or avoidant. Maybe they're tired. Maybe they had a rough day. Maybe they're sick. 
3. People are individuals and the bad behavior of one DA or FA or AP that you know doesn't mean all people with that attachment style are the same. Stop generalizing people based on your bad experiences. 
4. Relationships only work if both parties are giving. Both parties have to put in some effort to communicate effectively and have healthy boundaries. And I can pretty much guarantee if you say you have communicated to your partner and they chose to ignore you, you didn't do it effectively. There's a different between demanding/whining and *communicating.* Asking your partner ""Why can't you just show up for me?"" is not the same as ""I feel disconnected from you when you take space. Is there a way I can honor that need for you, and you would be willing to honor my need for connection?"" 
5. **It is not healthy or normal to require constant communication or presence from your partner. And no matter how many times APs advocate that this is a valid need, it is** ***not.*** 
6. What if.... and I know this is a radical idea... but what if we just accepted people as they are and stopped trying to change them?

704,Am I gonna be alone forever?,"I've been pretty happy with how I handle all of my interactions. Honestly think I've been behaving quite securely and I'm feeling all of my feelings.

But I'm just going through one of those times in which I'm seriously wondering if I'm gonna be alone forever.

I've said in the past that I don't experience loneliness. I've mentioned recently that I think it's gonna happen soon. I think we've arrived lol.

I do everything alone and seldom share my experiences with others. I was thinking, ""does food taste better if I share it with someone else?"". Or, ""would going to the beach at night with someone else be more exciting?"".

I noticed how capable of a person I am just to service my self-reliance. I have reached out for help a few times recently and that was nice. But maybe I need someone I can *really rely on* to reap full benefits.

That's tough though because it means I have to really connect with someone and become close to them. It pains me to say that I'm not the type of person who connects easily at all. I wish it were different.

705,Codependent vs Healthy Love,"I just want to draw attention to how closely related insecure attachment and codependency are. I think this is a topic that isn't talked about as much, and sometimes hard to even recognize. Codependency has such a negative stigma, frequently associated with substance abuse. But it goes beyond that. I really like this graphic to compare a codependent vs healthy love. I look at the codependent side and see my past relationships, and I look at the healthy love side and see my current relationship. It's a testament to my growth, and hopefully it helps someone else.

706,"DA in an awkward stage of healing, seeking advice","TL;DR I'm a DA pretty deep into healing, struggling with the discovery of a huge amount of my unmet need and a sense of futility in ever getting those needs met.

I'm DA who has been working really hard in therapy for 2.5 years now. When I started out I had no awareness that I had unmet needs, I had no connection to my emotions, and no deep connections to any people in my life at all. I was pretty numbed out from everything and closed-off.

I've spent the last 2.5 years peeling back the layers of defenses, the walls, the avoidance. What I found underneath those layers, was a huge pit of unmet need. I believe that as a young baby, I wasn't getting the care and attention that I needed from my parents, and so I tried to convince myself that I didn't need care and attention at all. I covered that up with a thick layer of shame and a shit ton of avoidance and frankly those defenses were really effective! I lived almost 30 years of my life completely unaware of any of this, until I stumbled into a therapy office (for unrelated things!) and was very surprised to uncover an entire lifetime of emotional avoidance. I ""took the red pill"" to look inside and see the truth, and and I've been doing this difficult work ever since. I've done a lot of work and I'm really proud. Most importantly, I've grown a big well of self-love and self-compassion, which feels novel and profound.

But I keep circling back on the same thing. Which is, I feel like my need for love and connection now, is as deep as the Grand Canyon. It feels utterly impossible that I would ever be able to meet the amount of need that I have for love and connection. My level of need feels trapped at the stage of a little child (think like a baby or toddler crying out for its mom - that baby has a basically endless need for the mom's care, and can't be reasoned with). Meeting a friend for coffee or going to an hour of therapy per week feels like trying to fill the Grand Canyon with a garden hose.

My intuition tells me that way forward is, (1) Grieving the reality that I didn't get enough of that as a child and that kind of love is unavailable as an adult (I haven't felt any sadness or grief about this yet), and (2) Continuing to grow self-love, and (3) Continuing to seek love and connection from friends and my partner, in an adult way, and letting that fill the cup.

But I'm having trouble with all three of these. I can't seem to tap into grief. And my own self-love feels far from being enough. And I have such a deep sense of futility, of feeling like the love/connection I'm finding is not the type I need. Literally just picture yourself standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon holding a garden hose, wondering how long it'll take to fill. That's how I feel. It's hard to keep going, hoping somehow this will work. I *know* this is one of my core wounds - a belief that no matter what I do, I will never feel truly loved. But fuck if it doesn't feel 110% true and real and impossible to get around. 

I would love to hear from any other DAs who have experienced anything similar (or from anybody, who has dealt with that ""never enough"" feeling).",q8heoj,21,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/q8heoj/da_in_an_awkward_stage_of_healing_seeking_advice/,AvoidantAttachment,0

708,"Behaving secure, still avoidant","I hear the advice often to keep doing the secure things and eventually it becomes natural.

I just want to call out that for me, while behaving securely (in well practiced scenarios) does start to become natural, I haven't found that it changed my internal thought-process much (yet at least).

I have to put a lot of energy to identify love languages, think of appropriate responses, remember to make people feel ""seen"", etc. I constantly get the urge to share less after sharing vulnerable things (but I still regularly do it!). I don't get the feeling of ""needing"" these relationships and am ok to not have them (and definitely maintained that mentality during fallouts). Its probably avoidant mentality because these people support me and enrich my life-why wouldn't I want to *need* them?

Side note, I just realized that a lot of my closest friends are self-aware AP's working towards secure. Hats off to the secure anxious-leaning folks, you guys really know how to make people feel loved and seen, man.

Anyway, been practicing secure for at least 3 years in family/friendships and I've changed a lot during that time so my journey is far from over.

709,{FA} Is explaining avoidance to people (other than partners) worth it?,"I feel like for the most part I’ve selected people in my adult life who “get it.” I don’t really have relationships with AP people for my own sanity. Someone freaks out about not getting texted back right away it’s like congrats now I’m gonna text you never. Most of my friends understand that someone taking a while to get back to you is a sign that they’re overwhelmed or busy or something, not a personal insult. Or they’ll at least be like “hey is something going on?” instead of immediately taking it personally and attacking me. I think as a generation younher people have more of an understanding of this in general.


And of course anyone who is in an intimate relationship with me is gonna know all about it. We’ll have an ongoing conversation about how I have a PTSD diagnosis, need to be handled a certain way, need to go slow, etc. 



However, I have some family and people I actually care about, usually older folks, who do display these kinds of behaviors and I still want a relationship with them. They don’t know these things about me and it’s like they have no theory of mind for being too overwhelmed to respond. I feel like a lot of old people have some generational differences too where they have never had the experience of being burnt out by constant phonecalls and texts. For example I have an 85 year old family friend who calls me on holidays and if I don’t get back to her same day she’ll then call my mom in tears, worried that I hate her, and it just adds pressure and makes it even harder to call her back. 



Is it worth trying to explain my reaction to people like this? Will it just come across as self-indulgent? Have people had success with this?",13n6y47,20,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/13n6y47/fa_is_explaining_avoidance_to_people_other_than/,AvoidantAttachment,0

712,I feel like an emotional leech {fa},"I feel like I’m constantly just using people for emotional validation. I’m almost certainly FA. I have ADHD. I’m pretty sure I have rOCD. 

My partner has been wonderful so far. We’ve only been dating a month and a half (as my other post said you’ve probably seen). She’s receptive, kind, caring, funny, we get a long well, we have similar hobbies. I enjoy seeing her. And yet when I’m not with her, I doubt it all. I feel like I’m faking my attachment to her. “Am I settling? Does she just *seem* right but she’s not? Do I *really* enjoy my time spent with her?” 

My dad cheated on my mother and stepmother and it’s put permanent fear that I will be like that. I am so ungodly terrified I will do the same. I see an attractive woman and I start thinking if being with them would be better than my current partner. Things aren’t working, blah blah blah. So then I go to my cousin (emotional confidant) and tell him all this shit. I’m scared I will cheat. I’ve never had anything other than casual sex. I break it off early blah blah blah. Talk about my dad cheating. Like all this is just to gain fucking brownie points to setup me cheating and then him not feeling so bad because I forewarned him I feel guilty I’d do it. It’s so frustrating. I don’t know what I’d do with myself if I cheated on my partner. To cause that pain? To cause that break in trust? That hurt to someone who loves you? How could I ever do that? Even his post feels like me trying to get positive feedback and reassurance that I’m not an awful person. And then he says I don’t seem like I would cheat or he knows I wouldn’t cheat because I told all these things. That’s the fucking point! You don’t know that. You. Don’t. Know. That. For all I know, I’m manipulating your fucking ass to make you think that’s the way I feel! 

It all feels like I’m just a leech trying to get validation from everyone. Like I *really, truly* feel these things deep down. Like there’s some sick fuck part of me that *wants* to cheat and I’m just using you to make me come off as a better person so I can give you puppy dog eyes after I do it and get off easy. Using this attachment shit as a cover/defense for the real me. It’s so exhausting and I just want to cry. I just want to be secure with my partner. I don’t want to question if she’s the one, I don’t and shouldn’t fucking know that! We haven’t dated two months, I shouldn’t know that yet. And yet I’m so worried that she’s going to turn out bitchy or use my vulnerabilities  against me in fights or fucking what *I don’t know*. I’m so sick of it all. Being alive feels exhausting right now. 

She deserves better than this trauma bullshit. She doesn’t deserve my in and out push and pull emotional leech game. She hasn’t seen it yet but I know she will soon. 

All this shows I’m just an awful person. I’m beyond a narcissist clearly. I’m sorry guys. Therapy can’t fix this shit and it’s a far cry of a fucking joke to even think that. I’m not even a broken person, I’m just a shitty person. It felt good to get this in writing and damn it I just want to be crucified by a neutral party already. Just affirm all these feelings of shittiness. I just feel like such a fraud trying to gain sympathy.

713,I would be even more avoidant if it weren't for... {FA},"I recently reconnected with someone from high school very briefly. It got me thinking a lot about the period in my life where we interacted. I was in high school, and struggling. My mom got remarried and moved to another state, so I moved in with my dad. My dad is the most DA person I've ever met, and it was really hard to be there as a teenager. 

I met my now ex boyfriend and biological father of my oldest son at my first job. I was 16, he was 21. I can't even begin to tell you why I was attracted to him, because looking back now he was a walking red flag. Oh, right, attachment issues. He already had an extensive criminal history which included going AWOL from the army and evading police. He was an alcoholic who also dabbled in recreational drugs. We started dating and he was abusive. Mainly psychologically but physically as well. 

Eventually I ended up living with him and his mom as a teenager. I know this to be one of my mom's biggest regrets - agreeing to this situation. My home life was chaotic and abusive. I was deep into my self harm and attempted suicide at one point. I remember many times falling asleep during class because I had been up all night fighting with my boyfriend and then crying myself to sleep. 

Anyway, this friend from high school was a boy. There was mutual attraction, but obviously my home life was complicated. The abuse came to a head when my then boyfriend found out I was going to prom with this other boy. Then boyfriend was too old to attend, so couldn't come even if I wanted him to - which I didn't. 

I don't really know how it happened, but the boy from high school talked to his grandma about my situation. It was a small town - boy's mom worked with boyfriend's mom and had even further insight into the situation. His grandma was a foster parent who ran a daycare. And for whatever reason, she offered to take me in. I don't think she asked for anything in return. All I remember is going to meet her the day after prom and living with her from then on. 

This woman who knew nothing about me except that I was in an abusive situation opened her door to me. She got nothing in return. And I did cause her problems too. I remember taking a bunch of Klonipin and cutting my arm up while there, and her taking my pills from me the next day. The boyfriend, after trying to break up with him, came into the house uninvited with a knife to his chest and the cops had to be called. It wasn't easy. 

But this stranger took me in. She took care of me. Fed me. Gave me a place to sleep. Included me as if I was her own family. She even came to my wedding to another man years later. 

Looking back on the situation I realize now how important that was for me. Even if I didn't know it then, her taking me in was a huge stepping stone in me being able to eventually leave the abusive situation. It was an act that showed me I was worthy of being loved just for existing. Without that, I think I would be in a totally different place than I am now. I might even be dead. 

It got me thinking, do you have a similar story? We often talk about how our parents/caregivers caused our avoidance, but what about the people who helped lessen it? Is there someone who played a small part in your life that looking back had a big impact on preventing you from being even more avoidant?",wpvz1w,21,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wpvz1w/i_would_be_even_more_avoidant_if_it_werent_for_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
714,{da} I have isolated myself and I'm having trouble pushing back,"I live in Edinburgh, Scotland. I'm a man in his mid thirties. I'm a DA, and I've had several years of therapy by this point. I've never been friends with more than a few people at a time, and I've only had one relationship, which she initiated and then ended some years afterward because I started asking for my needs to be met rather than hiding them from her. Therapy has reached the point where I simply need to have a deeply emotionally intimate relationship. I need to have the experience of being  deeply vulnerable and having people (that I am not paying) help me, rather than leaving. But these experiences are incredibly difficult to obtain. I can do no more work alone. My work now is exclusively to be done with or indirectly for others.

Until April this year, I had a pretty active social life made up of dance classes and various events arranged through a local discord server. The people there are younger and much more social than me. They're tolerant of me, but in the group setting I wasn't able to become vulnerable enough to build any deep connections. Going out felt neutral, like an easy chore. I dated for a bit (via online dating exclusively) but found no-one, and had experiences that only reinforced my core wound: ""No-one will ever like the real me"". I changed jobs in April, fleeing incompetent leadership and a bad working culture. However, I *also* changed Industries and took a 25% pay cut at the same time. My new employer is better in essentially every way other than the pay.

However, I now work for a company with less than 10 staff, with a competent boss and a straightforward mission. There is an *incredible* temptation to become a workaholic. Why bother leaving the office if it's the only place that has a use for me, the only place I feel competent and worthwhile? Further, the work I had to do to establish some basic working standards immediately after I joined caused me to drop all of my social activities. Shortly before I changed jobs I dropped all partner dancing because (I learned) the skill required to be an effective social dancer takes years to develop, and I couldn't take everyone expecting me to already have it due to my age. Then summer came and removed my other dance lessons (they're pinned to the school terms).

I'm now taking my first annual leave period, in the middle of a massive comedy festival in my hometown. I ""should"" be out going to shows with friends, but instead I'm scared of my phone to the point where I've let its battery die twice, and I spend all of my time either playing Rimworld, completing various chores, watching youtube or listening to podcasts while walking about. Or on Reddit, obviously.

Part of it is that I get the feeling that if I disappear from a social scene, or forget to reply to a friend's message one too many times, I'll be treated with suspicion when I try to reconnect. I feel that relationships are a bit like pulling the pin out of a grenade - any inconsistency in the way you interact with them after you start them is punished severely. I have a variety of other negative beliefs about relationships which I won't bore you with because we made the label ""DA"" to summarise them.

I don't know where to go from here. I can probably just about afford a fortnightly therapist until the next fuel price hike, but after that I simply won't have the money for it. How do I break out? How do I move beyond an endless cycle of distracting myself from the fear of having nothing to talk about, or being judged for not already having 5-10 years experience in anything I want to try (apart from my job)? How can I move past the sense that anything less than perfectly socially adjusted is unacceptable? Can this subreddit help? Or is this something I've just accidentally journaled in the wrong place? Hopefully I can at least bring myself to read the replies.",wkgf96,20,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wkgf96/da_i_have_isolated_myself_and_im_having_trouble/,AvoidantAttachment,0

716,{DA} break up & repair. Any perspective?,"I thought I was a fearful avoidant but I never looked into or tried to circumvent my habits. I knew I had problems with fawning & boundaries but I never knew where to start. I had no idea it had to start within myself in the form of attachments.

I broke up, over reasons I thought were completely... reasonable. And I realized I made a mistake. I came crawling back, but after a rejection, my mind snapped (""denial of loss"") and I shotgun blasted therapy emails and, was emailed by my old therapist, [freetoattach.com](https://freetoattach.com)... which. Is my extended autobiography, to a T. All except the affairs part.

It taught me how to unrepress, deal with guilt, navigate boundaries, face criticism and being wrong without spiraling into shame, and just about everything I need to tackle this and overcome my avoidant nature to return to a ""secure"" state. To completely change my habits. It's a day by day process and a constant, present battle (I want to dissociate and ""wait"" to deal but I literally can't with this condition.) I'm trying to repair my relationship right now... but there is zero emotional intimacy. We still say we love each other every day, but this space is causing me so much anxiety (and it's ironic, logically we WANT space... but this time I'm trying to fight it. How can I fight it if I can't get near her? lol)

What I did wasn't okay. At some point, I took my guilt and never processed it and made her feel like it was her fault. It was basically gaslighting, even if I didn't know what to do. I should have challenged the idea.

I'm trying to share my journey (which is hard, too. I'm almost crying every day when I never cried, forcing myself to unrepress and go through vigorous CBT exercises every day) and stay in contact, but I hurt her so bad that she needs space from me. She qualified as an anxious-attachment sort. I'm in counseling, I ordered couples counseling and we're going to go through it... but, right now in this very time, as I'm writing my guilt journal shaking like a baby deer at the thought of abandonment (ie. She's so hurt she won't love me anymore, doesn't check my messages as much, etc) trying to re-read courses on talking / communicating with your partner, but I'm just so emotionally worked up I would just...

I would really like it if anybody else had a similar experience, or anything about repairing a relationship, how long it took, how many talks it took, when the emotional intimacy began to come back... just an outside perspective. Thank you.

One fear: I'm afraid, even though we have set times each week to talk, the time set apart and the lack of emotional intimacy will make her grow distant enough to not love me anymore. She said she wants to try, but despite what amazing times we had together throughout 2 years, this was bad enough for her to leave me for good. Sometimes the lack of it makes me so afraid I want to throw in the towel and quit - but that's the very thing I'm trying to fight. So yeah.

Sometimes when I talk to her about my recovery, she says, ""as long as you're doing it for yourself""... You don't understand, I'm \*trying\* to be vulnerable! I need exposure to force myself to get used to security. Ugh.",vumcs0,21,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vumcs0/da_break_up_repair_any_perspective/,AvoidantAttachment,0

718,Fear of Showing Attraction to Others {da},"Hello Everybody, Fellow DA here!

I have recently discovered my attachement style is dismissive avoidant and attempting to heal some of my previously limiting beliefs. 

For so long I have been almost incapable of showing or talking about my attraction to other people. Sexual attraction and desire are a part of myself that I have forced to repress for fear of being ostracised for my 'embarrassing' feelings and belief that I am unworthy of my beloved's attention. As someone who is currently single and actively dating this has caused many issues, namely:

1. Lack of ability to pick up on signals of attraction and flirting 
2. Coming off as disinterested or aloof
3. Being absolutely incapable of reciprocating (particularly verbal) affection even within a healthy, stable relationship
4. Feeling somewhat romance adverse, especially around traditionally romantic gestures eg. been given flowers

I am wanting to know if anyone else has struggled with something similar and how they worked to overcome.

719,"{fa}{da}{sa} Anyone worried awfully about the next time an AP would blow up at you about perceived ""abandonment""? (Friendships)","I consider myself SA with some light FA lean - I am pretty consistent around people whom I like, and dislike inconsistency and flakiness in others myself. Except when someone's inconsistency has a pattern - ex., I have lots of friends who vanish for a few days or weeks and they re-appear regularly. No issue there.

But the issue arises when I'm befriending new people. They take any tiny clue as a prophecy that I'm gonna abandon/ghost them. And, as typically self-fulfilling prophecy goes, I do indeed leave prematurely precisely because I don't want to feel constantly anxious cuz I know that they will snap again. I start feeling like I have to be twice as much (emotionally) available and ready to answer immediatelly at all cost, else I will have to deal with drama. - Keep in mind that this concerns ppl I don't date, and whom I barely know at that stage.

It just causes me so much anxiety. Anyone feels the same? Anyone found an effective way to ""ground"" themselves so they wouldn't get affected by people who can't control their reactions and take out their insecurities on others? *Edit: rephrasing:* my anxiety kicks in when people do this. It takes over me. Of course I cut them off. But the anxiety and fear of them doing that, oh boy. It's like I can smell people who want something from me from miles away.

It makes me feel really angry when someone snaps at me and makes me feel like I'm the asshole, before I even do anything. I always start isolating myself and avoiding forming social contact in general. I just don't have the energy to put up with it.

And again, I repeat, I am very regular with ppl in my close circle, we have no issues. It's always when I'm inviting new ppl into my life. I pull in both SA and Insecures with DA/FA and AP traits, and out of these two polar opposites, it rarely works out well with APs. Avoidants might be harder to connect with for me, but some of my longterm DA friends turned around and are quite Secure nowadays. It's not that I don't know how I could ""heal/help"" an AP, but oh my god, first, it's not my job, second, I am sick of feeling like people drag me down by taking out their own sh1t on me.

720,{da} Is this a therapy red flag?,"I had a traumatising breakup 6 months ago with an AP person. I made a lot of mistakes in the relationship, but so did he, and a lot of the things he said and did have deeply impacted me and my self-esteem.

I’ve been seeing a therapist since then who has helped me a lot. However, I still don’t feel fully recovered from everything that happened. I feel a lot of anger at my ex. And I feel like he did a lot of unacceptable things. And he really brought down my self esteem with his hot and cold behaviour and his cruel words and actions. 

My therapist doesn’t let me discuss specific incidents from the relationship, and she gets frustrated if I ever try to analyse the past relationship. She prefers for me to do reframing or rescripting exercises, and she says instead of analysing the past I should let it go. 

I don’t like the way she interrupts me to say “no, don’t try to analyse the past” and I don’t like that she uses a harsh tone to say it. Today I was crying about the breakup again and she was kind of annoyed and said “it’s your choice whether to stay depressed or to move on”. That just made me cry more!

She gave me some rescripting exercises to do where she asked me to list out the things I could have done better, how I can improve those things in my next relationship, and to figure out what my boundaries /needs are. But when I mentioned specific instances where my boundaries were crossed with my ex she said, no don’t dwell on the past, just list your boundaries. 

Is this normal? Am I wrong to still be upset about a breakup that happened 6 months ago? What hurts the most was that it was a very cruel and brutal discard, and after the breakup he said shitty things about me to mutual friends and said he’s been happier since the breakup. I get that I made mistakes and he has the right to do what he wants, but it still hurts. 

I have never dwelled on a past relationship this much before and I don’t know what to do. Is my therapist right?",uw44ce,20,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/uw44ce/da_is_this_a_therapy_red_flag/,AvoidantAttachment,0
721,friend realizes her avoidance for the first time,"So my unaware-best friend is something like FA/DA  in romantic relationships.

Several years ago, she met a guy at a festival who she felt an instant connection to. Afterwards, they never met again but he reached out to her about once a year to let her know he felt the connection and wanted to see her again.

Well, the other week, he reached out once more and asked her to meet and she agreed. Several days prior to the date, we were together the whole time and she ping-ponged between going and not going.

When she didn't want to go and considered canceling, I told her to go ahead and do it but she'd come up with reasons why she shouldn't cancel.

When I told her to go, she'd refuse and come up with reasons to not go.

When I asked her why she agreed in the first place, she said she felt a connection back then but wasn't interested in anything romantic. That she only wanted friendship and that if she feels that way about someone, she wants to explore. I told her its a bad idea to meet people who feel that and expect to be just friends. That it could potentially be stressful to constantly shoot them down if they keep pursuing.

But then she'd back peddle and talk about how she only felt that sort of instant connection with someone twice in her life and hadn't felt it since.

The first night, she canceled the date but understandably so. We were traveling to his city for other reasons and were worn out. They rescheduled for the following night. When that day came, she was incredibly anxious, unable to decide whether to go or not.

I finally broke down in plain English, her avoidance and how it was acting out (she'd never heard of AT before) and compared it to my ex situationship and that she was my former partner acting out.

It was pretty hilarious, her mind got completely blown. She previously never could understand my former partner's actions but suddenly, she empathized completely.

I was very proud of her for what came next. She realized she had to go on the date. She was so anxious however. For someone she wasn't that interested in, she started doing jumping jacks, was pacing the apartment, freaking out but steadily getting ready. She was crazy scared.

But when I explained why avoidance happens, she relayed back to her first love that ended horribly. She said she literally thought she was going to lose her friends and family. 

I told her to have no expectations of this date. That there is a high chance that what was there before is no longer there but the important thing is that she understands herself better now and she needs to face her fears to prepare for when she does meet that person who makes her heart flutter.

\---

That connection ended up not being there for her anymore but she was very pleased to have gone and said he was a very nice man and example of men she should date. Though there was a lot of tension, she said he seemed very secure and was comfortable to share vulnerable things and she liked that.",uv8aad,19,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/uv8aad/friend_realizes_her_avoidance_for_the_first_time/,AvoidantAttachment,0
722,How long does it take you to process a breakup? {fa},"I was broken up with by someone who I think is secure but I could be wrong. I was deactivating pretty intensely when it happened. I had deactivated a few times in the past but we always came back around to try to make it work. I think his patience finally ran out. 

Processing the reasons for the break up was hard but it gave me the push I needed to seek out therapy and want to work on myself. Unfortunately, not a week had gone by before he started to get involved with someone else. This just threw me through a loop of emotions and I started to feel like all of my thoughts I had while deactivating were being validated. It’s just been so difficult separating the reasons for the breakup and the fact that he found someone so quickly. I can’t stop thinking about him without having so many regrets and guilt. I also think that I wouldn’t even want to be in a relationship anymore, all the stress that comes along is so unappealing. 

This process has been so long and difficult. I’m struggling so much with the loss of someone I finally felt like I could try to be vulnerable with, while also accepting the facts.

727,How do i {FA} start feeling my feelings instead of suppressing them?,"it’s been 5 months since my breakup, and in those 5 months I cried and I thought that i grieved and that i moved on ,but i think i still have this subconscious belief that we’re gonna get back together eventually for some reason, even tho i know that that won’t happen and that it shouldn’t happen for a number of reasons, but i still can’t help it when i start imagining scenarios where we’re back together.

I just got caught off guard when i saw him in my Facebook memories this morning ,and even tho i blocked him ,it was so painful that I can’t go to his page and look at his face as much as i want to

I just saw him in someone else’s story (she posted a screenshot of their chat as joke) and even tho she’s in a relationship and not a “threat” it hurt so much ,because i felt so pathetic and like I can’t seem to move on while he already has , but even tho it hurt me in a way my feelings got suppressed as soon as they surfaced and in the span of 2 minutes i feel like kind of numb? Like i know it sucks but i feel nothing 

It also hits me when there’s like big problems or fighting in my home, i get hit with a lot of emotions ans thoughts that i think are the ones I suppress, and the front runner is that he’s not here anymore and i did this to myself, but again within minutes i feel like ”meh” I don’t really care anymore, Sometimes it makes me think that I’m just forcing myself to be sad for some reason!

729,{FA} Guilt and Expression,"I recently had a breakthrough in which I was able to express my feelings in the moment rather than days later and I felt so proud of myself. However, as I expected, that feeling did not last long.

Whenever I reveal how I feel, I am nearly immediately hit with guilt. I feel terrible because my feelings seem to be a catalyst for those around me. I am constantly worried about how they will be perceived and if they are causing pain.

I am very open about my struggles with being empathetic and my general appearance of apathy (which I feel is vastly exaggerated a lot of the time) but I think people always underestimate it, leading to resentment and a need to appease me.

Generally, I am described as coldhearted, blunt, lacking compassion, and just plain mean.

Am I expressing myself too harshly? Usually, I am considered too ambiguous with my words (fair, as I do try to play it nice) or too direct. I can never get it right. I don't think it's wrong to clearly state ""I do not like this behavior"", but somehow I am still made to feel like the worst person in the world.

730,Estranged parents? | {DA}{SA},"I think this post should have a general blanket trigger warning for toxic and enmeshed parenting. I think it’s relevant here to give us something to think about. 

This past week or so, I’ve fallen down a rabbit hole of reading about parental estrangement. I saw a post from AITA or something similar in which a parent was designated YTA, and told to look into [the missing missing reasons](http://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html). The further I dug, the more curious I became, and the more I confronted some things I’d been holding in the back of my mind but not quite facing yet. 

Of course, we talk so in depth about our romantic relational difficulties, and make reference to the fact that our caregivers weren’t what we needed, but viewing these things from a holistic sense and acknowledging them at the source is a bit of a different beast. To put it more plainly: learning how estranged parents view their estranged adult children (spoiler: it’s not favorably) was illuminating, disturbing, perfectly expected, and triggering all at once. 

When seeing snippets of how they behave and think, it makes my skin crawl.  It’s so polarizing of a topic, and therefore makes it difficult to bridge the gap. To an outsider, what kind of cruel heartless brat would hurt their poor parent after all they’ve done for you? They didn’t *beat* you. Abuse?! Ridiculous. As I’ve discovered in my rabbitholing, estranged parents consistently ask what they’ve done wrong, *just tell them what they’ve done wrong*, but when presented with reasons by their children, they’ll deny and dismiss those reasons swiftly. The truth is, they’re incapable of accepting blame or admitting fault as a trend, which is exactly what drives their children away. 

All this to say, it’s fascinating and painful to see attachment struggles play out in a zone that’s not romantic. Looking at the ways that estranged parents speak about, relate to and conceptualize of their estranged adult children is shockingly similar to how I’ve seen some AP folks talk about, relate to and conceive of their avoidant romantic partners. It’s been shown that estranged children distance themselves out of self preservation and fear, whereas estranged parents believe this is a personal attack carried out to hurt them specifically. 

Any of us who have ever been FA, been with a partner more DA than ourselves, or had FA leaning anxiety activated can know this pain and relate to the feeling— especially uneducated/unaware. However, the parent-child dynamic brings in some toxic cultural messaging that makes it harder to navigate. In my opinion, the romantic relationship evades the power differential that makes parent/child dynamics so fraught. If an adult AP ends up swept off their feet by a DA who promised them all these great things and then dropped them out of nowhere? Ya know what, yeah actually, they have a right to be a little mad and feel like they were duped. How they eventually handle that and work to better themselves is of course their own responsibility…

But a parent and child? A kid has no ability to consent to being born, to how they are raised, and to which parent they receive. The idea that a child owes anyone anything when they didn’t choose any of this is frustrating. It’s also sad to see the ways our culture punishes people for removing themselves from toxic situations. Equally disappointing is the fact that when searching for content around parental estrangement, the bulk of what I could find was parents in their 50s+ lambasting their kids as toxic narcissistic selfish brats, trying to get back at them by removing them from their will (trust me, I don’t need monetary and tangible items… I want an attuned parent who respects and listens to me). There was not enough help out there for children struggling with the potential choice to estrange, instead it was all there to guilt trip and coerce them back into toxic dynamics. I did find one therapist on YouTube’s podcast, “The Reconnection Club”. I liked her content a lot, and if a parent is actually capable of growth, I could see it being very healing for them.

731,Anyone else avoid thinking about their avoidance..? {da},"To elaborate, it's been a few years since I realized that I have avoidance issues. And to this day, I tune them out. I just really cringe up at all the self-reflection that goes into therapy & recovery. 

For instance, its excruciatingly painful for me to actively ponder the (mostly unspoken) issues in my own long-term relationship. Whenever I do spend time thinking on the relationship - my mind goes to breaking up, and I get pretty negative, critical, and eventually depressed. 

So for the most part, I don't think about it. Tune the problems out. Deal with them as they come. The unspoken stuff is background noise. And the rest of life is so busy..! 

I also get pretty annoyed with other people & their drama. For example, my siblings and their relationship issues with their SO's. I find myself dismissing (pretty much eye rolling at) the problems of others. I promise that I care about the people close to me - just don't have the patience for the over-analyzing of their problems lol.

And honestly, if I was to act on my avoidance, I might not have any close relationships with anyone. I'm so internally irritated and dismissive half the time. 

Anyone here relate? If so, do you believe that full transparency is always the right answer - or can it sometimes be best to keep things peacefully swept under the rug..?",tnygsq,20,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tnygsq/anyone_else_avoid_thinking_about_their_avoidance/,AvoidantAttachment,0

I have has significant problems in all of my romantic/sexual relationships with (what I thought was) the pursuer/distancer dynamic. After falling down the internet, instead of sleeping, it looks like I am most likely FA with DA tendency. All of the pieces make my life make so much more sense.

While there was an initial feeling of relief at finding a reason so many of my relationships are so damn dysfunctional, relief was quickly replaced by dread when I started looking at how to heal. While I have been to therapy over the years, it has never been with a focus on my attachment style. Everything I read has said that I need focus on identifying, feeling, and communicating my emotions. Frankly, I would rather peel off my skin, light it on fire, and then roll in salt. I'm sorry, but feeling my emotions is a load bearing neurosis, if I start working on that my whole mental house of cards is going to fold like a cheap lawn chair.

734,Epiphany about being {FA},"I never quite understood why I have a fearful avoidant attachment style. It took me so long to realize that I have both enmeshment trauma and abandonment trauma. One narcissistic parent, one depressed and anxious parent.

I noticed my romantic encounters mimic the relationship I had with my narcissistic parent. When I feel them leaving me I go insane. I stop eating, I can't sleep, I run circles in my head about the situation that caused the abandonment (usually me speaking up for myself). I blame myself for their bad behavior. I always end up apologizing first and trying to soothe them despite them traumatizing ME. I chase and I give all myself. I lose my identity.

Now as if today I'm realizing I deal with the opposite. My enmeshed parent has spent too long being abandoned and has anxiety themselves. I often become their care taker. I calm them down when they're having anxiety attacks. I cook for the. I clean for them. I take care of some of their responsibilities because I know they're going through a lot and life is hard for them. But just like with my narcissistic parent, I STILL end up abandoning myself to take care of someone else.

With my enmeshed parent I have to be okay for both of us. Because if I'm not okay, *they're not okay*. I think this is where my avoidant side comes out. I always thought I was only anxious attachment because of my romantic partners. I mostly focused on situations where I was being abandoned and acted out as a result (usually leaving me embarrassed, scared, exhausted etc). These emotions are harder for me to work through.

But enmeshment can be just as insidious. Sometimes I can't be okay for both of us. And that's when the snooping and confrontation starts. With this parent they don't listen to the problems I tell them I need help with. Yet, when they noticed a change in my behavior they only get nosy. This is not true care for my needs. This is them frantically wondering why im not catering to them emotionally or what I'm thinking of them It feels selfish. This makes me want to run.

Especially if it so happens that they are the problem. They can't handle what I'm feeling and thinking of them. Unfortunately this happens with the Narcissistic parent too. So I have to stuff myself and pretend everything is okay and care for them while resentment grows. I just want them to go away.

I'm not sure where I'm going with this. I don't know what to do or where to start with my issues. I have so many of them. I attach to romantic partners that are unavailable, I want to run from the people who desperately need me, I abandon myself all the time.

736,Avoidance and intimacy,"I’m about equal parts FA and DA and sometimes I find the early sexual encounters in dating really hard. Making out after a good date is no problem but once the expectation for more is there I get really anxious. I’ve had better luck with casual sexual encounters because I feel more uninhibited.

Recently I had a 3rd date with a guy and even invited him back to my place. We spent a couple hours talking on my couch and I kept the conversation going because I felt like the expectation was there and somewhere in the middle of the convo I had just decided I wasn’t into it. I told him I was exhausted after a long week and I feel like he was blindsided. He went home and I decided I don’t think I want to see him anymore.

Typically I find between dates 3-5 is when I withdraw and stop seeing someone and also usually around when I have sex with them. I feel like there has to be some correlation. It’s much easier for me to open up sexually if I’m not fully sober (but like buzzed not blackout) so I rarely have sex unless I feel more loose.

I definitely am a sexual person but I just feel so particular when it comes to who I can actually get on that level with and sometimes after I do it makes me like them less

737,Why does it sometimes feel like physical intimacy is easier than emotional intimacy?,"Or that I can bridge the gap with touch. It takes a while for me to warm up and I'm tired of people not understanding or thinking something is wrong. Yet, touch is an easy way to feel close in the absence of words. But touch devoid of feeling is also a void. 

It's easier for me to be vulnerable in one area vs the other, maybe because my love languages are touch and quality time. I don't like talking with my boyfriend on the phone as much as I do when we're in person and I can touch him as we talk. I'm a very private person, I can like you but that won't change how I am naturally. I just took a while to feel people out even if I like you, I don't just give into those feelings I wait. In those waiting periods I still desire closeness in some way.

738,My birthday is tomorrow,"At this point in life, I'm old enough that it's just another day. The real issue is the birthday card I got in the mail from my dad. Unfortunately, my relationship with him (or lack thereof) is one of those deeply buried hurts that I've somehow managed to reveal recently.

My dad is the best example of a hardcore DA that I've ever seen. When I was growing up, he wasn't ever really involved. He was physically present, but he would go to work, come home, and stay in another room. No interaction really. I don't remember him joining us at the dinner table. I don't remember him ever showing me affection. I don't remember him every asking how I was.

Some of the most painful memories I have:  
\- When I was 2 or 3 he spanked me so hard and I was scared. I remember crying on the floor of my bedroom and him laying next to me apologizing, but the damage was done. That's probably where my freeze response began.  
\- I used to have to get IV steroid treatments weekly for an autoimmune disease. One time the nurses kept blowing my veins and it hurt so much. I was probably 10 or 11. He comforted me, rubbed my head and promised he would buy me McDonald's because I was doing such a good job. On the way home, he didn't get me McDonald's. My therapist says this is the moment I truly believed my dad didn't care about me.  
\- My mom told me when I was a few months old, I was hospitalized for bronchitis. She had been with me for well over 48 hours without a break or shower. My dad was supposed to come give her a break. He showed up hours later than expected because he went to Kmart to shop for work pants. While his child was in the hospital. As I baby I wasn't even more important to him than work pants. Obviously I don't remember this but the knowledge is painful.  
\- I was in a head on accident when I was 16. When the lady with me called my dad to tell him (I was living with him at the time post parent's divorce), his first response was ""I'm not paying the medical bills."" And at no point did he ask if I was okay.  
\- He had me committed to a psych ward because I had old self harm scars. It was a peak depression time for me so I didn't pass the screener and away I went. Because I was a minor, they did family therapy. I expressed how much it hurt that he would come home and stay in another room. His response? ""I didn't like what you guys were watching on tv."" That was hurtful, and I said it was bullshit. I got punished for not cooperating, and that's when I learned that my feelings don't matter and expressing them could result in punishment (cue abusive relationships that reinforced this).  
\- He kicked me out of his apartment with my 9 month old baby because I left my bedroom door open to try to cool the room down. He said it would raise his bill.

I feel like there's probably a lot more, and my therapist wants to address this in EMDR. I know I need to. I know my dad's behavior and the interactions with him are at the core of my avoidance. And definitely at the core of my poor relationship track record. We don't currently have a relationship. I went years without seeing him at all, maybe until my oldest was 7 or 8. Then I would do holidays for the kids, but it just didn't feel right. It felt like I was interacting with a stranger.

So I get this birthday card, and there's always money. I recognized his handwriting and knew right away. ""Happy birthday. Love you, Dad."" Do you though? Because I don't want money on holidays. I want a dad who cares about me. I was thinking about it at work and started crying. I thought maybe I should be the bigger person and try to repair the relationship. Write him a letter and tell him how I feel and see if we can move forward. But at the same time, why do I have to do that? I'm the child.

I'm not even mad at this point. I understand that he did the best he could, and I've forgiven him. But I'm still really hurt. I still have internalized his behavior as if I've done something wrong, or there's something wrong with me. I still struggle to accept that any man could love me, because it feels like the one man who was supposed to always love me unconditionally doesn't. And if he couldn't, why would anyone else?

Avoidant Attachers:

**For those of you who use social media:**

1) Does your social media behavior/activity change after an ending/break up? How so?

&#x200B;

2) Blocking - do you block after an ending, and if yes, when and why?

&#x200B;

3) Unblocking - if you unblock an ex, why?

&#x200B;

4) When/if watching an ex or former friend's stories, or reacting to their post, what is your motive?  Is there some hidden meaning behind this? Just general curiosity? An accident - already watching other stories and theirs plays automatically? Other? (The FAQ is usually, ""My ex watched my IG story, what does this mean? Is he/she still in love with me?"")

I recently had sex with an fwb and when she asked to cuddle I agreed cause I wanted to practice acting secure. she seemed to really enjoy it but the whole thing was very uncomfortable for me and now I’m completely deactivated. I just feel icky thinking about it and I’m in self isolation mode.

741,My Head is Spinning,"
Just prior to moving, the chemistry ramped up and eventually we acted on the chemistry. 

Being avoidant, I usually separate myself from anyone I have been intimate with or even have a connection with. Being that we have to coexist, I really haven’t able to do that. I tried to sabotage by being distant and weird. He sees me for me. Tonight he called me out for being so guarded and I almost cried (I don’t really cry in front of people). I hate that he actually sees past my masks, but also love that about him. 

Ultimately I’m scared because in 46 years, no one has really challenged me for who I am - I’d like to think that I want to change because despite a million reasons why I think it would never work- he may be worth being authentic with. 

Has anyone successfully worked past their instincts to have a meaningful, open and authentic relationship? If so, how? I honestly don’t how to get beyond the fear.

742,I have a complete aversion to dating,"I (33f) recently discovered (via the internet) that I seem to be a textbook case of avoidant attachment. But I’m not seeing a lot of people whose dating experience compares to mine. 

A little background: I was painfully shy as a kid and have moderate social anxiety. My parents coddled me and never really tried to push me out of my comfort zone. As an adult, I’m fiercely independent, probably as overcompensation for the lack of freedom I had as a kid.  

In addition, I was kind of a late bloomer maturity wise. I was never really into boys or had any interest in dating until after college. Maybe a few small crushes but that’s it. I’ve kissed 4 guys and had one actual relationship. When I was 26, I moved to a new city. Met one guy who was nice enough, but I never planned for it to last long. We dated for 7 months, we had sex twice (my last and only times). I didn’t hate it or anything I just wasn’t that into him. I broke it off when he started getting too serious. In retrospective, I definitely used him to meet friends and get relationship experience, which is shitty to admit, but that’s what it was. 

It wasn’t until 2 years later when I decided to try a dating app. I met one guy for drinks. I won’t say there was a major spark but we had a nice conversation. I would have gone out again if he had asked. I came home, and just cried. And I rarely cry. I still don’t know why. 

About 3 years later, last week. I decided to try again as I’ve been feeling really lonely lately. I swiped on very few people. Matched with someone. We didn’t small talk much he just asked me to drinks and a comedy show. The entire day I was super anxious and just really not excited at all. I cancelled at the last minute. 

It seems like a lot of avoidants can easily get into relationships, but then withdraw when it gets serious. I can’t even get close enough to withdraw. Is this common? Is my avoidance exacerbated by my social anxiety? I’ve always thought romantic relationships were just not that important to me, but I do crave human connection. What am I missing?

I get the avoidant part of not being able to confront his issues and just running away. 

The part that confuses me is, why didn’t he just break up with me? Why try to plant it in my head? I’d ask him if that’s what he wants and he would say absolutely not, but that he doesn’t want me to feel stuck with him or hate him. I’d get sad that he’d suggest it because I didn’t want to break up either.

745,Need advice on how to continue a relationship with DA boyfriend,"I'm honestly at my wits end here.

Our relationship started so beautifully. He was very outgoing, very affectionate and loving, and wanted me to be a positive force in his life. He seemed very excited to be in a serious relationship with someone like me, he went as far to say that he has never felt this way about someone before. One month later, things slowly just got worse. 

He slowly starts to get much more distant. After one serious discussion (that was not even about our relationship), this is when he started to pull away. Since then, it seems like he is constantly bringing issues up out of nowhere. I've held my ground and been incredibly patient, but it really starts to wear on you when your partner treats you like an acquaintance more than anything. Today, he talked to me about all these terribly negative things. ""I want to go slower"", ""my feelings are almost platonic for you now"", and a plethora of weird fears he has that are seemingly coming from nothing. He says he feels suffocated when he starts to get close to someone. He is constantly contradicting himself with these reasons and I'm having a hard time actually understanding what any of this means.

I am securely attached, I do not have unhealthy issues with my relationships and I know my boundaries very well. I have been so incredibly patient and accommodating with his avoidant-ness, but there comes a point when this is starting to affect my own self esteem. I never receieve any affection, I constantly need to be giving him space, and I've honestly just learned to never expect anything romantic from him.

I cannot communicate that I feel neglected, otherwise this pushes him away even further. I am a very emotionally open person who usually has no issue confronting issues at hand, but I feel like I may just be going about this the wrong way. I haven't dated someone like this before.

Anyone who is DA, please lend advice. I feel worthless honestly and I don't know what his problem is, I have sincerely done nothing wrong yet he pushes me away. I do not know how to traverse this as he seems extremely volatile.",o8l4l0,19,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/o8l4l0/need_advice_on_how_to_continue_a_relationship/,AvoidantAttachment,0

750,Regular Avoidance Vs Attachment Avoidance {DA},,14me5aj,19,0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zECP-lWaDY,AvoidantAttachment,0
751,{FA} Not sure if am trying to confess or project here?,"Lately I have been feeling like the only one in my relationship who is ""emotionally vulnerable"". My partner and I have been dating for almost a year now. The only times we have ever had any sort of ""emotionally vulnerable"" moments are when I bring up things that I have anxiety about or struggle with or have trouble understanding. Never my partner. And so it's gotten me down this negative rabbit hole of thought that I am the only one who brings these up. And the rabbit hole is that it's either because I am the *only one* with these problems or because she doesn't trust me enough to be ""vulnerable"" with me.

Which brings me to part of my problem with what I define as ""emotionally vulnerable"". Because I can't really define it. Does it mean bringing up your insecurities and anxieties? Your fears? Things that make you sad or anxious? Because if that's what that it is, I'm the only one who does it. My partner never brings up any of these things that bother her and it makes me feel like I'm broken and a burden any time I bring these up. Like I'm tipping the scale too much in my direction for making things all about me or all about my issues or like I'm some covert narcissist who needs to bring attention to MY issues all the time (she has never ever made me feel this, I'm just catastophizing). 

I feel like I don't know her on a deep level because she never tells me any of these deep thoughts that are going through her mind like I am. And the trouble is I don't even know what I mean by ""deep thoughts"". I feel like for me a deep thought is the ROCD things I struggle with. I just feel like I know my partner on a surficial level while she knows my deepest, darkest wounds and things that bring me anxiety.

I can't tell if she is just emotionally secure and doesn't have any of these issues or if she doesn't trust me to get vulnerable or just doesn't feel like talking about them at all. And I feel like I don't really know her that much as a result. Which makes me feel like I'm projecting my own belief that in order for you to be emotionally vulnerable you need to confess your worries or fears or anxities. 

Like what does it mean to be emotionally vulnerable with your partner? What does it mean to have a deep, emotional connection with them? Every aspect of our relationship is technically perfect. We don't argue or fight or do anything that annoys one another. We go out on dates all the time and share similar hobbies. Yet I feel like it's all just surficial. Like I don't know anything that's going on in her head like mine.

I feel like I'm just trying to self-sabotage here but I also just feel like I don't know my partner on a deeper level. I'm the only one who ever goes ""Hey, can I tell ya something that's been on my mind lately"" or ""Hey, can I talk to you about this anxiety I've been having"". I just have trouble discerning what that means for a neurotypical person versus neurodivergent. I don't know what emotional vulnerability looks like for neurotypicals. I feel like I'm trying to squeeze something out of my partner even when I do check-ins every so often and she tells me everything is great.

I just don't know how to bring up the fact that I feel like I'm the only one who is emotionally vulnerable and have trouble feeling like I know her on a deeper emotional level without coming off as accusatory or hurtful. I don't want to make it feel like I'm pressuring her into saying shit. I just want to know what I'm supposed to feel because I feel like I feel nothing and I don't know how to process any of this.

I'm so scared I keep trying to create mountains out of molehills. Like I'm just TRYING to create an issue out of thin air because my ADHD and anxiety riddled brain NEEDS some sort of stimulation or drama or chaos. It's so exhausting.",13ks60j,19,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/13ks60j/fa_not_sure_if_am_trying_to_confess_or_project/,AvoidantAttachment,0

753,There's something about seeking relationship advice on social media that is pervasive to me {FA},"This isn't the only attachment theory based group I'm on. There are a few on Facebook as well, which is probably home to the really offensive posts as it's more common to attach screenshots. But there is really something pervasive about going into detail about your partner's behavior, sharing screen shots of actual conversations and asking thousands of strangers to judge what's happening, and seeking validation in this way. 

I myself have been guilty of it for sure. As someone in a mostly functioning avoidant/avoidant relationship that also experiences the anxious-avoidant trap and has successfully navigated around it a few times, I like to share my story. Kind of a ""not all avoidants"" point of view that we don't really see often. But when I present my story, I try my best to be neutral. I don't just share all the things my boyfriend is doing wrong. I share the things I've done wrong and take accountability. I also try to share the things he's done right. 

Maybe I'm not as far removed from my first paragraph as I think I am. I just see all of these posts and imagine how I would feel if my partner did that to me. How would I feel to see screenshots with very little context of our entire dynamic posted for the world to see? Screenshots of things that I sent to someone I trust most in the world. Screenshots that likely came from a moment when I was emotionally triggered and at my ""worst."" I would feel really shitty. 

I've actually had my boyfriend read my Reddit history and be upset about something that I said. Was it true? Yes. But even though I had no ill intention, seeing me say that on the internet impacted him in a negative way. He was still bringing it up months later. 

Anyway, I guess I just wanted to see if any other avoidants relate.

754,Reminder: Please review and follow sub rules {DA}{FA}{AP},"We have noticed an increase in the rules being skirted or broken, and want to remind everyone to please review and follow the sub rules. Here are a few that stand out lately. 

* **Rule #1: This is a pro-avoidant sub.** While we allow participation from all attachment styles in one way or another, this is still an avoidant sub meant to be a safe space. If you violate this rule, it could result in an immediate ban. 
* **Rule #5: AP and AP leaning users are limited to participating in the recurring Relationship Thread.** This is not up for debate by these users. We will not be changing this rule. If you are looking for support, please visit r/AnxiousAttachment. If you are looking to openly participate with all attachment styles, please visit r/attachment_theory. 
* **Rule #6: Keep comments relevant to OP.**  Do not derail the OP in the comments. Keep comments relevant to what is in the OP. If you have a question or comment that will spark it's own discussion, please create your own OP. Derailing may result in your comment being locked/removed. 
* **Rule #10: User flair fraud** \-  Assigning yourself a user flair that is not accurate based on things written in posts and comments in order to skirt our posting rules will result in an immediate and permanent ban from the sub. 
* **Rule #11: Keep the focus on you as much as possible.** Posts and comments should be about YOUR experience, not anyone else's. Relationship advice can be asked on the recurring weekly thread by all users. 

While we do welcome fearful avoidants to participate, it is common for FAs to lean either avoidant or anxious. We understand that this can change based on the relationship or situation. In order to follow the sub rules, any post/comment made by a user that is highly anxious or very obviously more centered on a DA partner or ex will be removed. 

We have worked hard to create and maintain a safe space for avoidants. Restricting the sub has helped a lot, but we are concerned there is an increase in users intentionally choosing the wrong flair to participate. We encourage you to report anything you feel has egregiously violated sub rules to bring it immediately to mod attention for review.

756,"{FA}Positive for Huntingtons, and Feeling Bleak About Love","I hope to hear from people who fell in love with individuals with progressive diseases, especially if it changed the individual's personality.
I'm a sucker for love stories but in the last couple years I'm more jaded and I'm not pursuing romance or intimacy. I'm scared because I'm going to become this toxic person for my partner  my disease progresses. 
In ten years I'm going to be self-centered, easily angered, less reliable, and probably meaner. So I feel like my love story is gonna be sad and burdensome.
But people with this disease need love and support from their community and family if they are to live well.

757,{fa} How can I resolve the space I created in my relationship?,"I always thought I was an anxious attachment. It turns out I'm an avoidant who is mostly secure, but there are blips.

My relationship wasn't going so well for a few months. We spent too much time together and his flaws affected our relationship (forgetfulness, his lack of empathy, hygiene, etc). I'd get very stressed and angry every time I felt he did something wrong, especially after intimate convos. 

I moved out and we're taking a break. But I realize I may have done something wrong (even tho a 30 year old man should shower, brush his teeth, clean up after himself IN my apt, have some common sense, act kind to his GF!!!!). 

I'm just totally emotionless right now and my sex drive has tanked terrible with my BF. I can't even get off on my own. I'm repulsed by intimacy with him and I feel like he's a burden in my space.

758,I “deactivated” and pushed him away. We talked it out eventually. Now I want him back. {fa},"I tried posting this on dating and ask men community and just got ripped to shreds.

I was seeing a good friend of mine for a few months. I always really enjoyed his company and he made me feel safe. We started going on dates and I noticed a few things start to happen: I stopped finding him attractive, and his pursuit of me became “needy” and I felt like he was putting me on a pedestal. This led to me getting annoyed and irritated everytime he’d try to hang out with me and I ended up having an honest conversation with him saying I’m just going through a lot and I can’t do this right now. He took it very well, we are still friends.

Now that I have space, I look at him again and miss him. I want to talk him, hang out with him, I even long to touch him when we’re together in group settings. I don’t want to go back to him because I don’t trust myself. But I want him because he’s the best man I know. I know that if I put all my shit aside, we could have an extremely loving relationship. 

I only recently realized this was most likely “deactivation”. Once I spoke to him honestly it’s like all those feelings (resentment, disgust, how could he like me - something must be wrong with him??) all went out the window.

I guess my question is should I continue to not pursue this with him? Leave him alone? I know I should, but now that I’m out of that spiral I feel so guilty, and like I lost something really valuable. :(

760,How to start healing? {da} 29F,"First of all reading this sub makes me very sad because it's touching a place I normally bury away and ignore. A lot of the posts are really relatable and it also brings up a lot of trauma with my mom that has caused my DA. 

I've never had a real relationship and that fueled my thought's of 'See I'm not good enough if I'm not worth persueing' and 'Life is better this way, love can only hurt you'. I could only talk about this with people when I was drunk, because drugs and alcohol where als a coping mechanism to keep my feelings at bay. Then I learned about attachment styles and I slowly started talking to my closest friends about what I suspected. Last year I started therapy, the psychologist wanted to diagnose me with an avoidant personality disorder but I refused that; I only have trouble with relationships the rest of my life is succesful and stable. I started individual schema-therapy and did some EDMR for the trauma's.  I've had 6 sessions of therapy so it's to soon to see the results. 

Reading this sub has made me realise I'm not alone in this but it does come with some harsh realisations: There are some key-convictions I need to break down that I didn't even know I had.

The most important one: 'I have to be strong, persevere and do everything alone. People can't be trusted and are not good enough'. But how do I change this conviction? 

I am a social worker working with highly agressive addicted people, I'm now starting to think my job only strengthens my view on people:  'I am strong and try to save them while they try to tear me and themself down'. I also try to give them something I didn't have: security.  I'm now questioning my job and the savior-complex that comes with it'. 

I also have a lot of friends diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and also feel attracted to some. But ofcourse when it comes to close I turn cold. I suspect something about both our disfunctional attachment styles attracts each other. 

I want to heal but I feel like I'm hitting a wall; I know I'm 'fucked up' but what now? 

Disclaimer: I don't think people with DA, or BPD or any mental health problems are 'fucked up' or have anything against social work.",xh9zxa,19,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/xh9zxa/how_to_start_healing_da_29f/,AvoidantAttachment,0
761,Drawn to then turned off by crush {fa},"Hello insightful healees❤ I'd love your perspective on a story from my past.

From grade 6- my early 20s, there was a boy I (think) I was crushing on. I'd write about him in my diary all the time for years. He became one of my closest friends, I desperately wanted his attention, to be close to him, for him to want me. I was so drawn to him and his humor and silliness.

Confusing thing is, I'd go back and forth between thinking he was cute, to feeling almost... repulsed by him. Turned off. Extremely critical and ""zoomed in"" on his appearance. It was very confusing to feel all these things for someone I cared deeply for.

To this day, I feel confused about my intense feelings for him. Was he just a safe person that I was trying to attach to, because I felt desperate for that- so attachment issues? Did I actually have a massive crush, and was the repulsion and judgment protective mechanisms from getting too close? Was I just desperate for attention?
I also struggle a lot with doubt and validating my feelings. Somatic experiencing has helped me immensely over the years, but I haven't gotten any insight into this situation yet.

Thanks for reading, and for any ideas/thoughts❤",x5otkf,19,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/x5otkf/drawn_to_then_turned_off_by_crush_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
762,Keep to myself or reach out? {FA},"There's honestly a lot I'm struggling with and need to figure out, but I want to keep this post as succinct as possible, so I won't get into it all here.

Basically, I've been in an extreme self-loathing spiral/depressive state for the past couple months (probably longer, if I'm honest), and my avoidant tendencies have intensified accordingly. I've become increasingly dysfunctional in my daily life, and I'm barely holding on in the wake of a recent surgery which has imposed limitations on the most valuable coping mechanism I have (exercise, particularly walking and bodyweight). I've had opportunities to develop social connections that I've more or less let completely wither away as a result.

That said, I do have an extremely caring and supportive friend who's pretty much always happy to talk to me and possibly hang out. We have a rather fraught history together, and lots of little things they say and do trigger me in some way (feelings of inadequacy, rejection, claustrophobia, etc).

Honestly, my avoidant instincts coupled with morality OCD-based guilt and general feelings of self-hatred dispose me towards completely isolating myself. I feel justified in this, since I clearly have to work on myself before getting involved with people.

...Except, I know that humans need positive social connection, and that negative self-image and self-hatred can be caused or exacerbated by social isolation. Furthermore, problems are rarely addressed long term by running away from them, which is really what I've been doing this whole time, in typical avoidant style.

So, the question is: do I try to push myself into maintaining regular contact with my friend, who is constantly affirming how much they love and care about me, and possibly even forming more positive relationships through them (they have a sizeable social circle, relatively), all while being forced to confront the triggers and fears that brings up for me? Is that even fair of me, given how unreliable and (at times) unstable I am?

Or should I continue my isolation and somehow try to figure out how to hate myself a little less first so I can show up for them just as much as they do for me? How do I even do that?

763,"Can anyone else relate to experiencing/having experienced ""ego-death"" or ""dark night of the soul"" {fa}{da}?","I am curious how many believe that they have experienced ego-death/dark night of the soul. 

I think it is different from the recognition of finding attachment theory and relating to it. 

What I refer to is such soul-shaking epiphany that it may have left you feeling hanging on a thread of your sanity, while you receive massive downloads of information that uproot the ego and often leave a person in despair while going through it. It can be a reunion with the inner-child after never having experienced the inner-child before. It can be to experience ""the wailing""; to hear crying come from within that you were not even aware of.

764,I had a good day {FA},"I just wanted to share possible progress in my FA. 

I met a man today while out for a walk,  and we had a lovely time talking about deep matters. I made him double up laughing and it struck me how much I've missed interesting masculine conversation. I liked that he didn't flirt, we just had so much to talk about, for over an hour.

I'm aware he's got a lot going on in his life and I know I'm not over my ex. All the same, it gave me a lift when he said it was incredible to talk to someone at the level we did. Now that I know I'm FA, I was more confident and able to not linger and people-please or abruptly run away when he tried to extend our conversation. I was relieved he didn't ask for my number though because I'm not ready to go on a date. Happenchance he lives in the same hamlet as my ex, possibly a quarter of a mile. I didn't mention my ex ofc or my familiarity with the area, no need.

766,Feeling heartbroken… I {fa} fell in love with best friend and he doesn’t feel the same.,"After a wild 3 years, one of my closest friendships culminated in a teary phone call last night. One of my friends and I became very close… and through the course of a tumultuous season in my life, engaged in several romantic interactions while he offered tremendous emotional and friendly support.

Last night, he admitted that he does not have romantic feelings for me, although we have an amazing connection and attraction to one another. He admitted to dating other women after I told him he had my full attention and to please not put me on a “carousel of confused lady friends” or “lead me on as a placeholder.” He told me the reason he held my hand was because he didn’t want to bat my hand away. He said we travel together, talk everyday and hang out weekly because he enjoys my company. And he minimized our intimacy, saying he never wanted to engage in it (note: there were SEVERAL interactions over the last few years). He says he cares for me, and that I am important to him. He begged me not to hate him and said he was sorry.

He has come on strong (setting up time together, texting daily, trips, intimacy) and then abruptly backed off before- and it always made sense given where I was in my life. But, now, I’ve working diligently on being so much more stable, secure, open, and vulnerable. I’ve genuinely tried to be fair and patient. 

I truly want to experience healthy love and part of me is terrified of the onslaught of anger, sadness, and protective measures that are engulfing me right now. I don’t want to go back to having such high walls that men have to aggressively break my boundaries just to show me they care. I wanted to believe my best friend cared for me differently. I want to believe I’m worthy and hard to dismiss… but… This. Keeps. Happening.

However, I have a horrible relationship with a narcissistic father. Recently I remembered/my mom reminded me that he noticed me distancing myself from him and not wanting to be near him already around the age of 3. 

As a side note, I feel like he’s using this fact to blame me for things I can’t even remember. It’s a good time.

Although this was a surprise, it makes sense, as I can’t remember ever feeling safe, happy, and comfortable around my father.

769,I feel like I'm watching a {DA} or {FA} be created in front of my own eyes (realizing why I am the way I am too),"I really need to show up for my little brother. I really do. I noticed the same patterns that happened with me are being repeated with him and it's why i try to protect him when I am able. But I cant for the life of me meet his emotional needs (wanting to play and talk).

He makes me really uncomfortable and don't know why. Although I try to show affection anyway (cooking for him, smiling at him when I talk, giving him hugs when he asks, letting him show me things).

Anyway, I feel like I'm slowly watching him become avoidant. I watch how my mom interacts with him. I don't think she realizes now critical she can be. It's like she's critical to him first, and when he shows a negative reaction, she feels guilty and needs him to assure her that he's not upset with her. And I don't like this. I'll try to give some examples.

On his birthday last year, we were going to my uncles house to celebrate. She kept rushing him to get ready. Getting mad him and basically yelled at him for moving too slow. He didn't say anything but you can tell he looked sad. So she asked him what's wrong. He said nothing. I could tell she felt guilty.

It's like she yelled at him... On his birthday... And didn't understand why he was sad? Weird. But I see this a lot. Parents upsetting their children and then needing the child to soothe the parents guilt.

Another thing. She never asks about him first. I've watched her send him away and look annoyed when he wanted attention. He got used to this. So he doesn't bother anymore. He spends his time talking with friends online. Now she says things like ""why doesn't he talk to me anymore?"", ""he never greets me"". And even making HIM feel guilty about it. I watched her walk in his room asking if he's okay because he didn't talk to her all day and was wondering why he didn't.

How is he supposed to? Just two days ago I watched her taunt him because he was asking for something. I watch her mock the way he speaks. His mannerism. While he's in within earshot. I dont like when she drags me in too. Trying to get me to make fun of him. I just stare at her and say nothing. It makes me uncomfortable and it honestly annoys me.

Ive watched her criticize his art, laughing at the way it looks. I've watched her make him dance in front of us while he was crying (I think it was over a game but still). When he was learning to write I saw her yell at him telling him his letters were horrible and to make it better. But when he cries she gets frustrated with him.

I also don't like how she coddles him. Everytime I try to teach him independence she doesn't want me to and tells me to focus on myself (but oh, when he's hungry and she doesn't feel like making him food, then she sends him to me. Nice). I feel like this is messing with his confidence. I noticed he struggles to make decisions for himself because my mom is always doing it for him. And I don't understand why.

When my mom was still working out side the house I would have my little brother work on chores. And while he was resistant at first, he was very PROUD of himself when he was done. When I would have him cook with me he was PROUD of himself. I don't understand why my mom doesn't encourage this.

She actively stops him from learning independence and then turns around and calls him lazy and says he acts like she's his slave (because she always cooks and cleans for him when he can do it himself). She doesn't encourage him to have good hygiene and then makes fun of him for being dirty.


I just wonder does she realize she's doing this? Because I don't think she's a bad person. She a great mom in other ways but when it comes to the emotional aspect she's not good. She's very cold and logical, there other times where she is warm and able to show up emotionally. But for the most part she can be very dismissive. I've watched her be critical of herself too where it wasn't needed.

I just feel bad for everyone involved. I noticed my mom is more critical and impatient when she's stressed out (doesn't help she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety). My little brother's dad is just an awful person so he's no help. My older brother is practically our dad but he works so he's not even home most of the time. It's just so stressful here.",t5qjd3,20,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/t5qjd3/i_feel_like_im_watching_a_da_or_fa_be_created_in/,AvoidantAttachment,0
770,{FA} How do you manage getting triggered when you're in front of the person who triggered you?,"I've got a lot better at managing my behaviour when I'm not around the object of the trigger. Whether I feel like I'm deactivating or I start feeling anxious, I can sit with it for a while and get back to the person in a more even keel usually.

However, when I'm physically with someone and I get triggered, I don't have time to ground myself and I end up doing something weird. For example, I've been seeing this guy for a couple of months. Not sure where it's going yet, but we got into a bit of a rhythm of staying over at mine or his on Saturday.

I didn't see him last weekend as I was away, but we got lunch the week before and this week, which he suggested as I wouldn't be around that weekend. He was a bit quieter this past week, and on Saturday we went out for a drink and to grab some dinner. He had been out the night before and had been helping with some home renovations in the morning so he was really tired and not quite there, and I was finding it hard to keep the conversation going with him.

After dinner, he said he was exhausted and was going to head home, unless I wanted to get another drink or something? I had assumed we'd be having a sleepover as we hadn't last weekend, but when I asked if he wanted to come to mine or I stay at his, he declined as he was really tired. I kinda froze and just wanted to get out of there, so I said I was just going to head home then. He said he'd walk me to the tram stop and when we got there, there were only a couple of minutes left for the tram to arrive but I REALLY wanted to get out of there so I told him I was just going to walk to another tram stop nearby, hugged him goodbye and pretty much sprinted off.

At home, I could review the situation. I realised I was feeling insecure this week as things had felt like more of a friendly vibe between us (we don't really do PDA) and with the conversation not flowing and him not wanting to stay over, I felt rejected. But all I could feel at that moment was the cortisol running through my body and how I didn't want to speak to him again, and I didn't really calm for a while. If I had, I probably wouldn't have left like the devil was after me, and would have thanked him for meeting me even if he was exhausted instead of cancelling, but also that if it happened again, we could take a rain check so he wasn't forcing himself to come out tired and hungover.

771,{FA} I don't know how to show love or emotion and people call me crazy,"I'm really glad I found this space, because I've felt alone in this.

This has affected me for my entire life. M/25 and have never had a girlfriend. Never held a girl's hand before. Never kissed someone on the cheek. Have not made new friends in 15 years. 

I am regularly an outgoing person and can mask my anxiety with comedy, but whenever something starts to move into relationship territory I push them away. I can be ""mean"" to people and it sucks. Not mean in that sense, but am perceived as prudish and mean because I act reserved.

I physically cannot ask someone out on a date. I can't even bring myself to talk about other relationships in conversation. Yet I have no problem having long conversations with other women, but I never allow it to progress into anything beyond friendship.

I've regretted living on the sidelines and have felt alone with my problem, but I literally don't know how to express feelings of love even though I feel love on the inside. It confuses so many women around me who feel I hate them or reject them because I find it impossible to properly express emotion.

I've been tested for autism and I don't have it. I was researching that avoidant personality can come from childhood. I won't blame my parents, but we grew up in a strict Irish Catholic household that suppressed emotion and love. Parents never told me they loved me. My parents wouldn't dare speak to us about relationships or dating or even let us out of the house.

With all of this I find it easier just to avoid meeting new people all together, because I know it always ends in my hurting them and hurting myself, in a self destructive manner. I'm an extremely unstable person and I long for stability and love in my life. I'm tired of hurting other women.",t176jy,18,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/t176jy/fa_i_dont_know_how_to_show_love_or_emotion_and/,AvoidantAttachment,0
772,How do you discern deactivation vs. not seeing a future? {da},"Hey all!

Was with my ex for over a year and dumped him 4x. Each time it’s because I didn’t see a future, despite him treating me very well. Regardless of this, I always get this on off feeling of not seeing a future even though I love him. He truly gets me and supports me even when I deactivate.

I can’t figure out the reason why I don’t see a future (although I can critique small things like his driving, etc.). It’s been 2 months since I ended the relationship most recently (and I blindsided him after we got pretty close in December - I had him spend a lot of time with my family and it went very well).

773,DA to oversharer — where is the line?,"As a DA, you feel like you can never tell anyone too much about you — that gives them power over you and vulnerability is the enemy. But I’ve had a transformation of sorts lately — both with drastic changes in my life and needing to release control of everything and I’ve been getting a lot of acupuncture and it’s really been helping. And now I can’t stop talking and opening up.

Examples: 
• I’m getting Botox next week and I’ve told my colleagues in an effort to find the best approach and I genuinely don’t care what they think. 
• I work in healthcare and am getting acupuncture and I don’t care that it goes against our medical model and I don’t mind speaking about my experiences of it, even if my colleagues might not agree with it or not believe in it. 
• I’m telling people things I think as I’m thinking them instead of holding onto them and letting them fester. 
• I’m expressing emotions as they come up rather than trying to suppress them. 
• i willingly and without hesitation talk about traumatic experiences that relate to the topic at hand. 
• I willingly talk about my past (good and bad) without filtering it all through a lens of positivity.

Nine of these things I regret. I do it as an attempt to get close to the people around me and share experiences and discussion.

I’d almost think I swung the other way and become an anxiously attached oversharer desperate for validation, reassurance and a need to contribute. 

But I think I may have just snapped into secure attachment as I have no negativity bias of myself or other people. I’m still the same confident, independent person I was but I also don’t care about getting to close to people or telling people too much.

Thought I would ask for some perspective from other self-aware avoidant attachers.",s5q09j,19,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s5q09j/da_to_oversharer_where_is_the_line/,AvoidantAttachment,0
774,I (DA) had and off gut feelings about not seeing a future with my ex,"Title says it all. I had been with my ex for over a year and we had an at times rocky (likely due to my deactivation) but overall great relationship. The first 4-5 months we dated I broke up with him 3 times when deactivating, only to get back together when I stopped deactivating and realized how much I missed/cared about him. When breaking up, each time I told him I didn’t see a future with him and couldn’t give him what he needed. Throughout it all he has been incredibly understanding of my deactivating/needing space and I have really tried to improve throughout our relationship. 

Over the last 8 or so months, we’ve been together. I’ve definitely deactivated at times over this period, but never broke up or ended things because he’s the first person I’ve ever loved and he’s given me space as I’ve needed it. I realize throughout the relationship I’ve been highly critical of him for trivial things (e.g. his driving, inability to properly use a kitchen knife, etc.) which he has pointed out. Regardless of this, he still has been very understanding of me/my attachment style, which has been both scary but also great. 

Anyways, we had an amazing time over the holidays (he stayed with my family for thanksgiving) and after this felt closer than ever. Fast forwarding to present, we spent 7 straight days together after Christmas and had an overall great time. After this period, I believe I extremely deactivated and the morning after he left I sat down, thought/planned out my 2022, and felt these feelings of not seeing a future with him. I (impulsively, admittedly) broke up with him and told him I didn’t see us buying a home or having kids together, and that this wasn’t about a lack of love. Needless to say he was shocked and thrown off by me suddenly ending things. Since then, I’ve completely compartmentalized my emotions toward him. He’s pointed out my attachment and commitment issues and told me he loves me to death but that I need to work on them. This is the 4th time I’ve pushed him away because of this feeling of not seeing a future, and I have no reasons as to why I don’t see us having kids together or buying a home together. 

Fellow avoidants - can you help me understand? This guy loved me to death and treated me like gold even though I’ve hurt him multiple times. There were many times (even, recent) where I have seen a future with him, but this gut feeling ends up hitting me and makes me either deactivate or end things. I’m 30, have had multiple relationships, and have never been able to move in with/progress with a long term partner. It’s like I can’t even trust my own gut.",s3p94n,19,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s3p94n/i_da_had_and_off_gut_feelings_about_not_seeing_a/,AvoidantAttachment,0
775,Ask Avoidants FAQ,"Hello, I will be posting a series of questions that avoidant attachers get asked frequently, but in these posts, I will cut all the context and get straight to the question. These are not my personal questions (although I am curious about the answers to some.) 

**I’m looking for Avoidant attachers to answer for themselves, not for their exes or partners.** For example, “I’m DA and I've done that, and this is why.” Not “My FA/DA ex did XYZ…” (There’s no shortage of others telling us who we are, here we can set the record straight about our own diverse personal experiences as people with an avoidant attachment style.) I’m looking for introspection, and not copy/paste textbook definitions or articles that anyone can access with a quick google search. There are no right or wrong answers when you're speaking from personal experience. 

This will be a **JUDGMENT FREE ZONE**, where Avoidants can answer these questions open and honestly. **There will be zero tolerance for attacks, shaming, lecturing, or therapizing the people answering the questions.** I know the relationship threads and can be overwhelming and triggering, as can frequent relationship posts, many times because they are riddled with high emotion and excessive context. Here, we can simply answer the question and share without interrogation or fear of bashing and shaming.  

I’ll likely compile all these questions/posts into the existing FAQ or a new one, not sure yet. 

If you have a primary attachment style but lean heavily one way or another and it’s not reflected in your flair, please include that in your answer so we know who is saying what and see if there are any similarities or major differences. Please also make sure you have a user flair or at least include your attachment style in your answer if you're not sure how to add it.

If this post is crossposted, please comment on the OP so that we have all the answers in one place.

776,DBT Skills Series: Willingness vs Willfulness,"Willingness vs Willfulness is a Distress Tolerance DBT skill, and pairs really well with Radical Acceptance. It is meant to help deal with intense negative emotions in the moment.  In DBT, *willingness* means recognizing the current reality and problem solving effectively. It's the opposite of fighting the reality around you. 

We often see popular culture promoting the idea of sheer grit and willpower. The idea is that if you are failing at your task, you just need to try harder, accept nothing less than your desired goal. In DBT this is referred to as *willfulness* \- a limited way of looking at the problem. 

In every day life, there are always things that we can't change, or aren't worth trying to change. We need to be able to recognize these situations and be more flexible in our problem solving. This skill is meant to help you practice *willingness* and will help you find creative solutions to problem solve.  

#### *Step One: Describe the Situation

First, describe the problem. Try to state the facts as objectively as possible - what happened, when it happened, who was involved and what is the problem that you are experiencing. Don't worry about your thoughts or feelings about the situation. This step by itself, will help you start seeing the situation in a way where you *willingly* are going to be able to solve it (instead of willfully, i.e. by fighting and resisting the situation).

*Example: ""I got into a fight with my mom on Christmas. It happened after dinner at her house. She told me I was selfish, and now we aren't speaking.""* 

#### *Step Two: How Are You Willful About this Situation

Describe your emotions, your thoughts and your physical sensations. These reflect how you are resisting the situation and how you don't want to accept what has happened. Next, write the result from this way of solving the situation - what you want to do.

*Example: ""I felt really hurt and angry that my mom would say that to me. I could feel my body tense up and my face get red. I can't believe my mom would say something so mean on Christmas day, and in front of everyone! She always invalidates me and ruins every interaction we have. It makes me not want to be around her or any family!*

*I want to reach out to her and tell her how I really feel so she can hurt just like I do.""*

\*This way of solving the problem clearly is not the best solution as it will increase the tension. Having a heated argument will most likely not result with positive effects.

#### *Step Three: What Are You Willing To Do

We'll look at the alternative strategy of *willingness*. If you radically accepted the facts of the situation, how would you feel? What would your thoughts be? What would you then be willing to do? Is there a different, more flexible solution as opposed to spending unnecessary energy resisting the unchangeable facts? Take your time and think about it.

*Example: ""If I accept that I cannot change what my mother said, I would probably still feel hurt. I would be curious about her motivation in saying I was selfish, especially on an important day. I would want to know what I had done or said to make her feel that way. I would reach out to her when I am calm and ask if we can talk about what happened. I would actively listen to her side of things, and try to convey my feelings in an effective way so that we can resolve things and move forward. If we aren't able to come to a resolution, I would need to set some boundaries in our relationship going forward, like walking away if she says something hurtful.""*

The difference between willfulness and willingness may be abstract and hard to understand initially. Willfulness comes from a place of high emotions, while willfulness comes from a place of acceptance and curiosity. Take your time and run through the exercise with some past situations; try to see how this can be applied to every day interactions. You may find that you are spending a lot of time refusing to accept situations in your life that can't be changed. Use this awareness to try to substitute this attitude with the more liberating one - willingness.

I advocate so much for the use of healthy and effective communication, and that went out the window as soon as I was triggered. 

I also feel like it being on the internet didn't help. I'd never let it carry on as long as I did in person. I probably wouldn't even bother at all in person. I suppose at the very least it shows me an area that I still need a lot of work in.

779,Do avoidants come back?,"How do avoidant attachment people deal with break up? Do they ever come back? If they are the one who initiated the break up.

Edit: Context

 I met this guy in university and we quickly became good friends and more than that. He said 'let's be best friends' and none of our friends knew about our relationship - ever - We had all components of a relationship without him ever defining it. I was okay with it because by nature I'm not a needy person. There was zero romance and no intimacy, but I adapted to him. Sometimes it bothered me, but I told myself I should love him as he is and not force anything he isnt comfortable doing (holding hands, expressing love etc). Then we were in a long distance relationship during 3 years (because of covid). I was the one who told him let's get married and he said yeah, he was shy about it in the beginning but after a while, he started to talk about wedding preparation. We were basically waiting for the borders to open to meet each other and get married. Then suddenly he became very engrossed in his work, family issues, he didn't call me for months, even the texting became rare, I confronted him. I said let's fix this distance between us. He plainly said he can't do anything about it. I became so frustrated, i let out all of my anger, uncontrollable . He broke up with me. I was devastated. I felt so so so so worthless. I was never a needy person, I only wanted a bit of his time and attention (only once per week of call for one hour - that's all I needed. And at least text me good morning and good night ) I offered everything I had - my time, support, EVERYTHING - I felt totally drained when he broke up with me. Over text. One sentence. I couldnt comprehend. I did beg him back, and regretted. Because he simply copy pasted his break up text and resent me lol. I am far from being perfect, I do have some extent of anxious attachment but MOST of time, I give him his space, his time. While I never had any of my own needs met. When I wanted a bit of reassurance and affection, I didn't receive it even after asking for it. I guess that's also not healthy, I should voiced out my needs a long time ago, and we probably would have broken up a long time ago instead of wasting 7 years +. Anyway, I do have a LOT of guilt, because of his messages insinuating that I am the one who messed up. I am working on not blaming myself anymore, of letting go of my attachment for him and to secretly stop hoping he comes back. Because the truth is, we're simply not compatible.",ph3g61,20,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ph3g61/do_avoidants_come_back/,AvoidantAttachment,0
780,Avoidants and the closure talk after a BU,"Recently went through a breakup, it’s been 2 months since she left. She hasn’t been the best at showing her feelings and tends to suppress them. She blindsided me, and after 2 and a half weeks of texting and talking here and there we did no contact. I told her I’d still like to have a closure talk when she’s ready. But, after more time passed she said she doesn’t want to have that talk and just wants to move forward. That’s hard for me, cause there’s still a lot I wanted to talk about in order to get my peace and move forward. Granted, I know she doesn’t owe me anything since she left. But doesn’t mean it’s any easier. 

So my question is do avoidants tend to just breakup and feel there’s no need to give the other person closure? Do they tend to not want to give closure because a closure talk implies sometimes vulnerability, emotions, and talking about uncomfortable topics? Or is it just because you’re over it and just don’t care enough to give that talk to the other person?",oi6mct,19,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/oi6mct/avoidants_and_the_closure_talk_after_a_bu/,AvoidantAttachment,0
781,Repeated cycle of breaking up and getting back together.,"
I've (M28) always had an insecure attachment style but after being cheated on 6 years ago I have become fearfully avoident in my relationships (ive had two since becoming FA).

There's this pattern in my past 2 relationships. With both partners I have had trouble complimenting them, difficulties wanting to get to know their parents, shutting down when our future together gets brought up, and generally just feeling like in the back of my mind that I don't want to marry them. 

When marriage gets brought up, or the prospect of moving together and the decision to one of those choices feels like it becomes inevitable, I shut down on my partner. I start slowly pulling away and the next thing I know I start to feel uncomfortable around them. Their compliments make me feel triggered or something and I start getting plagued with doubts or fears that I will forever feel an anxiety from their presence and so it's better just to break it off now than to drag it along or fool myself that it's something it isn't.

After several weeks/months of feeling deactivated with my previous partner I broke up with her only to initiate getting back together a month later then breaking up again with her 4 months later before moving states for work. 

This time around I have to move states due to a family emergency and once again I have broken up with a girl only to get back together with her only to feel like I want to break up again.

I feel like a piece of shit person for being this way. Its hurtful and toxic to my last two partners and I truly want to change. 

How do I distinguish whether or not I'm making the right decision?

Any other questions or advice is welcome.

785,"Flipped back into insecure, anxious mode {FA}","I (27F) feel like the last year and a half I’ve leaned pretty avoidant. Haven’t had feelings for anyone, no real romantic attachment to anyone, generally have felt like I’m not the problem, general lack of emotion. Barely ever cried. 

But the past month I feel like I’ve flipped into anxious mode. It feels like all my negative core beliefs have come flooding back to the surface. I’m ruminating all the time about how I feel worthless and unloveable and not good enough, and feel convinced that no-one will ever love me or properly value me. When a few months ago all that felt inaccessible and I would’ve denied all those beliefs. 

My mind is just replaying all my experiences of being flat out abused in relationships, or mistreated, or of all the guys who have just used me for sex and really not cared about me beyond that (unfortunately a majority of the guys I’ve dated). And then that makes me think back to how I was never good enough for my mum, and my dad has never prioritised me or really been there for me. 

And that then just feeds into this feeling that there must be something fundamentally wrong with me and that I really am unloveable and worthless. 

I think there are possibly lots of things feeding into this at the moment. I’m feeling neglected and quite uncared for by a partner I’m casually involved with. And just other recent experiences of feeling like guys are only into me sexually, and not into me beyond that. It feels degrading. 

I think it being cold and dark all the time probably doesn’t help either. 

Idk I’m just so much more focused on these negative things. I cry quite a lot including when I go for walks or commute. I know I’m viewing everything through a particularly negative lens right now but that doesn’t change the fact that it feels real and these beliefs feel true. 

I just see all my friends in serious meaningful relationships and it hits home that no-one has ever loved me romantically. I’ve never had anything serious with anyone. No one has ever prioritised me or wanted to spend lots of time with me. And then that makes me feel pretty hopeless and like I just don’t really want to be here. Which is a way I haven’t felt in about three years. 

This is just a vent post I guess. But it’s just scary how as an FA it feels like the fundamental way I experience relationships and emotions and how I view myself can flip so suddenly. Idk how long this phase is going to last. I wish I could just go back to feeling emotionally repressed and unattached.

786,Sibling relationships? {FA},"I'm really curious to hear about people's sibling relationships, because I've been grappling with mine really hard and kind of for the first time lately.

My sister has always been my rock, and we've always been close. We didn't really ever fight, not much or not for long. We make each other laugh all the time, etc. But a few things:

&#x200B;

1. Admittedly, I've been realizing how uncool it was for her to be ""my rock"" all through childhood, because I didn't have a good relationship with either parent (and we didn't have a lot of extended family/friends around either... pretty isolated.) I've overly relied on her forever... she's been my guide, mentor, therapist, social worker... I mean that makes it sound extreme but basically I seem to always ""feel lost"" and she's always like trying to help me out. But also, even though that's been the dynamic, I'm *anxious and scared* everytime I need or want help from her, because she's so mean about it. So I've been really sitting with that. Over the past couple of years cutting back on asking for advice, etc. But it's come with all these other things too...
2. She also very much willingly *identified* as the fixer, at the same time that she resented it. She completely takes on an authority role. She's the authority, expert, judge, professor, etc. toward me. This means she's kind of also always been my *bully* in addition to my rock. She puts me down, shames me, judges me harshly, ridicules me, rolls her eyes, tears apart my mistakes, etc. If any of my mistakes (or perceived mistakes) ever have anything to do with her life... she will eviscerate me. Full character annihilation. Comparing me to others to demonstrate how socially inept I am. Unending harshness that she only gives to me and my mom.
3. All of the above means we have a one-way relationship. She influences me *heavily*, and I don't have any influence on her (I'm sure I have an *effect*, but not an influence.) She doesn't turn to me for advice or input ever, despite me actually being very smart and knowledgeable about plenty of things. She doesn't really talk to me about problems at all. She isn't vulnerable with me (though this is just starting to shift as I'm changing.) I actually don't really go into any of my most deeply held interests or beliefs, or talk openly about my most treasured experiences etc. with her. That's a new revelation. It's probably to protect what I hold most dear from her incisive criticisms.
4. All of that means, fundamentally, we don't really know each other that well. This is making me really sad and I want to turn this around and become better friends to each other. It seems possible with her in ways it has not been possible to improve things with my parents.
5. I've already taken some steps: I have like I said worked on relying on her less. I've asked her if she struggles to show warmth to me and she actually broke down about it. I asked her if there's anything she comes to me for, knows I'm the source for, and I think it made her realize that she's been closed to that idea. I have ideas on what I need to keep doing including continuing to rely on her less, but also displaying competence, talking more openly about what matters to me, inviting her vulnerability, and perhaps what feels most important to start with—setting some *very clear* boundaries around ridicule, judgment, and general harshness and cruelty. That has to exit our dynamic immediately.

Anyone else have siblings that play into their attachment stuff? Whenever I test myself, I'm 100% DA towards my parents, and I'm starting to wonder if the FA part of me comes from having that dynamic with them but then essentially being overly dependent and.... sorta AP? ... with my super harsh but also incredibly intelligent and strong sister.",yrukqr,18,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/yrukqr/sibling_relationships_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
787,{FA} Deactivation when it comes,"After realising I’ve always had some issues with relationships I’ve finally recognised but more importantly accepted my patterns as being FA. A very recent breakup shook me up hard with the deactivation coming fast. For others, does the rate at how you deactivate change depending on how much you care about the other person? I went from thinking they were the one to absolutely nothing. I slowly realised I had done this with almost everyone I dated but to varying degrees. However with some I’d convinced it was me never being that into them. I did find that I managed to stay in it longer with them. Is that weird? At the back of my head I always think that my ‘losing interest’ will almost always come.

788,{FA} Always either avoidant or anxious in relationships. When will I know if I am ready to date ?,"Being on most of the attachment theory subs, I know if an anxious moves towards feeling avoidant and vice versa, they have enough evidence that the work they put in has put them onto a path of healing. I hate that I won't have a clear evidence because based on my history, I will go from one extreme of being anxious to completely avoidant.

I want to understand when I will know that I am in the middle of both extremes. Is it a specific amount of time or is it a particular feeling I should wait for ?

I was the anxious one in a classic avoidant-anxious relationship. Most of the attachment quizzes give me a result of equal parts secure, anxious and avoidant i.e. I think I am FA. Because my Ex was a DA, I skewed heavily towards being anxious with him. I was blindsided via text one day when I felt like we had been getting closer to putting a label on it. He moved on pretty quickly with a rebound that did not work out as he expected and circled back to me. By this time, I was heavily researching about attachment theory and knew letting him back into my life would only end in more heartbreak.

We were never in no-contact until I pushed for it. I noticed we always had a push-pull dynamic even over text. The roles of who did the pushing and pulling would switch between us and the other party always responded as expected in this dynamic. He never initiated a text on his own but would always reply and begin this familiar dance.

It's been a few weeks since I had to beg him to block me because I tend to impulsively text him when I am feeling low and want cuddles. It took me a while to convince him that my ADHD makes me do things that I regret and have to start backtracking few hours later.

Case in point was the day we wasted by squabbling over text after I had finished reading Logan Ury's book on finding love on dating apps. I had impulsively texted him one morning because I wanted us to try again. To me, it felt like I had a better idea of the mistakes both of us made. After a while, I realized it was a fantasy that would never be fulfilled because he hated the categorization of being a DA i.e. I started to backtrack. I pushed him to take an attachment theory quiz which labeled him as a DA. Thankfully, he agreed blocking me is best for both of us late at night mainly because I refused to give up. Since then, I have been feeling numb.

Even when I know he is bad news for me, I have started to miss the intimacy & physical touch with him but do not feel like I am emotionally available to meet anyone new at a deeper level. I tried to go out on a search for a FWB like arrangement with someone on the dating apps. But when I chat with men on dating apps, I no longer feel the initial excitement to get to know someone who does check all of my 'initial compatibility' boxes.

I know I should 'date myself' as is often said when an anxious person asks for advice here. I do plan on using a DBT workbook after my order is delivered this week. I am a bit scared that I will become too comfortable being on my own and never venture out again. I know I will do this because on my own I become completely avoidant and self-sufficient to a point that I avoid all social interactions.",x087ct,17,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/x087ct/fa_always_either_avoidant_or_anxious_in/,AvoidantAttachment,0
789,{fa} {da} does anybody else avoid saving numbers?,"I’ve caught myself doing this the last few years and it’s SO stupid and clearly a sneaky little distancing strategy, but I’m curious to hear if anybody else does it or if I’m alone in this 😅

In dating situations, I don’t save numbers for a long time - sometimes for months. For some reason it just feels way too serious and committed. And even when I finally do, I find myself leaving their “last name” as the app I met them on, even once I know out their last name.

I’ve been thinking about it because I was on a date with somebody the other night and happened to see that he had my contact saved. My knee-jerk reaction was “!!!! Why does he have my number saved! He’s taking this too seriously!”

Of course he has my number saved. That’s an incredibly normal thing to do.

Meanwhile, I know I’d feel terrible if they saw my phone and noticed I didn’t have their number saved or as “_______ Bumble”",wv60ni,18,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wv60ni/fa_da_does_anybody_else_avoid_saving_numbers/,AvoidantAttachment,0
790,Entitlement as an avoidant {FA},"One definition of entitlement is  ""belief that one is deserving of or entitled to certain privileges."" 

Is anyone willing to share their experience of entitlement as an avoidant? Do you feel entitled to anything? Do you get the ick when others feel/act entitled? 

There are some personal scenarios that have made me think of this topic. Mainly that I've had multiple people who I infrequently see or talk to that have asked for pictures of my house. My immediate thought was ""Why do these people feel entitled to see my personal space? Is this normal? Or am I just being avoidant again?"" 

I also feel like one of the biggest reasons I struggle with APs is the sense of entitlement. Mainly when they fire off about not being allowed to participate unrestricted in our sub. I don't understand why they feel entitled to do so. If the anxiousattachment sub banned participation from avoidants, I would totally understand that and respect it. Because it's not a space meant for me in the first place. And there are other spaces (attachment\_theory, becomingsecure, attachmentfreestyle) that are meant for all the attachment styles to come together. 

Anyway, I guess I'm just trying to see how other avoidants feel and relate to the sense of entitlement in others because this may highlight another area of growth for myself.",wh3g8y,17,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wh3g8y/entitlement_as_an_avoidant_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
791,{fa}How can I learn to trust people more and be more open in my relationships?,"Please, help me. I started seeing this guy and I already feel like I'm fucking it up by being so emotionally closed. We're just getting to know each other (nothing serious for the moment), but I really like him as a person. I could see things going further than fwb (if he was okay with that too). 

The problem is, I'm really hermetic when talking about my feelings. Or fears. Or passions. It sounds weird, but I'm super reserved. Not that much when I'm talking with friends, but a lot when talking with people I don't know much. Even if deep down I feel like they're trustworthy. I'm just not used to talking about my emotions, problems and the kind of stuff that's necessary to get to know someone for real. What can I do? I really don't want to fuck this situationship up. 

What can I do to let people to know me? I'm really scared of him losing interest in me because of me being this reserved. Another problem is that I don't even know how to put into words my emotions and fears and stuff like that. I can think about it on my own, but when I'm directly asked about it, it's as if I forgot how to talk lol. I know this is because I fear intimacy and because I've never really been this vulnerable with anyone. But I want to change that. 

Please, how can I be more open?


Edit: It's funny how when we first started talking I had the urge of stopping communication with him every time he showed any kind of interest in me. And now, here I am freaking out about him inevitably losing interest. The irony. At the beginning I was so proud of me for not running away from potentially having something with someone interested in me for the first time in my life. And now I'm just frustrated with myself for not being more open and approachable. I know I'm like this due to my insecurities and fear of intimacy, but it sucks so much.",w74aop,18,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/w74aop/fahow_can_i_learn_to_trust_people_more_and_be/,AvoidantAttachment,0

793,{da} Fear of being 'bad' in bed?,"I mostly identify as DA but I definitely have FA tendencies too. Sex has always been a difficult territory to navigate for me, there's things I don't like and would never want in bed (say, performing oral) and I generally need a lot of time to get comfortable with someone. I have only been with people that I had an emotional connection with. 

We often hear people talk about being afraid of not being 'good' in bed. I was seeing someone lately and he ended things 2 weeks ago. For the first time in a long time, I felt that sex felt both very connecting and very physically pleasant, just comfortable and nice. I have wondered how my own fear of not being 'good enough' in bed looks like and I don't seem to have an answer necessarily. For some reason, it felt extra difficult to let go emotionally because our time in bed was so connecting and intimate.

Those of you who identify as women and are heterosexual out here: how does your fear of 'not being good' in bed look like? If you'd put it into words, how would you describe it? I think I've felt way less comfortable in bed in the past, and for the first time now, it felt like I was slightly less inhibited and more explorative. 

I wondered about the whole 'good enough sex' thing though and would love to hear opinions!

794,{fa} At the core of it all there is always a pain so deeply felt I never dare to linger for too long.,"I often return the a metaphorical image of myself as a small child holding a bucket down by the Pacific Ocean desperately trying to empty the ocean. He believes if he can just do that he will feel seen, and loved, and not so scared and lost in this world. I suspect for many insecurely attached people there are layers and layers of defence mechanisms in place much of the time designed not to spend too much time in this place. Yet I feel at its core this is what it’s all about too. Sometimes I think the thing we are most scared of in all this world is letting someone else see that child desperately wanting to feel loved. We recognize we can’t fill the void with other people. And yet the void is there. We understand our own role in the dynamics. There is perhaps an unconscious understanding that no one can fix this for us. And so we run from other people. Because we believe somewhere deep down that it will be less painful to let the child keep desperately work at the impossible task of trying to be loved, to will it into existence.Than to put the bucket down and actually give up the fight, stop trying to be fixed and actually let someone see our wounds and walk hand in hand in pain.  There seems to be truth on the surface of this. But the longer I live and the more I learn to love myself the more I suspect this is deeply wrong.

The child is hurting and we must ""protect them"". Ironically our protection is often the very isolation that continues to hurt them.",vvn1uq,17,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vvn1uq/fa_at_the_core_of_it_all_there_is_always_a_pain/,AvoidantAttachment,0
795,Dealing with severe regret about actions that led to breakup {da}/{fa},"A few months ago I (25F) made a decision that led to my partner (25M) of about 3 years walking away. Without getting into details, I backed out of something major that we had planned, relatively last minute. Understandably, he was extremely hurt and took that as a last straw, and I have not heard from him since then. 

&#x200B;

Leading up to the event, I was going through quite a hard time personally. I knew even in the moment that I was behaving in a self-sabotaging way, because I truly love this man, and he loved me. But in the moment I was incapable of getting out of my head and making what I knew to be the best choice for myself. 

&#x200B;

Since then, I've been dealing with extreme amounts of regret and shame for the pain I caused him as well as the relationship that I ruined. I've been doing a lot of deliberate work on myself to understand the root of what happened and to make sure I don't act like ever again. I have apologized several times but have been met with silence. I wish more than anything that we could try again in our relationship (several major circumstances have changed in our favor since then), but it seems that what I did was unforgivable. I wish more than anything that I could show him this new version of me and that I could have a chance to finally be the partner he deserves.

&#x200B;

I have been trying to move on from the guilt and regret but it is very difficult. Does anyone have any advice for self-forgiveness? Rationally I know that I only did what I could at the time but I'm having a really hard time truly accepting that in my heart.",vum4ww,18,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vum4ww/dealing_with_severe_regret_about_actions_that_led/,AvoidantAttachment,0

797,I don’t know how to give anyone a chance {FA},"I feel like I’m (27F) leaning very avoidant currently. I’ve always tended to use dating apps to meet people. But every time I’ve tried in the past four months or so I just can’t bring myself to give anyone a chance. 

Everyone gives me an immediate ick. I can’t be bothered to sustain any conversation. I feel like everyone is so boring and I’m tired of having the same old generic conversations for the hundredth time (I’ve used dating apps on and off for the past 6 years). And it’s tiring putting in effort to talk to people, only to give them benefit of the doubt and give them a chance and meet up and know within the first minute that I’m not attracted to them. And to then have to go through the motions of the date and the awkwardness of rejecting them. Or to maybe like them initially but then get the ick very quickly. 

I want to date and find someone I click with. But all I feel is disgust at the moment. I don’t understand some other friends who seem to constantly be into new people they’re dating and so excited about it and attached etc. I just feel nothing (best case scenario) or disgust. 

It’s not that I’m burnt out, because I haven’t dated anyone properly in 6 months (and haven’t gone on any dates whatsoever in 4+ months). 

Any tips for getting past this? In the past I wasn’t like this at all. I was enthusiastic and motivated. Idk if it’s just a case of waiting until it passes. Or whether there’s something I could be doing to increase my chances of connecting with anyone?",vn92qk,19,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vn92qk/i_dont_know_how_to_give_anyone_a_chance_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0

It sucks because I was really looking forward to living with him (we had already been on  long trips together and it felt like our lifestyles were meant to be), but now that I have to deal with cohabitation and a huge workload at the same time, I feel extremely overwhelmed. It feels like I'm deactivating and every inch of my body wants to flee. I'm becoming hypercritical of everything he says and does, even though he's extremely caring and has already told me plenty of times that he could give me space if I needed to. I hate being like this. I wish I could just accept sharing my personal space like other normal human beings and I hate that I'm so b\*tchy and critical about him. At this point I'm just expecting him to be done and leave, and while it would probably relieve me to be alone again I'd hate losing him forever.

799,"Cohabitation, parallel activity, transitions {FA}","Does anyone else here actually tend to do better with cohabitation? I haven't lived with a partner for six years (lived alone), and it's been really hard on me not making it to that point with anyone. I'm on the brink of moving in with my current partner now and I'm *so excited*. 

I've most often moved in with partners pretty fast, which seems not avoidant-y but I actually think that for me it kind of is. I know ""we avoidants"" do better with more *parallel* activity - like, I can be on the couch reading a book while he's in the kitchen starting dinner, say things to each other here and there and have a kiss, flowing in and out of contact... as opposed to the kind of hyper-engaged, eye-contact, ""*we're together right now so we are hanging ou*t"" kind of thing that comes with dating pre-cohabitation. 

I'm actually really, really struggling with this phase... we might be moving in together in a month or two and honestly that feels like too long to keep going this way, I'm tired of the constant transitioning of together-apart and my house-his house. Exhausting. 

I'm realizing that as we've both moved toward secure individually, and also done so together, that instead of transitions all feeling easier and easier, they're kind of just all feeling difficult. When I have been in my more DA phases I have the classic separation-elation and reunion-anxiety pretty solidly. Now I'm finding that I have just kind of a hard time separating *and* coming together, it's the transition itself that's taxing, which feels way more FA. I would love if I could make it to a place where transitions are easier, but I'm not totally sure that's on the docket for me.

800,{fa} - Healing Isn't Linear,"FA leaning dismissive here (actually well on my way to becoming more secure), and I'm feeling angry. The key word here is '*feel*' because I wasn't aware of just how angry I was until now. My boundaries were consistently violated/trampled on, and I feel ashamed because I couldn't stand my ground. In addition, I feel *incredibly* misunderstood. 

I was actively repressing all these feelings because of my fear of conflict and people pleasing tendencies.

The situation at hand: A few weeks ago I was at a friends festival where I know mostly everyone there. At the time, I was dating someone.

When I was there, I met someone who I'd been interested in last year at another festival we'd both been to. He hit on me, and I was very direct and told him that although I was into him last year, I am currently dating someone and am not interested in pursuing anything else at the moment. He respected that, and we hung out a bit at the festival as friends. I felt that because I was clear, he wouldn't make a move. He didn't, but then proceeded to add me on social media.

He texted me a bit after the festival and I again, had to be clear on where I stood, which already annoyed me because I don’t like repeating myself. And then a bit after, he wanted to meet up. I told him I felt it was inappropriate. He said he understood and insisted we stay on friendly terms and chat once in a while. I said okay, because I knew him, and I knew we'd meet frequently at mutual friends events- In short, I didn't want to come across as rude. I wanted to *avoid* *conflict.*

This person found out that me and the person I had been dating had broken up. He has been *incredibly* persistent since then, and I have been very emotional because of said break up (first time feeling all the feelings but perhaps I'll write a separate post on that) and less direct.

By less direct, I mean I *reply*. I don't initiate, and I've stated *multiple times* that I don't wish to meet or sometimes even talk. I have also asked for space, a request that has been ignored. Every time I say 'I cant talk right now/Not in the mood to chat/I need space/I don’t want to meet up anytime soon' it has been completely disregarded and he carries on the conversation after saying he 'understands'. If he understood, he wouldn’t continue the conversation. If he understood, I wouldn’t have to repeat myself.

Inevitably, I started to low-key enjoy some of the attention I was getting – because honestly, after a shitty breakup,  it felt like a nice distraction, and the validation felt like a relief from some of the feelings of rejection I'd been processing.

Normally, I would have blocked this person a long time ago. But I fear conflict with people in my inner circles. I feared meeting him at future events/festivals/parties/gatherings. I was afraid of disappointing him. I was also worried I was making a big deal out of nothing.

So I ignored my needs and my inner voice telling me to tell him to fuck right off. My shitty state of mind made that easier than usual.

Unfortunately I had to fall from grace and *agree* to meet up on friendly terms in order to realize just *how* fucking angry I was.

We met up (nothing romantic happened) and I decided to share with him that I felt that he was disrespecting my need for space and boundaries. 

Honestly, I felt pretty stupid bringing it up at all, as I was at his house, sipping on a glass of wine. Who does that? 

He said he had felt that I was interested at the festival a few weeks ago, and said that I had made it sound like it wasn’t serious between me and the person I'd been seeing (I think he has selective hearing/memory because I literally told him it was probably the best and most healthy relationship I've had in my life, and that I was fully committed to it a few times) and that I had been replying consistently to him and been flirty. He did apologize to me for crossing my boundaries, but he basically said I wasn’t clear enough. 

What was I supposed to do, argue with how he felt I was coming across? I felt incredibly misunderstood, and I didn’t know what to say without completely losing my shit.

I also felt very disconnected from my feelings and like I didn’t actually know what I thought or felt while we were talking about it.

Days later I was still processing, still considering that perhaps I was exaggerating until yesterday – when he sent me a screenshot of a mutual friend reacting or replying to an insta story of his. He had mentioned she was interested in him a while back and I told him she was really great - he said she wasn't his type, but left it at that. I had questioned why he'd mention it then if that was the case, but to be honest - I didn't care enough to pursue an actual answer. I was in a shitty mind state of my own, and dismissed it.

But this time, he sent me the screenshot and said 'Is this gossip not okay?' with a smiley emoji, as if she had done something embarrassing. As if this was somehow funny. He's 37 years old, by the way. Not that this behavior is any less disgusting at a younger age but... c'mon. You're going on 40 and sending screenshots of women hitting on you as if you're above them?

I was disgusted. 

I told him that it was inappropriate/unnecessary, that she was a great girl, and that he was being rude/mean.

He apologized, but I'm over it.

And now I'm angry at myself. I'm angry that I haven’t been trusting my intuition, have been ignoring red flags and been disconnected from myself. That it took me this long. That it took him disrespecting *someone else* for me to realize that this wasn't okay. In other words, I don't respect myself in a sense for putting up with this shit, but I clearly respect someone else who has no idea she's being regarded so poorly.

I'm having a lot of trouble coming to terms with the fact that I've done so much work on self improvement and still completely fallen through the cracks. In regards to the entire situation between me and him, I feel like no matter how much I communicated and how direct I was, it wasn't enough. 

And this is where *self-forgiveness* comes into play.

First off, I shouldn't feel so ashamed about wanting to tell him to fuck off. He deserves it.

I will not tell him to fuck off, because we have so many mutual friends and I will see him often, but I will definitely end this 'friendship'.

I shouldn't blame myself and judge myself so harshly. We're all healing, and healing isn't linear. There will always be ups and downs, and times where we are disconnected.

So although now I can feel and connect to all these terrible feelings - I can finally *connect* to myself - and that's a relief!

My needs and boundaries are valid. The people who I want in my life will respect them.

I am no longer going to rationalize avoiding ending whatever this is. So without further adieu ,I'm finally ready to face the music : )",ucblcf,17,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ucblcf/fa_healing_isnt_linear/,AvoidantAttachment,0

803,{fa} Does it ever occur to you that we don't stick around for the healing?,"I could be wrong because I've always ran really early so far in my limited experience. I've only had 2 people where we dated to the point where I could see something developing and I ran at that point. But I'm thinking of this is the context of my frienships elsewhere and how I often feel when I feel I've made a mistake. I think I'm often running from the fear of conflict. We didn't do conflict in my family. It was avoided, swept under the rug etc. Normally if conflict arose we all felt really really horrible after and we didn't get a feeling that it was an OK thing. I've always since felt that when I mess up and show some of my flaws that it triggers this visceral horrible feeling about myself. That is often what I run from. 

But I've had some more recent experiences with friends where I've experienced those feelings and the realization that the friendship continues. Particularly I've had some online friends who have stood up and told me thankfully when I've said things that have bothered them. These are online people where we have supported each other for a number of years, sharing our emotional struggles daily issues etc. Someties heavy stuff and close to the bone. I really value them as friends. And frisnhips built on stuff like this you are bound to have some bad feelings at times. I've been told a number of times when I've step across boundaries, assumed things I should not have, made things all about me, haven't listened to what they are saying, basically upset them and they let me know. I've noticed each time it triggers me fairly deeply, I feel horrible and that I want reassurance that I'm ok, I want them to take it back even though I know 100% I am in the wrong. The thing is that despite messing up in these frinships I notice that we still remain friends. Next day or day after, sooner or later we value talking again. It's interesting to note that my best friend I have doesn't share this quality to our relationship,  he's someone who never judges anything I ever say or do. It strikes me that that's why I gravitated to him as a friend because he was so accepting. This isn't necessarily a healthy thing though. It's not a judgment of either person both types of people are wonderful and I'm better for having both types of friends. Indeed the friends that are willing yo stand up and say, hey that thing you said didn't feel good have helped me grow more. 

It strikes me that I I'm always scared in the dating arena of that point arriving. When I've put my foot in my mouth, shown my humanness and flaws. Was too arrogant, egotistical, sexist in the ways society raises you to inevitably be. I realize too that it's a vital component of relationship for both sides to be able to voice these things of each other and to communicate, heal and work with each other. There is no guarantee of that of course, the other person could easily not accept you as well. It occurs to me that I've never braved sticking around for the bad stuff and the potential healing. I figure it's going to come up eventually, better run before it does. I'm conscious on some level that arguments like this aren't about the nature of my acceptability as a human being but that is where my emotions leap to. It's about how the other person was made to feel and not about my worthiness to be accepted. For me though I walk around in this world almost constantly in fear of having this feeling that I'm worthless, or dangerous, or ""bad"" confirmed by something someone says to me. I think it would likely do me a lot of good to stick things out more often to learn this lesson but I've been stubbornly always running.",u83ssz,18,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/u83ssz/fa_does_it_ever_occur_to_you_that_we_dont_stick/,AvoidantAttachment,0

My romantic/sexual experience is close to nonexistent. I can't help but notice the differences with others experiences and feel bad with myself.

My issue is that other people are my biggest fear. I just can't stand others presence. I get highly activated and that was always my experience. 

There were times I got *very* obsessed with strangers, especially since I suffer from compulsive daydreaming, and I never felt the urge to get the attention and love and affection of potential romantic suitors I know compared to as much I did with those certain distant persons.

But at the same time, as much I strongly desire physical affection and romantic love to the point is what I constantly daydream about, generally I either get irritated or uninterested when someone approaches me irl. And it makes me feel so ashamed.

I try to work through this step by step. It's not easy. I have no one in life that would comprehend these issues so I'm left with no one but myself to work through the mess that is my mind and my feelings. 

I wish so much I was like others. Just starting to date real people around 15, get my own baggage of sexual and romantic experiences with time and become a normal, adjusted and efficient adult with a cohesive and grounded sense of self.

Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my improvement and I'm proud of what I accomplished in life so far.. only that my sense of self is so fragmented and my brain works in a funny way so I also frustrate myself. 

Right now I feel tired. Tired of my life. Tired of feeling chronically alone. Tired of always having problems I can't discuss with the normies. Tired of having to discipline myself. I try so hard but sometimes I think it's not enough.",txoee5,19,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/txoee5/trying_to_recover_my_insecure_attachment_style_by/,AvoidantAttachment,0
806,{fa} I think I've been running from the truth that people actually love me.,"Looking back on the times I've cut and run from situations in the past I can see a common thread is that it came as a huge shock to everyone, or I assume it did in cases where I don't know. 

One example I'm really thinking of is when I got myself into the dorms at a school I was going to. It was the start of my 2nd term and as usual I'd gotten myself in over my head by also choosing to move into the dorms. By this time I'd made some fairly good friends at the school. One night we all went out partying and I got dangerously drunk, came back to the dorms and threw up everywhere had to be carried back to my room lol. Honestly looking back almost kind of a typical party experience from college. I was so embarrassed the next day though and so scared with being in over my head at school that I called my parents, told them to come get my stuff and ran away for the day. I spent the day drinking again and went to watch a movie. My enabling parents did what I always counted on them to do, swooped in an saved the day. I never had to say hi to anyone of my classmates. Slate wiped clean. I'd also unfriened all of them thinking I couldn't face any of them, needed to make a clean break. I carried such an enormous weight of shame with me all the time that no one could be allowed to see. One of them managed to still text me and asked me what happened. I sheepishly explained. One of the things that really stuck me even to now was that he told me that the one thing that bothered most everyone wasn't what I'd done, running away etc etc but was unfriending everyone. 

To be honest my view of myself was so warped that it didn't really occur to me that I'd hurt people's feelings. I thought they were going to be angry at me, hell yes. There goes Thomas again ruining things for those who depend on him. I unfriended them to avoid their wrath. But the idea that I'd hurt them was actually kind of a shock to me. That means that they actually liked me. This idea has come back to me again and again as kind of a shock. I think I often run away from the truth of the mater that many people like and even love me in different ways. Even romantically I can see people  have been smitten by me. And it's weird cause this is EXACTLY what my heart wants. It's THE thing I desire. To be liked, loved, wanted, even lusted after, the whole range of human experience. 

And yet I seem to run from it at the same time. I deny the fact that it's true. I'm terrified as soon as it becomes apparent that it's actually true. I push it away. I think  scared of what it means. The responsibility. I think I've spent a lot of years climbing deep into my head building intellectual catsles, numbing myself. It terrifies me that when it comes to this territory I'm little lost child with no tools. I try my very best to be a ""good"" person in this world. Indeed I think most people often describe me overtly with ideas of kindness and goodness. And yet that's kind of a mask I put on because I so desperately wish to be liked. It's not fake. I don't do good things expecting necessarily a return of payment. I genuinely do them because it's who I am. But it's also because I don't want to be not liked. At a core level when you take off all the armour and speak of being vulnerable on a true one to one level. I think I am terrified that that closeness will break me as much as it may be the very thing that may heal me. So I run. I keep things friendly and surface level. I show interest but dance around the edges. I get close enough to get my toes wet. But no must never take the armour off for you will not survive the encounter.",txf6f5,18,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/txf6f5/fa_i_think_ive_been_running_from_the_truth_that/,AvoidantAttachment,0
807,Art and avoidant attachment {FA},"So I’m an FA, poet, musician, and songwriter. Right now I’m attempting a relationship which is just…so stressful. Since he told me he has feelings for me, I have written next to nothing.

In the past, I felt so much guilt over that, but the more I’ve thought about it, the more I realize that I think it’s because I’m in a state of intense internal shutdown. My reason for not writing isn’t because I’m lazy, it’s because I’m too afraid to think or feel anything, which is a necessary part of the writing process for me.

I feel like I’m stagnating in life in general, and I used to blame it on myself, feeling like I was getting lazy because I knew someone liked me so I don’t have to try anymore. But since then I’ve realized that I’m in such intense survival mode that it’s making a lot of personal development practically impossible…

811,Healthy Relationship Timeline {FA},"So in true FA fashion I jumped on the dating apps to find some instant validation after the recent breakup. Usually I make it 3-4 days before disabling the account because I realize I'm good and don't actually want to meet any of these men. Except this time I matched with someone and really hit it off. 

We've had 3 dates so far in the last 2 weeks. He picks me up, pays, sets up the next date before the current one is over. We talk consistently and he communicates times when he will be unavailable. He is open and seems to be somewhat self aware and able to express emotions. There's some physical attraction, but we haven't even held hands at this point. He is very clearly showing interest and putting forth effort, and knows that he wants a long term committed relationship and what that looks like for him (and it lines up with what I want). 

I don't think I've ever had a man treat me this way. I don't think I've ever had a man not bring sex up within days of mutual interest being expressed. I'm enjoying this, and so far no anxiety or avoidance is being triggered. I'm taking that as a good sign, and even my therapist told me that I seemed to be happier and he could see it in my eyes. 

My question is what a healthy relationship timeline looks like. I tend to move way too fast, and this pace is much slower than I'm used to. This guy admitted that he's actually progressing faster than he ever has before and that he views it as a good thing. 

I can tell that I am starting to have feelings (we've only been talking about 3 weeks but daily and pretty much all day). Nothing too extreme, but when he tells me he'll be quiet for a few hours, I miss him. And I want to message him first thing in the morning. I'm already picturing future things with him (and then consciously reeling those thoughts back in and trying to just focus on the moment). 

I think this is kind of a common thing for insecure attachments. We either tend to move too fast or too slow. So what is a normal, healthy timeline in your opinion?",tbxowx,19,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tbxowx/healthy_relationship_timeline_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
812,How has being avoidant affected your friendships? from a {da},"I've recently started going to therapy and have only started to unpack my avoidant tendencies and how my relationship with my parents has more or less fucked up my ability to be emotionally available in any other relationship. I'm a 21F, and honestly, I can't even start to think about romantic relationships -- the thought of actually dating someone, integrating them into my life, being somewhat dependent on them -- scares the shit out of me. I've mostly just had flings/hookups and honestly that's what I feel comfortable with. No commitment, no emotional vulnerability. They really didn't know anything about who I was as a person.

But I also feel like I'm completely avoidant in my friendships. I'm awful at talking about my emotions, I just let things build and build in my head and drive myself crazy but I don't fell comfortable telling anybody else how I'm feeling unless I'm directly prodded/asked, and even then I can just give a really surface-level explanation of how I feel. I don't feel comfortable talking to my friends, I definitely can't talk to my parents (how we ended up here, obviously), and I only have therapy biweekly. I've dealt with a lot of trauma in the past two years and just having to stew in it instead of being able to talk about it is really fucking up my headspace.

813,Has anyone else become more avoidant over time? {fa},"I’m curious whether any other avoidants (FA or DA) have become more avoidant over time? In my teens and early twenties I was a fairly even mix of anxious and avoidant tendencies in romantic relationships and since then I’ve drifted to a much more avoidant place.

I stayed single for a few years and have recently started dating again. What’s different now is that I seem to be fault finding much earlier in dating somewhere and after a few weeks the anxiety coming up is making me think about getting out already. I would like to work towards being more secure and having a healthy long term relationship. 

I suspect a series of traumatic events and painful relationships/experiences of rejection and abandonment are what has strengthened my avoidant tendencies over time.

815,Update: Today is better,"u/UpcycledThrowayAccnt asked how I was doing another day removed from my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/smq52h/broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_and_its_hell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and my comment started to get long so I figured I'd just make a post.

It's been 4.5 days since I sent the break up text. 2.5 days since I sent a follow up saying silence isn't a scenario I had played out. Yesterday at work we interacted more than usual, and I was able to do it without being triggered. I had a moment in the later afternoon where I felt sad, but I let myself feel it and it passed quickly.

After dinner, I felt an overwhelming urge to send him a text apologizing for my part in our dynamic. I did so not anticipating any kind of response. I had this gut feeling that he was stuck in a shame/guilt cycle, and I just needed him to know that he wasn't the only one at fault. I most definitely brought my own shit into this relationship, kept him at arm's length just as much as he did me (but in different ways), and let me past relationships and trauma come into play. I ended the text by telling him that I would respect his silence moving forward, and it was the last text I would send.

In the last few months, I've gotten into spirituality. There's a TikTok account I follow that the gal has guided meditations. I did one on Monday, and another last night. I felt better and relaxed, and as I was falling asleep he texted me. He said that I wasn't the problem, he is. I replied, but didn't hear back. It just confirmed I was right about the guilt/shame cycle. I've been there so I get it. Sometimes we stand in our own way.

Today I feel light, happy, hopeful. I plan on doing the meditations on a routine basis as I truly attribute them to part of why I feel this way. It was almost an experience akin to EMDR, but more positive throughout the whole thing. I definitely feel as if the universe is leading me down a path of healing the relationship with myself, and I don't think I would have been able to do that while seeing him. Not because he held me back, but because he triggered so much of my old wounds unintentionally. And I let it happen.

I'm going to take the forward momentum and run with it. I had been afraid that if I ended things with him that I would just immediately try to find someone new to fill the void. I have - me. I'm realizing that I'm the only one who will always be there for me. And I need to figure out how to trust myself, how to love myself, how to stop avoiding myself. That's my plan going forward.",sodgqp,18,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/sodgqp/update_today_is_better/,AvoidantAttachment,0

817,Did I overreact? Am I deactivating/ is this a protest strategy or am I just reaching the ends of my limits?,"
I'm (27f) FA, and the guy I'm seeing (29m) DA. We've had off and on situationships for 3.5 years now. We met in July 2018 and dated for a few months where he didn't want to commit to exclusivity or long term (I felt hurt and threatened by that and I think it bred some resentment, but I went along with it because I liked him so much).

It ended after we went on a week long roadtrip together which was amazing (in my eyes), but I think we got too emotionally close so he pulled away. I was also not good at self soothing my attachment anxiety so I dumped too much of it onto him.  We went no contact and completely cut each other out.

Summer 2019 rolls around and he reaches out to rekindle. I'm pretty hesitant because I was still pretty heartbroken and resentful from last time. This time I try to set better boundaries saying that I don't want to date him unless we can both agree to exclusivity and we can call each other boyfriend/girlfriend. He agrees and that helps me feel more secure.

Things are going okay, but he dumps me again while we are at burning man because I asked him if he sees a future with us. He said that he doesn't. I tell him that I am looking to build a long term relationship with someone, so he decides to break up with me because we are looking for different things. Again we go completely no contact but this time for almost two years.

Around March this year DA guy starts creeping back in. It started with him texting me saying that he was dreaming of me. I ignored it but then started having dreams of him too so I messaged him back. I was feeling secure and platonic towards him and it was fun to chat again.

Things started getting messy when he asked for his a couple of his shirts that I had back. I was a bit hesitant to meet up with him, but it was fun and chill. We began hanging out more and more and then I started falling for him again. I tell him about my feelings and he says that he feels the same. He feels like this time it is different, and he is actually looking to build something long term with someone and can see us working out.  This time I was feeling more secure and a lot better at self soothing. Basically the only thing I did during quarantine was to learn about healing CPTSD and attachment trauma. I have been in therapy for 5 years now, but quarantine allowed me to focus on myself. I think he sensed the security and was attracted to that.

We date harmoniously for a few months but I start feeling him deactivate after our first argument a couple months in. I was feeling insecure because he is married for a green card and I was looking for reassurance. We still continue our relationship though and spend lots of time together but things don’t feel the same. He’s less interested in pursuing me and less interested in trying to make the relationship work, but we were still pretty harmonious. 

He actually broke up with me first a few weeks ago. His reason was that he is going away for 5 weeks abroad and we had too many relationship issues to work on. I am devastated because I thought that we were really committed to making things work this time and 5 weeks of not seeing each other in person seemed trivial to me. I feel betrayed. I act anxious after the breakup and push him further into distancing but he asks to see me a week and a half later. 

I go over to his house and he says that he wants to reconsider the breakup and asks if we can “put the breakup on pause”. I am really hurt and confused so I ask for some time to think. I wait for a couple days but he is about to leave so I go over again and say I am willing to try if he is. I feel conflicted about this decision and feel a bit like I’m betraying myself a bit. 

He’s been gone for a week now and the distance is is chilling. He said that he would try, and I told him that I would put the ball in his court to contact me first but the contact has been very minimal. I asked him to text me after he landed so I know he’s okay but I didn’t get a text until a couple days later. I try telling him “I feel worried about us. I feel unloved and unimportant when there’s no check in or call for days.” He expresses that he is still unsure about us and this completely guts me. I tell him that “I would like to simultaneously respect his need for space and my need for connection, but things have been tense. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells afraid to say anything in fear of him bolting again. I feel like I am carrying the responsibility of creating repair and carrying the emotional labor.”

The straw that broke the camels back happened a few hours ago. He finally says that he would call me and I tell him that I am very excited to hear from him. I miss his call but I call him back 4 minutes later. He then says that he is already in bed and he can’t talk because he doesn’t want to wake up his aunt (they aren’t sleeping in the same room but maybe the walls are thin?) I ask him if he can go downstairs to talk and he says that he doesn’t feel like going downstairs because he’s already in bed. I feel triggered by this and upset because I just missed his call by 4 minutes! 4 freaking minutes! It feels so rigid. I have been respecting his space for days and I missed his window by 4 minutes and I feel like I’m being punished. From my perspective since he isn’t willing to walk downstairs to talk to me he doesn’t care about me.

I ask him if he’s willing to text because I am feeling alone. He doesn’t reply even though he’s read my message so I am triggered even more. I tell him that this distance doesn’t feel good to me and this isn’t working for me. I tell him that it seems like he really wants out of the relationship so I’ll let him go. He replies with “ok I hope you have a good Xmas. Reach out in January if you want to talk.” 

I am waffling on my decision now. I’m not sure if it’s a protest behavior or if I really want out. I feel completely emotionally exhausted like I was run over by a bus. I just miss him so damn much. It seems like he’s completely checked out of the relationship anyway so I don’t know if it really matters. We are both intensely triggered by this relationship and I don’t know if either of us are skilled enough to make it work.",rke96l,18,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rke96l/did_i_overreact_am_i_deactivating_is_this_a/,AvoidantAttachment,0

This added to lack of communication triggers my anxious side and well you know how that can go. 

I knew he’d been feeling a little overwhelmed and tired in his life lately and it wasn’t related to the relationship. I asked him what was going on and he said he was tired of everything, explicitly said not of me but just tired and didn’t want to talk to anyone. I tried to give him space however he’d occasionally initiate conversation and when I followed he just left or ignored me. 
I find that to be disrespectful so I told him that I don’t like it. He then said we should stop talking for a while. I overreacted 🤦🏻‍♀️telling him that if he didn’t care about me then I’d better leave and he said ok basically.

I immediately regretted it and told him I was sorry and I said it out of resentment.
He said he understood how his behaviour could make me angry but that it was how he was feeling and that he needed space of everything and “to miss me”. 
That he loves me and it’s not like he doesn’t want to know about me anymore. But that we should stop talking for a while.

It’s been two weeks and we haven’t had contact. He is barely talking to anyone as far as I know and isn’t playing the videogame we used to play everyday (not always together, just we both play it and see the other online.. so I know he’s not been playing). 

Is this usual for DAs to just shut down completely? How long should I expect it to be? And should I avoid texting him or contacting him at all?

Specifically how my dad's own attachment style (most definitely dismissive avoidant) affected how I relate to men in romantic relationships. I see how I have sought out men that recreate the dynamic I had with my dad. My dad used to come home from work and just check out completely. It's like we didn't exist. I also remember being afraid of him.

My current partner is similar in that when we aren't together I very much feel like I don't exist to him. We've been able to talk about it, and I know that's not the case. And he absolutely shows up when I truly need him to. The biggest difference is consistency - he consistently is there. He doesn't go more than 2-3 days without asking to see me. He answers the phone if I call. If I text and need something, he shows up. In person he is very attentive and quite the opposite of my dad. And as I am able to behave more securely, my partner does as well. He is the one who initiated a difficult conversation the other day, and I'm the one who tried to avoid. 

Anyway. It got me wondering. What is one thing you didn't get in childhood that you wish you had?

825,Difference between being having an avoidant attachment and just not being into someone?,"I used to be anxiously attached. But I feel like more recently I relate a lot more to avoidant attachments. I’ve dated quite a bit during the past six months. Have met a few people who wanted to take things to the next stage to become exclusive or enter a relationship. But I haven’t wanted that so ended it. 

I feel like at the moment I value my independence and don’t like the idea of being tied down or someone being overly dependent on me. Clingy ness is a massive turn off. My feelings for someone can change quite quickly (get the ick and feel like they’re not right for me). I generally have a hard time feeling attached to anyone. 

Like I’ve been dating a guy for three months. I like him and like spending time with him and being affectionate etc. But I don’t want to commit to him or feel tied down. 
 
It’s just it feels like a lot of signs of avoidant attachment (e.g. pushing away when things get more serious, keeping emotional distance, not being overly verbal about feelings, finding flaws in them, wanting space and independence rather than commitment) also overlap with just not really being that into someone.

They have mostly always ended because I had issues with physical intimacy, didn't invest in spending as much time together as the other person wanted, and came across as less invested and committed in general. More often than not, my need to take my time before I become physical and the importance that I attach to sex is something that pushes people away, especially because the other person would want more sex than I would be comfortable with. We would end up not having enough physical intimacy and that would affect the other person and make them feel that their needs are unmet. 

Does anyone else recognize themselves in this description? Do you think there is a thing where avoidants enjoy sex less/have a harder time deriving pleasure from it?

I have a very hard time wrapping my head around why the above has become a pattern in my romantic relationships. I have posted before about having questioned whether I was asexual or whether some life events have affected me such that sex is not something I can easily embrace and enjoy.

The last person that I was seeing was unfaithful to me and told me 2 days ago, so I have been consumed by thoughts as to why I function the way I do.

829,Cannot handle AP friends attachment fixation,"Mostly complaining but open for pointers. Also this won't be the prettiest most easily swallowed thing so if you're a lurker spare me the angry comment that will get deleted.

I have an AP friend of almost 8 years who was considered for a BPD diagnosis (but was decided against ultimately, but just to paint a picture of her attachment disturbance levels). She had a really bad childhood (abusive NPD+Bipolar dad and volatile mom-dad relationship) and had a very dysfunctional series of sexual behavior and relationships when I knew her. She was so bad with boundaries and people selection, she let a lot of people use her and degrade her, people treated her horribly. All of her relationships were short lived and abusive. Some of these experiences included rape (which I absolutely do not blame her for) and BDSM with questionable consent, unprotected sex (multiple times), unconsented filming etc. Once she stumbled upon a secure partner who *adored* her, saw the best in her, was so patient and caring and open, was also really smart and successful, generally had his shit together (rare for our age back then). As her friends we were thrilled and I'm normally very very cynical about people, even I liked this guy. She cheated on him with a lowlife addict abuser because he was boring. She never told him and wasn't remorseful one bit because she was going to break up with him anyway. I almost dropped her that time but couldn't stick to it because I saw that she was battling a lot of demons and I cared for her by then, I'd known her for years.

Besides this aspect of her life we get along and fit really well and I really do care about her. And she has also grown and changed a lot over the course of these years (and so have I) so we don't have as many conflicts and I genuinely have a lot of respect for her because changing as much as she has is truly rare. Like that's really commendable.

The last 3 years were big improvements for her. She got her life in order, mostly had stable relationships (3 in 3 years, which is great considering the whole time I knew her she didn't go a single full week without a relationship and they were all only a couple weeks to 3ish months). The relationships she's been in also weren't abusive, I mean still the anxious-avoidant pairing so not the healthiest, but it was a big upgrade compared to her previous experiences.

But unfortunately, she's found herself in an abusive relationship again. This time it wasn't obvious from the start, the previous ones kind of screamed abuse, it almost started right away because she was just attracted to that type of person. This guy started out fine. I saw red flags and I told her, but there weren't serious enough signs for either of us to be like ""absolutely not this guy, cut contact."" Even now it's more ""on the way to abuse"" than full on abusive. He hasn't hit her, but threatened to, and said he should have and she was lucky he didn't when confronted with how horrible that was. He snaps at mundane things and turns them into long long scolding sessions (like accidentally dropping a plate turns into a 20 minute degrading insults and telling her to get out of his house etc).

Anyway needless to say I told her to break it off. She won't. She admitted she's aware she needs to and is aware this is abuse, but starts generating excuses and one more chances and next weeks when it starts to get real. I assume it's abandonment fear, I think hers has always been stronger than the average I've seen.

She's also started to get suicidal. This has been popping up a couple of times in our conversations since last Fall or so, but I try not to engage because while I know it's horrible to kind of ignore suicidality in a person, I also have my own demons with that subject and I cannot handle it. It's a trigger for me and I don't want to hear about it or talk to a suicidal person. I can't stay emotionally present, especially not in a helpful way. I also haven't really told her this because I don't want to explain it and without explaining it it will seem cruel and uncaring, especially considering her sensitivity about this stuff, and how she tends to personalize this kind of thing.

She brought it up again today and I decided to just kind of try to stick through it this time. But it makes me go through so many feelings, and I feel like I convert it to anger to handle it (this is a very old mechanism of mine and I've learned to manage it, but it comes up when you press the right buttons still). Like I just feel annoyed. I want to snap, and scream, and say are you dumb, why does this matter, stop being dramatic, it's not that deep. I know it's wrong and I even know why it feels so big for her and why it's not overdramatic at all, it's very real. But I still feel so angry.

She tells me she doesn't see the point in life anymore, that she could stomach her parents because she always hoped she would be happy one day and that she would find that happiness in an attachment, but she now feels like she will never be able to fix her attachment, that it won't work with this guy and she doesn't see the point in trying again, and doesn't see any point in life if that is the case. And I'm like why WHY you have your OWN life, why does some dude matter, why does it have to be tethered to someone else. YOU exist, it doesn't matter. All the endless possible problems you could run into in your life WHHHYYY would you feel this over relationships? It doesn't matter and people don't matter, find new meaning in life. People go away. Find a goal, do things you enjoy. Like YOURSELF, not some immature guy.

But I can't say any of this of course because it won't make sense to her and it will make her feel stupid and invalidated but I just don't know what to say. How dare you take your life over some guy? Do you not feel ashamed that your whole worth is reduced to a relationship? How can you stomach being this dependent? It's so horrible. Everyone who loves you already and is there for you why don't they ever matter? Why does it have to be some dumb Hollywood picture? Grow up.

I don't know. I don't know what to say and I don't know how to stop being mad enough to actually help, or I don't know how to say I can't help her with this.",15wqq9a,18,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15wqq9a/cannot_handle_ap_friends_attachment_fixation/,AvoidantAttachment,0
830,Do you think it's accurate to say that a lot of FAs are actually very giving people?,"I feel like I'm FA though moving slowly towards secure. Hard to say as I'm not in a relationship though have done a lot of self work. My therapist said something to me the other day that struck a chord with me as seeming to be true. She said that I'm a very giving person, I give of myself emotionally and otherwise easily and readily. But that I struggle to receive.

I think I saw a video somewhere else too where someone describing themselves as formerly FA and now secure leaning said that she thought that many FAs were very potentially giving people. 

It occurs to me that in how I've faced all of my connections with people I always want other people to feel good about how they see me. I'm not suggesting this is a secure way to view things or healthy as it can be very people pleasing. I think the feelings are genuine though and not just from a place of wanting to please. I've always wanted to be an emotional support for people, wanted to be a safe person to talk to, wanted to listen. I can't say that I've always shown up in this capacity all the time but I think I often do, I definitely strive to. 

I think where things definitely go astray for me is in how my therapist said and I can very much recognize, I'm uncomfortable receiving even though ironically that's what I desperately want. I leave people's emotional gifts for me at the gates and never bring them inside the fortress. 

My therapist said a few weeks back that we could talk about our feelings for each other. Now I think she DID cross a bit of a boundary in doing so because I was talking about romance at the time and my feelings for someone else. And so I felt like she was talking about having feelings for me. I sent her an email though saying I felt that crossed a boundary and wasn't sure if I was comfortable continuing. Her reply and apology was good though so I think I will. Regardless of whether a boundary was crossed or whether she chose a bad time to say what she did. I can see my own response to a degree through the light of my attachment. It's definitely unprofessional for a therapist to voice romantic feelings for their client and totally right for me to draw a line if that is what happened, but I think in part too it was ""uh oh squishy feelings let's leave"". I'm proud of talking with her and possibly seeing how things will continue and at least saying let's see how future sessions go. The communication I've been doing has been improving a lot. 

At any rate this has gotten ramble but my point and question was it does seem to me to be the case that a lot of avoidant people are actually very giving. Perhaps why it's difficult when people get into relationships with us because that giving seems so inviting but then when someone gets close to our wounded hearts we want to shut the gate with such force and finality.",15vu94z,17,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15vu94z/do_you_think_its_accurate_to_say_that_a_lot_of/,AvoidantAttachment,0

I am starting EMDR and already hit a road block. My therapist wants me to come up with negative self-beliefs, but a lot of my attachment related beliefs are fears about others (literally like ""I believe people will lash out or be violent with me if I don't meet their expectations/read their mind"" feels like a super accurate belief). 

She wants me to rephrase this as a self belief (specifically she suggested ""I believe I have to please people"" - which honestly isn't the issue for me, I'm not a people pleaser in general I just have intense fear surrounding intimate situations like dates, so this doesn't feel right, also suggested ""I am inadequate/a failure"" - again doesn't feel right... etc.).

835,Feeling shame after being called out {FA},"Hi all, my FA fling from the past returned recently and we had a conversation about the 2nd time we both went into separation. The last time him and I spoke I said very hurtful things, things I didn't realize I said but he remembered and he asked me why I said all those things. I know it was a defense mechanism and so does he. But he said it's not an excuse and that I said those things despite our connection being so strong. 

I feel like he's now my ""coach"" opposed to my partner because of the way he tells me how we should communicate and he always expresses when I say ""hurtful"" things. Even though he does it in such a kind positive way, I feel so much shame because I'm like... ""oh fuck, I did do that""  or ""oh fuck, I did say that"". 

It's a really confusing situation with this guy because he's great. We're both working through things, he's obviously way ahead of me and that scares me but I feel like there's pressure to be a healthier person and I'm not there yet... HE EVEN KNOWS THIS, and says it. He said work through it with me, don't run away from me and that just makes me feel worse. 

I don't want to lose him for the 3rd time because I know if I lose him this time he's not coming back, he already expressed he didn't want to reach out this time but he did because he felt we both left things unanswered when I ghosted him last time and he knew that I was in peak avoidance because our ""get together again date"" was super intense because of how we always just fall into each other. Both of our boundaries of ""lets take it slow"" and  ""we're just hanging out"" vanish when we're together and then I go into avoidant mode. 

I don't know what to do, because YES he's great, and YES we connect, but connecting with him is so scary because of ME. 

He's the first guy I cried in front of, and he consoled me and treated me with a care that I'm not used to. He literally looks at me with care and that's honestly one of the scariest things I've experienced in a relationship.",10w4e5s,17,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/10w4e5s/feeling_shame_after_being_called_out_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
836,{FA} Running away from the guy that makes me the most vulnerable,"I've posted here quite a bit. I'm an FA and I run away heavily from another FA who operates from a secure pov with me. He's developed a really good understanding of who I am, my past and everything. We met last March, dated for a few months, broke up for a few months hung out for a few weeks and broke up for a few months. He recently returned. 

Every time I'm around him I'm vulnerable. He ended up reaching out again knowing I would be too afraid to do so and we had spoke. Right away I felt like I was trauma dumping because he simply asked, ""why did you say all those rude things to me when we ended things last time?"" He knows I do it from a defensive point of view and even called it out. 

I'm experiencing a real vulnerability hangover and I only get it from this guy, like he really does understand me and it scares me?! He's patient and impatient which is weird because he knows that I go through this, but then when we're dating again he's impatient and likes to address problems right away rather than having it linger, but when I push him away he's literally gone. 

He is an FA and he knows it too, I think he things he operates from a Anxious>Secure but from what his friends told me about him, he was a bit of an avoidant growing up so I think he just forgets about those parts. 

Anyways, the TLDR is that this guy makes me feel vulnerable, literally one of the most caring men I've ever been with in my life and because I know I like him and feel this way, I push him away, I just have such a sudden urge of feeling comfort while i'm with him.",10ruh07,18,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/10ruh07/fa_running_away_from_the_guy_that_makes_me_the/,AvoidantAttachment,0

First, I wanted to say thank you to everyone who helped me out. I was spiralling a bit and y'all helped give me some comfort and peace, and helped me feel like I wasn't alone.

Second, I've figured out why I was feeling so shitty! I'm in the process of leaving my old country and possibly immigrating to a new one. This is something I've wanted for several years, but never quite managed to pull the trigger on.

I've been increasingly unhappy in my old country. The province I grew up in isn't the province of today. The premier is corrupt and gets away with a lot of shit. The healthcare system is going to shit. Forestry and green space is going to shit. Education is going to shit. Housing prices are steeply rising and the possibility of sustainable, long-term housing is going to shit. Winter lasts 7 months, and the warm months are full of mosquitoes.

I'm much happier in my new country. The hobbies and activities that give me fulfillment are so much easier and accessible.

This past Saturday, I met with a person who's giving me a business contract so I can get a work visa. It's the first step towards gaining residency. It's also the first time I'll have left my nest for another home. I've always been a risk-taker, but this is one of the biggest steps I've ever taken in my life.

So, Saturday was new and exciting. Sunday, I had sports to distract me. But Monday, I had an empty day and the ramifications of this new step started to sink in, even though I couldn't label it. In hindsight, it now makes perfect sense why I was spiralling and had a bitch of a time self-regulating. This is definitely what I want, but it's a huge step and totally understandable that I'd have a lot of nerves going forward.",zfyulo,18,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/zfyulo/fa_update_figured_out_why_i_was_so_dysregulated/,AvoidantAttachment,0
839,I’m {fa} going to “break up” with my ex who is a da/fa,"Hi there. So a few months ago I posted here about my DA(FA?) ex reaching out and just saying he misses me and nothing more. Well at one point he reached out with a long apology about not reaching out sooner and said that he was scared that I would never want to see him again but if I do want to see him he would like to speak to me in person. 

I went to see him and it was quite pleasant. He was really excited about things but I kept it level headed and said it’s better to take things slow. Which he agreed to. I also voiced that things can’t just go back to how they were after not seeing each other for almost a year. 

We had some really nice dates. Then he pulled away after I told him that I would like to do more things that will let me in on his interests/ who he is because I felt I was missing that. He agreed to this but then started replying to me after 4/5 days and before that we used to chat daily. After two weeks of that, I couldn’t take the anxiety so I cut contact without really talking things out for around 20ish days so I could just be in a better headspace. After that I apologized for my behavior and he was really happy that I decided to keep seeing him. 

After that we met up on some dates where I felt we really connected. To the point that he was asking me to message him more frequently during the day and extremely communicative. At this point I still wasn’t sure about getting back together but I saw it headed in a positive direction. 

Around 2/3weeks ago we had a nice date that ended up with some sexy time which he initiated. I originally planned to go back to mine and sleep there but I was so tired afterwards and he said I could stay over. When I went in the shower i noticed he still had my shower stuff ( I use a special brand) from last year. I mentioned him having that and he quickly brushed it off, I let it go but it as weird to me since last year he was living somewhere else. So he had to have moved my stuff to his new house with him. After that he started acting a bit weird , he did cuddle me in bed but was less chatty than usual. I went home pretty early the next morning and he suddenly went back to replying late. So I guessed he maybe needed space so I did just that and gave him space, waited a bit longer than usual to message him back (texted back a day later after he did the same). And he disappeared for 10 days and apologized saying he’s just been busy with work. 

I get that he could be busy. But now I can’t help but wonder if he was just attentive/nice to me in the hopes of getting laid. Also regardless of relationship status I’m not comfortable with the extreme distance that he creates every-time we get close or if I ask to do things that connect us a bit more. So I don’t really think that pursuing this will get anywhere. He is also unaware of attachment styles/theory and isn’t doing any work. I recently feel like I’m walking on eggshells and any possible mention or indication of closeness could send him into his avoidance. 

So I plan on dumping him, probably this weekend. I’ve even typed out what I’m going to say and I dread it but things can’t keep going on like this. Because I know I’ll end up resenting him and start associating his behavior with who he is. 

At the same time I can’t help but wonder if I am just deactivated? And this is me running away rather than trying to fix things?",xrfx4h,17,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/xrfx4h/im_fa_going_to_break_up_with_my_ex_who_is_a_dafa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
840,Walking a tightrope {FA},"There's now an UPDATE at the end of this post:

I'm newly cohabiting with my partner (also FA I think), and it's mostly been going great. Mostly secure.

This week has provided some... challenges... though.

I had some medical issues arise which are bringing a lot of anxiety and I am in need of support. But the very next day, my partner essentially hit a wall and started having a mental breakdown of his own. He's agitated, restless, swinging between combative and doting toward me, socially anxious, feeling aimless, not sleeping, not taking care of himself, and just really struggling in general. He's got some big work transitions going on, not to mention me moving in and other changes/stressors in general, so it's not unprovoked. The overwhelm makes sense.

I've been being as supportive as I can and really being there and available—not cutting off or shutting down like I've done in the past, especially because his ""style"" of freaking out can involve some manipulative tactics/guilting/blaming/pouting/picking fights etc—but also working to not do the other thing I do of taking on the responsibility for it. I find different ways of doing this all the time: fixing it, trying to ""figure out"" what's going on either alone or with him, feeling so anxious myself that I lose function in my own life, breaking down myself which allows him to switch into caretaker mode (hi-jacking his emotions/letting him offload them onto my system), cutting off like mentioned above which allows him to point to that as the *actual* reason for his anger/distress AKA scapegoat me.

I'm staying in a position of being available/supportive but not responsible for them. It's HARD to keep this balance, I feel like I'm on a tightrope. It'd be so easy to fall off into avoidance or anxiety. God I'm so FA.

I feel like this combination is actually driving their freakout, exacerbating it. I feel like they're used to me finding a way to take responsibility or to shift things for them emotionally somehow, even by cutting off and therefore being blameworthy. I don't think they're used to the combination of genuine support + not being able to offload onto another... so they're having to just deal with their own emotions.

But I feel the desire to slide off one way or the other. To go crying to him and dig and dig to find out what's really going on and make some kind of a plan to make it better, to tell him I feel this distance/blame from him and to soothe my own anxiety by hashing it out. But I also need to work today, to tend to my own life. So my other impulse is to run. To gather my stuff and go work somewhere else (we both work from home) for the day. To get distant myself and to protect. I can't imagine leaving the house to go work in any other way than packing quietly and then saying at the door with no emotion, ""I'm going to go work somewhere else, I'll see you later."" I can't imagine kissing him or being warm.

Why do my options feel so extreme on either end. How do I walk this tightrope?

Anyone have any recommendations?

UPDATE:

So, while I was having the above internal freakout, I walked the tightrope just giving him some physical affection here and there after asking how he was and telling him I am worried about him, telling him to come interrupt me today if he feels like talking, that I'm here, etc. I also was able to remind him that I'm still in a place where I need some extra support too. He continued to be just kind of distant and zombie-esque.

But then at lunch he asked how I was, and I said I was sad because he's distant and I don't understand what's going on. He sat down ""to talk with me"" but continued to be distant, so I just made myself lunch and didn't try to make anything happen.

Then he said a few sentences about what exactly was stressing him out so much, and I offered some genuine empathy because I really do get it. Then he said that he notices he's been ""taking it out on me,"" and he really doesn't want to do that. I said I appreciated that acknowledgement and that I'd felt the same. He apologized and said I'm his favorite thing in his life right now.

No matter how many times I go through this, I never seem to remember that if I can just kind of manage and not jump to one of my impulses, that I usually don't have to wait very long at all for the other person to step into the space I'm leaving and...reconnect, take some responsibility, etc. whatever's needed.",wlwx5m,17,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wlwx5m/walking_a_tightrope_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0

He is now married, but I keep thinking about how I have made a mistake (I am in a new relationship now). Then there is another guy I ended things with in the dating phase many years ago because I was too scared he would later leave me for another woman which I couldn’t have handled. I found out that his girlfriend is pregnant yesterday and I have been feeling really sad and depressed since then.

Maybe that’s initial defensiveness on my part but I feel that avoidants were portrayed as quite cruel. I would do anything for anyone, I still have a heart.

844,"{da} The more I learn about my attachment style and what a healthy relationship actually entails, the more I realise I’m nowhere near able to deal with a relationship","Before I knew any of this stuff, when I got into relationships I would be pretty comfortable hiding things, lying about where I was, not really sharing my feelings, keeping partners at arm’s length etc. Not to cheat or hurt, but just to keep my independence, and some semblance of control.

I’m not going to say “now I realise that was wrong”, because clearly it’s wrong, but now I realise that relationships based on lies and a lack of intimacy aren’t really worth anything, even if you care about your partner and are not being malicious.

For example, the idea of being committed to someone for the rest of my life didn’t necessarily bother me, because I believed that if your sexual needs weren’t being met in a marriage (due to age/hormones/whatever), you had no option but to look elsewhere (i.e. cheat). Obviously now I realise how perverse that train of thought is, but now the idea of getting in a marriage and losing that control seems worse and scarier than it did before I started this process. 

I’m not quite sure what to do with this information, it’s pretty depressing. I know this stuff takes time, but I’d hoped to be much closer down the path to having healthy relationships by now - the more I learn the more I find that’s wrong with me.",vqmy97,17,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vqmy97/da_the_more_i_learn_about_my_attachment_style_and/,AvoidantAttachment,0
845,{DA} {FA?} How do you identify your own needs?,"So I'm usually DA, but I think I've begun to lean into  FA territory as well, given how high my anxiety is and some tendencies I've noticed.

I'm having a long-term relationship struggle right now, and I've realized that I've never fully ""committed"" to the relationship. I've never said forever - I think I'm always trying to keep a piece of myself safe.

I'm thinking that part of that lack of commitment is also due to the fact that I have refused to assess or acknowledge my big needs. Little ones, sure. But life goal stuff, what an ""equal partnership"" means, the categories surrounding: Time, Sex, Money, Emotional Expression, and Labour (like housework/physical stuff).

My problem is, is that I KNOW I'll needs are going to conflict with my partner. They aren't going to align, which means that we'll have to compromise on what we can, but we will inherently be disappointed on big stuff, or we have to make a very serious choice about continuing the relationship.

So I've been avoiding a lot of them, to the point where clarifying them in a way where I'm not ""flexible"" or in a way that is definitive is really challenging. I can't commit to my own needs, and so I can't commit to my partner.

The other issue is, is a lot of people are like ""find a more suitable partner"", when they talk about conflicting needs or incompatibility.

I'm not thinking of my life in terms of relationships, and it feels reductive to put it in those terms. Am I supposed to only identify my needs in terms of what another relationship looks like to me? Am I supposed to be fantasizing about scenarios to determine what I want? Why am I defining this stuff in terms of an imaginary other person?

I get very internally avoidant, and this is challenging as a result. Any help is appreciated.",vmbv6v,18,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vmbv6v/da_fa_how_do_you_identify_your_own_needs/,AvoidantAttachment,0

The last few relationships I have had involved deactivation at some point. Right around the point (a few days before or after) I deactivate, I get a crushing wall of anxiety. It’s so bad that I can hardly enjoy anything at all. Its a pit in my stomach that I can’t get rid of. No matter how much I try to talk myself through it or accept it, it still just screws me up.

I can handle the swings in the feeling of attraction, but the anxiety is so stressful.

850,Just what's the deal with best friends? {da},"Seriously...what goes on there? 

I have approximately 3 *close* friends who I like equally. I catch up with each of them maybe once a month. We laugh, spill details, act random, have inside jokes. We basically have a great time when we do talk. I'm also totally content with the way things are. 

Have I ever wanted a true ""bestie""? Someone I could text or call any ole time? Of course. But I know myself, and I know that I probably wouldn't do those things. Laziness and busyness and such. 

Except I had always told myself that if the right person came along...I'd be a great friend! We'd be like friends right outta the movies.

You can probably guess what happened... Some friendly motherfucker showed up and shattered the whole image to pieces. This woman has been *persistently* friendly with me. Texting every other day minimum (sometimes every day)! Asking to hang, wondering what I think about the latest episode on our shared TV show, complaining about random stuff in her day, etc. Its been going - no, accelerating - for a few weeks now. I always respond (let's be real, I've been forcing myself to be warm & nice) but at this point I never text or call her first. 

I'm over here just...so over it. Like wtf is she doing. Uugh not again. Every text, every call - cue my deep annoyance.

The main problem is that she's super nice. Smart, funny, and likable. We have a couple of major things in common. She doesn't have any family in town, and has been pretty open about her desire to have more people to turn to. 

So guys, what do I do, lol? Am I being the ahole here - like is this normal behavior between friends..? Or is she just inserting herself into my life? It somehow feels like both things are simultaneously true.

Regardless of reasons, I'm not keeping this up. I feel a bit defeated...but I just can't.

While I understand that some of this is universal, I can also now see just how unfair this is, how much of a burden it is and how it's not anyone's job but mine to heal. 

I've made so much progress on this front over the years in loving myself when im alone. I love myself so SO much more than I used to.

But as soon as I step into the dating arena I'm a 6 year old wanting my mother's acceptance, with sex... lol. It's so Freudian lol and creepy when I think of it. But I know it's the truth. It's so unfair a weight to put on anyone. I can see if I follow it it will make people I'm with feel so unseen, I fantasize them, etc. I won't see those I'm with as fully adult sperate human beings, with all their own flawed humanity.

854,"I (30 F, {da} or {fa}) am afraid of ruining my current relationship","Hey everyone! I am looking for input or insight into this issue. I think I have been working on healing my attachment style but there are still vestigial issues that I should overcome to be normal. I’m not sure if I am dismissive avoidant or fearful avoidant but I know either way I’m messed up!

So, I started dating my current girlfriend, S (32F; I think she is often avoidant but might be anxious with me) in the beginning of this year. Before we were internet/shared industry acquaintances because we met in person three years prior, and then after my break-up with ex girlfriend, L, in May 2021 (which was mostly my fault) I was determined to have a series of casual hook-ups and she expressed interest. We went from sex friends to actual friends who also had sex, and then in December we both realized we had strong feelings for one another, and after talking about it for 2-3 weeks, we decided to officially date.

I honestly feel so different in this relationship in a positive way than previous ones. I don’t have the same anxieties and nagging feeling of thinking “breaking up would be better” when I am spending time with S. One thing I did in previous relationships was constantly compare my partners attractiveness to other people, which is gross, but I don’t do it now. S and I admitted that we felt love-type feelings early on in the official relationship, and I had ACTUALLY felt them before she said it, unlike in other relationships where someone admitted they loved me and I didn’t know what to do. 

I do express my love for her in ways like cooking food for her whenever we hang out, but because of avoidant attachment and whatever else I’m not the best at expressing my feelings verbally. She is usually the more verbally affectionate one. The other night, we did something VERY cheesy and S told me how much she loved me and how important I am to her for a full 30 minutes while we were staring into each other’s eyes. I realized I keep feeling feelings of love towards her no matter how much I try to dismiss them and by the end of her talking to me, I was visibly tearing up and I had to get a tissue. It was great! But it was also very vulnerable and after that I was very much like “that’s enough feelings for today”.

The day afterward, S brought up that I didn’t verbally reciprocate as much and that, while she can tell that I love her, she wanted to know what I was thinking. She also needs some reassurance that this relationship is different from my previous ones (I am admittedly a recovering fuckboy) I tried to explain to her what I was thinking, but she kept asking follow up questions, and at some point I did shut down and feel confused.

I already *knew* that avoidants had trouble identifying and expressing their feelings, but in this moment I *realized* it. I think she was asking for more of explanation for why our relationship would work out beyond “the vibes are different” but that’s all I could give. My girlfriend tries to be very patient with me but I do feel anxious and exhausted at the end of any conversation concerning my feelings. Then she brought up my ex, L, which opened another can of worms (the break-up was messy, I definitely had a spout of sui ideation 5 months after the break-up because I felt so rejected even though I tried to break up with them three times before, etc etc). S accused me of still having lingering romantic feelings for L because I was torn up about that break-up, whereas I thought it was just my mind being bad.

Anyway! I have spend most of my life disconnecting from my feelings and now that I know I should stop doing that, I have no idea how. In fact, if someone asks me my feelings, the first thing I tend to feel is mad about being asked about my feelings! Being vulnerable ilicits a physical feeling in me - sometimes I get nauseous, sometimes I feel my mind astral project randomly because I get Too Many Emotions, sometimes I would rather take a nap. This has been a problem in all of my relationships, and I was hoping S and I’s friendship would make expressing myself easier, but I was wrong! I have been to therapy and I think I have made strides, but this keeps coming up. Sometimes I am afraid that no matter what happens I’ll just ruin this relationship like my 4 other ones and that I am too maladjusted to connect to anyone.

If anyone has ANY insight, I would appreciate it. I am afraid of telling my friends because they may not understand.

Initially I came on strong, I was able to be very intimate, and I was wanting a relationship with this person because I genuinely did love them. My partner initially was trying to take things slow, they were hesitant & being in a relationship almost seemed like it was scary to them since they had trauma from their past relationship. As time went on, they began to become more vulnerable, available, they grew, i grew, the more they were starting to really be invested in our relationship, the scarier it all became and I scared myself when I realized that I could possibly be in love with this person. They are legit the perfect partner. If I ever had to make one up, they fit everything. They are definitely more AP, but have gone to therapy and worked on themselves, and still are. And I have witnessed their growth so much. I love them, but the more they love me, & literally give me everything & pour into me, I feel inadequate, I don’t really know what I’m feeling, but it feels unfair that I can’t do the same back. And all this questioning makes me feel like maybe I don’t love them in the same magnitude. They haven’t done a thing, they’ve communicated, they’ve been patient, they have been respectful to when I needed space, they’ve even recognized when I needed space.  They legit take care of me but I end up feeling even more guilty. This isn’t the first time I’ve felt like this or that I’ve ended things with them. My partner told me that they’ve noticed when things between us are going well that I seem to just deactivate on them. We haven’t been intimate in months and it’s because of me. They’ve asked me about it before but what I could make up is that ever since I’ve been off of my medication for (bipolar , depression & anxiety) that my drive for sex and my desires and attractions have changed, I’ve evolved but I don’t know what I have changed to or what I want. I don’t actually know what is missing, other than myself. I can be myself around my partner, we get along well, we have similar interests, we do fun activities together, we have truly grown with each other.

We broke up last year because of this same situation & took months apart and came back together to try this again after I saw that my partner was going to therapy and became even more of a beautiful person. Yet again, I feel so much guilt because I watch as they’ve poured into me and love me, and for some reason I can’t give that back. And I just end up not knowing anything. I don’t know what I want. There’s so much growing and life to live. I don’t know if im just justifying everything to comfort myself knowing that im literally running away from a person that is the best thing that has ever happened to me. And I feel like shit & like I am spiraling. I do not want to lose them but I’ve already admitted to them that I don’t think I love them the same way.",svj4o6,17,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/svj4o6/unable_to_give_the_same_love_back_da_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
864,Broke up with my boyfriend and it's hell,"Apologies in advance because this will be long. I can't really talk about this with anyone in my real life so this is me trying to process. (I literally just erased a huge post and will try to do bullets to condense). 

* We had a rough few interactions around my birthday on the 16th. He said hurtful things, and I went off on him telling him he was doing everything he could to push me away and it was working. 
* After that conversation, he says he wants to go all in and really try. He wants to do things together like cook, and is open to meeting my family. Implies he wants to live together eventually and brings up marriage. 
   * The next day, I asked if he meant those things and he said ""Kind of"" and we've never spoken of it again
* Within a couple of days I went to his house, got drunk, and rambled about wanting a real relationship and knowing he didn't and we should just end things because I didn't want to get hurt and he couldn't admit he wanted the same thing. He told me he loved me 3 times (unheard of, he almost never says it first) and told me I needed to stop. 
* After that, he deactivated hardcore. We have one gone more than a few days without seeing each other 3 times in the last 14 months (separate vacations at the same time, a brief split, and when he had COVID). 
   * I didn't hear from him for a week. He would respond when I messaged, but it was cold. 
   * I asked at the week mark if he was okay - he said yes, just didn't feel very talkative
* A few days later (10 day mark?) I messaged and asked if we were good because I didn't want to be sitting at my house waiting on him if he was sitting at his house wanting to be done. That the distance hurt. He says we're good, he's sorry if he hurt me, he's just been in his own head lately
* I had a rough therapy session where my therapist plays devil's advocate about my relationship, says we're both standing in our own way. He doesn't think we'd be able to live together. He doesn't think I'll ever be able to move on from my boyfriend. He doesn't think I'll ever let my guard down enough to have a happy relationship. 
* I spend the next two days drafting a break up text to my boyfriend. Partly because I feel like he's pulled away because he's done and I don't think I can handle hearing that from him, so I should just do it first. Partly because I don't have it in my to fight for someone to love me again, especially him. Partly because even if he's deactivated, that lack of communication and contact isn't fair to me. He's not the only one in the relationship. 
   * I decide not to send it. I decide to wait and see if he reaches out like he normally does on Sunday, and if not then I'll send it (this is Friday). 
   * I go to sleep on Friday and have vivid dreams - I had a dream where he ended things and was very mean. I woke up and checked my messages - nothing from him. So I sent the stupid text. 
* Haven't heard from him since. Nothing. This is literally the one scenario I wasn't prepared for. I expected him to reply and either say ""let's figure out how to fix it"" or ""You're right, I'm done."" Silence? The silence is somehow worse. 
* In true FA fashion, I am rapidly flipping between ""You did the right thing"" and ""Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck why did you do that?!?!?"" It's not what I want. I know this wasn't protest behavior, because I didn't do it hoping to elicit any kind of anything from him. I knew if it was really over, I'd be okay. I did it because I felt lost, unstable, unsafe with the distance/lack of communication. And now I just feel even more lost. After almost 6 years and everything we've been through, I'm not even worth a response? 
   * Logically, I know this could have been a total blindside to him and maybe he needs time to process before responding, but fuck. I would not leave the person I love hanging like this. 
   * Also logically I know this was a bid to try and control a situation that felt uncontrollable to me and truly just me being avoidant myself because I don't know how to communicate in a healthy way the things I need in a way that may have restored everything. 

&#x200B;

Best part? We work together so I have to see/hear him all day, Monday through Friday. I walked in today and of course, because the universe is a motherfucker, I round the corner and he's right there walking towards me. He said good morning, which makes it all even worse. How can  you pretend we're okay when we're so clearly not okay?

865,Trying to Keep Your Partner Out of Your Depression/Anxiety Issues,"My (normally) securely attached boyfriend has communicated to me that he starts to feel abandoned if I go quiet on him for a day or 2, even though he says he knows it's illogical. I don't know what else I can do to reassure him that it's me and my own issues, not him.

On a fairly regular basis I experience very bad depressive and anxiety episodes a few times a week.  It's not fair to unload this onto someone, especially if they may not be equipped to deal with it. I can't just chat and communicate like nothing has happened, I bury myself in my work, my animals, the TV...whatever can distract me to stop going down a darker route. 

I can't really give you a reason for the depression; general dissatisfaction/pointlessness in life and being unable to change it for the present I guess? I feel like the more I care about him, the more I push him away from this side of me to protect him. I don't like opening up, and the few times I've had this conversation with him about it not being his fault and trying to explain my feelings and reassure him, it's almost physically painful for me to make myself vulnerable.

866,"Core Wounds, Self-Sabotage, and Vulnerability - Story Time","I had therapy for the first time in about 3 weeks yesterday. I've been doing telehealth because of work, but I'm needing to start EMDR back up so I went in person. I've been struggling lately, and we didn't actually get to EMDR because I had a complete breakdown. I wanted to share some of the things that came out of it to process, see if anyone relates, or maybe to help someone. 

* My therapist had to run to the front desk for a chart, and by the time he came back I was in tears. Because I'm scared to death to do EMDR again. The way my therapist and I do EMDR is picking a core wound phrase and the phrase we want to change it to. My first round we did ""I'm unlovable"" and changed it to ""I'm lovable."" At the time I thought this was my biggest core wound. In our last session before the big gap, we discussed that I felt like I was lovable, but that I didn't feel like I deserve to be loved. So that's what we were going to target. Except that I discovered it goes so much deeper than that. Not only do I not believe I deserve to be loved, but that I don't deserve to even exist. This wound drives everything that I do, and I am self sabotaging hard core at this point because of it. The thought of facing it and healing and allowing myself to be happy scares the shit out of me. Because I'm afraid that if I allow myself to be happy, then the first bad thing that happens will break me and ruin all of the progress I've made. 
* I was at my boyfriend's the other night, and we were laying in bed together. I was feeling not in a good place, and had asked that we just sleep rather than have sex. He started to run his hands all over my body, and I got triggered. I *felt* like he was doing it because he loved me, but I *thought* he was doing it to initiate sex. I started a deep spiral thinking about how my dad never showed me physical affection. None of my boyfriends showed me physical affection except to initiate sex - one boyfriend was physically abusive. My first ex husband wouldn't even sleep in the same bed as me, and never showed me physical affection. My second ex husband only showed it when initiating sex, and would withhold it as punishment. Not a single man in my life has touched me out of love. So there's no possible way this man could be. So I asked him - are you touching me because you love me or because you want to have sex? He responded with - why can't it be both? Okay..... why can't it?! Why is my thinking so black and white? 
   * We ended up having a back and forth and I decided to be vulnerable and share why I was asking that. He started to respond but his son woke up so he went to check on him. When he came back, he lay down facing away from me and didn't say anything. I asked if he was going to just end the conversation. He said he felt like I had my mind made up and nothing he could say would help. The ex that punished me would do this - turn away from me on purpose to abandon me. I was triggered. I told my boyfriend that it was shitty that I opened up and now he was shutting down the conversation as if I'd done something wrong. He immediately said ""No, you didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that every man has let you down. I'm sorry that I didn't listen better or respond better."" And my thought was ""How dare you validate me? That's just making this all worse.""
* I'm retelling that whole story to my therapist, and I finally tell him my biggest fear in this relationship. That if I accept that this man truly loves me, and I allow myself to love him with everything I have, I'm afraid he'll turn into the other men in my life. That he'll destroy me. My therapist had two really great points about this thought. 
   * My boyfriend has had plenty of opportunity to act like the previous men in my life. Yet every time he has the opportunity to reinforce my belief that I don't deserve to be loved, he instead reinforces that he does truly love me. 
   * He pointed out how ridiculous my fear is after a year of my boyfriend consistently showing me he loves me. He said ""It's like thinking he's a vampire, but he doesn't bite unless you're around him too long. His fangs only come out after 6 hours of being together."" Well, when he put it like that it did feel ridiculous. Why am I afraid of something that hasn't happened at all in the last year? If he was going to be like them, he surely would have by now, right? So basically I'm just self sabotaging at this point. 
* I want to share all of this with my boyfriend, but we're two avoidants and it's just not going to happen. After all of that I was so exhausted I went to bed at 7:30. My phone went off with his text tone twice in a round around 9:45pm and woke me up. In my half asleep exhausted state, I decided to tell him that this is my core wound, and I'm afraid that he'll reinforce those beliefs like a lot of other people in my life have. But that my therapist told me he's had every opportunity to and has only shown me he truly loves me. I told him that I hoped I was a safe place for him, just like he was for me. That he's a good man, and that I love him. 
   * He responded with humor, basically saying he doesn't like my therapist. This is his go to response when my therapist has been spot on about him and he doesn't like being seen like that. I've witnessed it in person from him - you can tell on his face that my therapist is exactly right and he doesn't like it because someone he's never met can figure him out. And figure out the side of him that he hides from the world. He also uses humor to deflect when he's uncomfortable. 
      * Most of the time that's okay, but there are times when it's hard for me to be vulnerable, and the humor response makes me not want to do it again. So I asked him if he wanted to try again with a serious response. To be honest, I use this tactic with my toddler when he's mean when he asks for something (do you want to try again nicely?). It always works, and feels like a safe way to call my boyfriend out while also asking for a need of mine to be met. 
      * He responded to that with ""I can't, but yes."" Four simple words but also so weighted. Four words that say so much more than what they appear on the surface. I can't be that vulnerable, but I want to. Or maybe I can't respond, but yes to everything you said. Either way, such an incredibly avoidant but vulnerable sentence made of 4 words. How many times have I felt that way? How many times have I wanted to do something, but I can't be that vulnerable? How many times have I wanted to show up the way someone wants, but I can't? 
* The biggest thing I realize is that this is the first time I've truly loved someone. This is the first time I've felt safe. This is the first time I've been able to challenge my core wounds, and dig deeper to find the real ones. This is the first time I've felt okay to stop avoiding myself. I can only take partial credit because I truly believe my avoidant boyfriend is the main reason. His avoidance has forced me to work through my issues on my own - has forced me to challenge my inner dialogue and to become more secure. And even if it doesn't work out - and I'm starting to believe that it will - this man has helped me heal more in the last year than I have the 30 years prior. And I will never be able to thank him enough for that. I just hope that someday he lets me in enough that I can do the same for him. 

tl;dr - Therapy fucked my shit up yesterday. I believe I don't deserve to exist, let alone be loved, which is the core of my avoidance. My avoidant boyfriend reinforces daily that he truly loves me, and now I have to challenge those beliefs. But at least I feel safe to do so thanks to him.",s1dr8u,17,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/s1dr8u/core_wounds_selfsabotage_and_vulnerability_story/,AvoidantAttachment,0
867,DBT Skills Series: Check the Facts,"Checks the Facts is an Emotion Regulation DBT skill. It is meant to help you see if the emotion and intensity of your emotion match the situation. It's helpful to use when you can't move past an intense emotion surrounding an event. 

\*Facts  
Many emotions and actions are set off by our thoughts and interpretations of events, not by the events themselves. 

Event → Thoughts → Emotions 

Our emotions can also have a big effect on our thoughts about events. 

Event → Emotion → Thoughts 

Examining our thoughts and checking the facts can help us change our emotions.

**How to Check the Facts**   
1. Ask:   
What is the emotion I want to change?   
2. Ask:   
What is the event prompting my emotion?   
Describe the facts that you observed through your senses.   
Challenge judgments, absolutes, and black-and-white descriptions.   
3. Ask:   
What are my interpretations, thoughts, and assumptions about the event?   
Think of other possible interpretations.   
Practice looking at all sides of a situation and all points of view.   
Test your interpretations and assumptions to see if they fit the facts.   
4. Ask:   
Am I assuming a threat? Label the threat.   
Assess the probability that the threatening event will really occur.   
Think of as many other possible outcomes as you can.   
5. Ask:   
What’s the catastrophe? Imagine the catastrophe really occurring. Imagine coping well with a catastrophe (through problem solving, coping ahead, or radical acceptance).

868,Book recommendation: Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents,"By Lindsay Gibson.

This is a book that was recommended to me by someone in another sub. I only got around to picking it up today and it is very interesting so far. She talks about the different coping responses by children to emotionally immature parents. I am finding a lot of resonance in the section on ""Internalizers"", which I already knew I was, but she discusses their tendencies in more depth. This includes in relationships: tendency to independence, tendency to attract needy people.  She goes on to discuss ways forward.

While this book doesn't specifically discuss attachment styles, many here have had neglectful or rejecting parents and I thought it might be of interest.",rgih60,16,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/rgih60/book_recommendation_adult_children_of_emotionally/,AvoidantAttachment,0
869,BF and I just broke up - I don’t know if I’ll ever have a healthy relationship,"We’ve been dating for 3-4 months seriously. He knew from the beginning that I didn’t have a typical childhood. He was good at being patient and calling me out on my defense mechanisms. I began therapy about the same time (it was something that I was mentally preparing myself for for a while).

After my intake session, my therapist said I’d made a lot of progress on my own. She also wanted me to research ‘avoidant attachment disorder’ and ‘pseudo-independence’ and see if I identified with either of them (note: I love to research and she was aware.) I identified with both, as well as CPTSD (look up Dr. Ramani on YouTube - she’s amazing).

So on went the relationship. We’d see each other once a week (we are both single parents) and text pretty much all the time. I honestly think at some points we over-analyzed my disorder. But also, it’s nice to have him listen and understand.

He is also sarcastic (I am too), and sometimes he triggers me because I have no idea if he’s serious or not. He feels that I need to let small mistakes go (and not bring them up again) despite the hurt. I honestly don’t know anymore.

This past week he made a joke that a little birdie told him all my secrets and has been keeping tabs on me. We live in a small town. I immediately had a physiological response and felt panicked, like I’d been betrayed. He’d always said I could go to him when I was ready, and I felt he’d violated this. 

When I asked him for details (who and what) he tried acting like he didn’t know what I was talking about twice, and then said “I was joking. You’re upset about that?”

Well yeah, I’ve had people actually do that to me before (spy and keep tabs). Also, I cannot control how my body responds to something that has been ingrained in me since birth. We barely talked for a few days, and when I told him I don’t trust him, he called it off. The thing is, I’m willing to work through it. I know I need to move past my insecurities and process everything better. But I’m also not going to force him to try to make this work.

I feel there’s no breaking down my walls for good. Every time I go through a break up, I repeat these negative thoughts: I’m unlovable, I’ll never find someone, I’ll be alone forever. I feel worthless. I spend hours crying, feeling hopeless. I’m still in therapy and don’t plan on stopping, but part of me feels like giving up on everything. Is there a point? Can I heal from this?

Please be kind in your responses, I’ve cried enough this week.",pvarim,17,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/pvarim/bf_and_i_just_broke_up_i_dont_know_if_ill_ever/,AvoidantAttachment,0
870,Attunement and Avoidance,"I commented on the recent validation post and had a realization. The more secure I behave, the easier it is for me to be attuned to my partner. I'm able to pick up on some of his needs without him voicing them. I'm also able to pick up on the need that he's voicing without outright voicing his need. For example, when he cooks something and asks me to try it, he always asks if it's good. But he's not really asking if the food is good, he's asking if he did a good job. 

Lately I've noticed that as I'm behaving more securely (communicating directly about my feelings and needs, recognizing my triggers, taking accountability for my actions, and allowing the relationship to be what it is instead of pressuring him to make it something more), he has been opening up more and being less avoidant. 

I also recognize the ways that he is validating me more, rather than focusing on ways that he's not. I feel he is very attuned to me as well, especially in person. 

It made me wonder if the more your partner is attuned to you, and can address your needs without you needing to voice them, does that help you be less avoidant? Sometimes I'm not even sure what I need, so I can see how when my partner somehow manages to meet those without me needing to say them, it makes it easier for me to connect to him.

I might not be interested in relationships in the same way most people are.

That's ok because I'm fulfilled. 

Every day, I work towards understanding myself and others because I'm genuinely curious! And its fun to speak my mind and challenge myself to listen to others. Its a brand new experience and tickles the hell out of me.

I can let go of relationships easily but that's not because I don't care. I just have a strong sense of what temporary means. That everything is fleeting. Time is rushing past so fast. I have spent more time living far apart from my closest friends than locally. I've seen how they've changed and how they've stayed the same. ""A life time ago"", as one always echoes.

We are creating many different versions and instances of ourselves and others on the daily and that's incredible. We can shed parts of our attachment style in small different ways any day, every day. We can even pick some back up for a time and maybe that serves us, maybe it doesn't.

873,"reviews on ""Attachment and the Defence Against Intimacy""","My thanks to u/tpdor for recommending this book in a recent post on the sub. Have any others here read it and have thoughts about it? Especially if you have identified as having an avoidant attachment style?

Edited by Linda Cundy (2019), a psychotherapist, the audience for this book is other counselors and other professional psychologists. It's not self-help or a basic introduction. Short– four chapters and 113 pages– and dense, if you have some education in developmental psychology and counseling theory or similar coursework, you will get through it in a weekend. I wonder though: The book could overwhelm, if I were just accepting this about myself or a partner for the first time?

The book consistently reinforces avoidant behaviors ***are adaptive***. The book gives varied examples–instead of just one– of parenting that give rise to an avoidant attachment style, as infants and children are doing their very best to navigate the world despite having caregivers who are mis-tuned or unavailable to their childrens' natural emotional states and growth.

This book helped me make sense of things that happened in my relationship with my ex. I let go of some of my confusion– and resulting anger over time–  about things he said that didn't make sense to me. (I now see how they might make sense for him!) I was able to understand more of his behaviors through new eyes of compassion, which helped me forgive. It offered me insight about me, him, us, and attachment theory that I couldn't get from the therapist I used in the course of our break. When my ex disclosed he thought he was avoidant, I recalled a developmental psychology course from my undergrad degree, which I had put out of mind– my master's and professional work is another area. I wish I knew all this earlier.

One whole chapter covers relationship dynamics. I recognized my and my ex's experience here as one that is common for others, which is validating, and could see how these dynamics played out somewhat predictably. Despite ""ah-ha"" moments in reading though, the book avoids boxing up avoidant attachment with sweeping generalizations.

The book's subtitle hints at the occasional discussion of other challenges that people with avoidant styles may experience differently, for example, social anxiety. These discussions illuminate how these challenges arise differently than, for example, for someone else who also has social anxiety but has a secure or anxious style.

Again, this isn't a self-help book with easy suggestions or solutions (whether you are in a relationship with someone who is avoidant or you have an avoidant style). If you read between the lines, you may improve your intuition for what not to do *and why*, if you are trying to relate with someone who has an avoidant style.

TL;DR: This book is not written for a general audience or as self-help, but it may help you understand avoidant attachment in a much more nuanced, complex, and non-judgemental way.",mz4csk,18,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/mz4csk/reviews_on_attachment_and_the_defence_against/,AvoidantAttachment,0
874,Curious about the real needs of DA's,"So, me and my SO/best friend have been through a lot in the past year. It went from hooking up to breaking up to being best friends to hooking up again and now being in an 'undefined' phase. 

I went from being anxious to being secure. My self worth is no longer dependent on his deactivations, I understand his need for space and I know I don't have to hope for a secure commitment, I have to decide which route I want our relationship to take, which I'm figuring out. 

However, there is one thing I still don't understand. He talks a lot about needing space, being independent and not wanting responsibility for anyone else's feeling. When he talks like that, he tends to get really cold and distant. I get what he's saying, but I can't help noticing how sensitive/vulnerable he actually is. I see him glow up when people give him compliments, I see how he (most of the time) feels safe around me and really starts being himself. When someone insults him, he carries it with him like a load. I know he has been bullied and hurt in the past. Maybe I'm projecting, but I see a very sensitive person that is very scared getting hurt. 

Since he is my best friend and I feel in a secure position where I have enough emotional energy, I'm wondering how I can show that he can trust me if he needs something. I don't know how to find a balance between giving him space and showing that I'm here for him. So, my question to other DA's is: what is it you actually need? I saw this meme (don't know if it was here) that said something like avoidants wanting you to get really close while they try everything in their power to not let you get there. Is this true? 

I see and talk to him every day but it's almost never a planned meet-up (we work in the same place so we run into each other daily).",mr9wga,16,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/mr9wga/curious_about_the_real_needs_of_das/,AvoidantAttachment,0
875,"Avoidant men, what attracts you?","Avoidant men here, fearful or dismissive, have you ever noticed a pattern in your attraction?
I’m asking this for self research purposes. Do you know what attracts you that seems to be a pattern in the other partner? Literally anything. 

I’ve heard some avoidants saying safety and security, so they’re usually attracted to women with loyalty or “quiet” past (few to none exes). I have read avoidants being into Preoccupied types, in order to have some control, which is understandable too. I have also heard a lot about avoidants being into other avoidants because of the familiar environment, which I can relate to. Maybe it’s an attempt to relive the situation but gain control this time.

Personally, I noticed the characteristics that I always found attractive, like “calm, cold, lowkey” etc were all suitable for avoidant behavior. So I find it interesting that one avoidant would find other avoidants attractive, since I often read that there’s no chemistry between avoidants because there’s no polarity. I would strongly disagree, it gives the opportunity to relive the familiar situation that’s so deeply rooted in us. 

What are you attracted to in other people? I’m curious if I can gain new interesting insights.",lsro9m,17,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/lsro9m/avoidant_men_what_attracts_you/,AvoidantAttachment,0
876,My experience,"I think I've had fearful attachment issues for a while. Both of the relationships that I've been in started out with me being super caring and close with the person, and then getting more and more anxious and starting to draw away. I get scared about being open with people and I'm not good at communicating needs and boundaries, but even still, I always do better about it at the beginning. I know that in both cases there were other things happening as well, but that issue was definitely a big part of why things didn't work out. 

I don't know why it even happens, really. I just start to get scared about expectations and not meeting them- especially since I already need to work on my communication skills and frequency even without an attachment problem. I don't have any idea where the problem came from, either. A lot of things that I read about it talk about childhood trauma and shitty parents but any trauma I have is unrelated to the people who raised me. I've never been in any kind of abusive relationship or anything, either. 

I wish I wasn't like this because in my last relationship I could feel myself closing off and, coupled with a bout of severe mental health problems flaring up, I ended up probably being way more of a piece of shit than I realized at the time. I kept avoiding talking or responding and a lot of the time our conversations were just us kind of arguing about my lack of communication.

At the time I thought I was not as in the wrong as I really was and now I know that's not true. I don't think I'll ever be able to have a relationship where I don't end up doing something like that, either. I try to reciprocate and put as much efforts into things as the other person, but eventually I run out of energy and start getting scared. 

One thing I don't get is that this whole thing doesn't really apply to my friends. I have two friends that I've known and been close to for over five years and I'm terrified of them leaving or giving up on me all the time, but it just makes me want to hold on even tighter. I guess maybe it's because their style of affection is more mild and sometimes they communicate even less than me, so I don't have to feel the pressure of performance as much? I'm not sure.",15w00ow,17,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15w00ow/my_experience/,AvoidantAttachment,0
877,did anyone else misbehave when younger?,"i’m avoidant, but i’m trying to process why. my mom is pretty avoidant as well, but i was also an awful child.

i used to run from her in the mornings bc i hated school, making her late from work; i’d kick her seat; throw myself on the ground in stores; throw tantrums; they’d lock me in my room and i’d kick the door for hours. my stepdad was basically my dad- he wanted 3 kids before getting married to my mom, but dealing with me made him want none. (he was more of an understanding figure to me than my mom was.. surprised he stuck around). 

anyways.. i see things saying the caregiver (of an avoidant attachment style) was emotionally unavailable when needed… could this emotional unavailability be due to the child misbehaving therefore pushing the caregiver away/fostering some resentment?

880,We adapted to what worked {fa},"Ive been thinking about what makes an avoidant. And this isn’t new for many of you but it hit different today. I think for anxious folks, they were able to get their wants and needs met by excessive effort on their part while the other person didn’t do the same. But for avoidance (from my experience) I would try to dump energy and attention at the person but they still didn’t give me the affection I wanted. So instead I learned to self sooth which became avoiding my emotions and needs and isolating myself from connection. 

Which maybe sounds like ‘duh that’s literally what avoidant means’. But through that I noticed I’ve been expecting potential partners to earn my attention and if they pull back even a smidge I bail…which I recognize is something for me to work on. But! Being able to recognize that has helped it occur to me how much effort I should be putting in. And that I should be willing to give what I want to receive! And that I shouldn’t hope for the most while also giving the least.

And noticing and putting things to practice are two different things but in my mind it’s bridging the gap between where I was and where I want to be",15cvsaa,16,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/15cvsaa/we_adapted_to_what_worked_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
881,How to progress in therapy when you have nothing going on? {da},"I’ve been struggling most of my life with forming relationships and close bonds with people. I have a few friends that I barely see, and pretty much avoid dating all together. I discovered avoidant attachment last year and I feel like I’m on such an extreme end of it, I won’t even allow myself to get near situations where there is potential to get triggered. I decided to try therapy for the first time because the loneliness is finally catching up to me. It’s been about 8 weeks, but I don’t feel like I’m achieving anything. Every week she’ll ask me what I want to talk about, or what I have coming up the next week that I feel distressed about. She’s given me DBT worksheets and taught me some breathing and visualization exercises to deal with distress and always asks if I’ve had the opportunity to practice them, but the problem is, I have nothing to practice with because there’s nothing happening in my life. Most of my interactions are pretty surface level and there’s nothing to dig into. When I express this, she seems stumped and doesn’t really know where to go from there. Not sure if she’s a bad therapist or if I’m just not giving her enough to work with. 

Even outside of therapy, when I try to work on stuff on my own (I’ve done one of the Thais Gibson courses) I have trouble figuring out how to progress when I have nothing, no relationships or anything, to measure my success against.

It's been a rough week and I'm feeling so drained. My mom was just in the hospital again (she's OK), and our relationship is very complicated and so it brings up some stuff for me. I was sorta suppressing feeling anything about it this whole week and all of a sudden it feels like everything is catching up to me and I'm overwhelmed.  And honestly right now I just want to hibernate in a closet and not be perceived by anyone for at least 24 hours so I can sort myself out. When I'm around the people I love and I'm overwhelmed like this I feel so edgy, like if someone so much as looks at me I might implode. It's like all the emotion is balled up in my throat, and I have to run away otherwise I might turn into a raging beast. Once I'm alone I can finally relax and figure out how exactly I'm feeling.

On a whim last night I had invited my partner out on a date yesterday (for tonight). Flaking out on a date last minute feels like a bit of a dick move, even though I know he would probably understand. I went back and forth all afternoon at work. I think I'm probably going to go, perhaps enjoy a stiff drink (not healthy, ikikik), and I think I'll try opening up about everything going on. I think I can try being vulnerable without the world ending. I'm hoping since I had a good cry alone about it earlier the intensity will have dissipated.

I have never felt in love with someone I was dating, and would like to experience that feeling as well as find a partner to build and grow with.

I have a date with someone else set up for Sunday, but I can’t seem to get over feeling guilty about seeing other people. How long is it ok to date casually for? And what is ok to do while dating casually? The person I’ve been out with 5 times would like to plan a day trip and that sounds exciting to me, but I also don’t want to lead her on incase I have to break things off.

887,What to do when your triggers are not anything your partner is doing wrong? {da},"My gf (not official yet but easier to refer to her this way) is really great, and I usually love spending time with her. However, some of her behaviors trigger me, and they are really pretty harmless and normal behaviors.

For example, she was recently stuck in some horrible parade traffic where cars where driving unsafely and honking like crazy. She was very upset and stressed after being in her car for over an hour in what should have been a 5-minute trip. She was texting me about how stressed she was, and eventually I called her. 

Just hearing her negative feelings about this was trigger for me, and it made me anxious and uncomfortable that night through the next day.

I don’t rationally think there’s anything wrong with how she reacted. Her feelings were very valid and understandable. Anybody in that situation would be totally stressed out. So why did it cause me to deactivate and feel distant?

And then what do I do to let her know about this? I feel so bad bringing it up because I know it’s not her fault.

888,Dealing with passive aggressive comms {FA},"I'm running into a REAL challenge living with my \[probably FA leaning AP\] partner as an avoidant leaning FA. Hoping for some ideas on how to respond better if any of you have dealt with this kind of thing. 

We just started living together, and they're easily frustrated when they can't find something in the house. They seem to assume that I've moved it or somehow their not being able to find it is my fault (I often feel arbitrarily blamed for whatever happens in general in this relationship, something I've learned to express and work with on my end, and it has gotten better.) I simply **do not know how to respond** in these very acute instances though.

Here's a specific example: 

The other day they started clearly looking for something in such a way where I know they're assuming I put it somewhere, because they start slamming drawers open and closed and stomping around loudly while they look. Turns out, they couldn't find a battery charger and came in to ask me (we both work from home, and they interrupt me *a lot* while I'm working. I've gotten much better at not basically locking them out and being rigid about this even though it's still irritating.) I didn't know where it was, so I told them I didn't know. They looked very upset by this and to me it seemed like they thought I was lying for some reason. 

I used to give into this kind of thing and stop what I was doing to solve their problem because I would feel guilty and overly responsible for everything, and like I was being mean if I didn't, but I've been working on this, so I stood by the fact that I don't know where it is, which was true, and that I needed to keep working. Seriously sticking by 'I'm not sure' or ""I don't know"" or ""I need to think about that more"" while still being kind and affectionate to them, and without letting them try to drag out more from me feels like a **superpower** and has really lead to them facing the ways they push on me, which is great. 

About 60 seconds later, after slamming the same drawers open and closed a few more times, they came in again, very distressed, ""do you have *any* ideas at all?"" still trying to rope me into solving the problem. I said that I didn't, I'm sorry, because I've never used the item they're looking for and really have never observed its whereabouts generally. I truly didn't know. They seemed to be getting angrier and angrier that I wouldn't stop what I was doing to help them, but they also weren't asking me to directly, and again, it felt like they were blaming me for everything. 

Meanwhile, my nervous system is in full fight-or-flight mode, I feel trapped and overly responsible and blamed for no reason—basically scapegoated for their distress, which is what always happened in my childhood. But I'm doing all I can to remain calm, tell them I'm sorry they can't find it, and that I can help when I take a break form work in a little while when I'm at a good stopping point (all things I've been learning to not just lock the door or leave the house instead :) About 2 minutes later they found it on their desk. 

I'm very frustrated because I feel like I am used as a problem solving machine before they really make an attempt to solve it on their own. It's something that I think I'll talk to them about soon. They're sick right now so I'll wait until they're feeling better.

But in the meantime, what's the best way to respond to this kind of thing? I get so triggered by this kind of communication (slamming around, getting distressed, trying to put it on me, expecting me to be available at the very moment they need me to always, etc.) — how can I respond in a way that doesn't throw gas on the fire for them but also respects my own needs: to keep working (I'm slammed at work this week), to not be responsible for where everything is in the house, for them to actually look around before asking me, etc.

They hang out every day no problem (how??) and they keep asking me why I'm so quiet and what's wrong and honestly it just makes it worse.

891,"{da} found a nice guy, might just self sabotage","I met this guy who seems to be secure and says he wants exactly what I’m looking for which is a polyamorous relationship with one primary partner to live and have a family with. Our beginning was very slow. He told me he liked me from the minute he matched me on OLD. He wants me to be his primary and I’m looking for a primary. He’s very nice to me and treats me well and have so far proven he in fact wants the same thing as I do. But as a dismissive avoidant I keep trying to find reasons to run away from him. If he buy me flowers I’m thinking, “what do you want from me?” If he tells me I’m pretty I feel repulsed. If he offer to pay for a trip together he must be love bombing me. It took 3 months for us to actually have sex. Though in the beginning I wasn’t sure if I liked him but I slowly warmed up to him. He doesn’t know if I even like him even if I tell him I do. I get why too because I would be super stoic and cold when I tell him I like him or I miss him. I don’t compliment him much and I close off if he gives me “too” much attention. And the only reason why I started warming up to him because he told me he really likes his other partner. I felt a lot of pressure lifted from me when he said that. I didn’t feel like I would be 100% responsible for his happiness or sadness. I hate disappointing others and being disappointed. He’s always been consistent with his affection and I’ve been wishy washy. I can’t stop being cold to him and questioning everything that he does. I’ve told him I’m avoidant and he’s probably the most secure guy I’ve dated and it’s making me feel weird. He’s been patient with me and still want to be with me. If I don’t change, it’ll be a matter of time he’ll get tired of trying and move on. And I probably won’t fight it either. So hard to let people in and trust that they won’t hurt you. 

I’ve gone through a few years of therapy and been trying to break my avoidant behaviors. Giving this guy a chance was a big step for me. I wanted to run away the minute I met him but I stayed and sat with my discomfort.

897,Deactivating Again {fa},"I’m so frustrated today.

I’ve been seeing a guy for about a year. We’ve mutually crushed on each other for a while and the stars aligned and we started dating. It was going really well initially, we’d both been working on ourselves and I came into it thinking that we were going to communicate really well. I was proud of myself for picking someone who seemed secure, I felt like I’d broken a cycle.

Of course, I was vulnerable and shared some of my trauma and anxiety, and it feels like it’s all downhill from there. He asks me how I’m doing (or he used to, he’s stopped) with my anxiety, and I’ll give a real answer, but when I ask him how he’s doing I just get an “okay.” I express my needs, he doesn’t except to sometimes wonder aloud whether he should be spending more time alone, and it hurts me that I’m out here asking for hugs and affirmation and what he needs from me is just…less. I have only the slightest idea what’s important to him in a relationship or what makes him feel loved, other than that he’s got a guess at his love language. I’ve expressed that I have some unmet needs and every time we have that conversation the actual talk goes great, I leave it feeling both reassured and proud of myself for communicating in a secure way, but then instead of getting more of what I need I get less. For instance, we had a talk about how I love how often he starts conversations with me when we’re not together, but I also need words of affirmation, not just random chat, and not only have I not gotten any words of affirmation since that conversation two weeks ago, but he’s cut way back on how often he initiates ANY conversation with me. I‘m in a position where I feel as though I need to play detective to figure out what’s going on with him, which is a core attachment wound for me, because in childhood it was expected that I would just anticipate and fulfill all of my mom’s emotional needs from a very young age, or she would withdraw from me.

So of course, to protect myself from the disconnect between his behavior when we’re apart and his behavior when we’re together and the ways his behavior is reminding me of my trauma, I’m hardcore deactivating. I’m scrolling through photos and reading old texts and notes like I’m picking at a hangnail, and there is just nothing there at all. I’m usually more AP leaning, but I’m not even feeling anxious, I’m just bored and annoyed. We’re supposed to see each other soon and I find myself wishing that I had an excuse, or that he’d make one. I don’t want to see him. I don’t want to see anyone. I don’t want to do anything. I want to move to the woods.

I know that rationally that I will be upset and regretful if I just give up, but all I want is for there to be a summer camp for adults where you just sit in silence in a treehouse for two weeks.

898,{FA} 7 years of working on myself and I did it again,"Backstory: I have had a total of 4 relationships, if I can even call them that. They all moved different speeds and 3 of them happened 7 years ago after I deactivated with each one about a month in. I flipped my life upside down, dropped out of college, joined the military, went back to college and got a nice job and moved states. Over that period of time something changed and I wanted a relationship again and ""knew"" I could make it work this time because I have grown as a person.

Present day: I have started dating this amazing girl who loves all the same things I do, but also has some past relationship trauma and some bipolar tendencies which I found out a little later into the relationship. It's been about a month and a half since we started dating and she has moved pretty fast from anything I've dealt with which I thought was ok. I stayed over on this holiday weekend and enjoyed it all up until the last night when my thoughts started again. I met her sister after 4 weeks of dating this girl even though I was vocal that this was a lot for me. They talked while I sat back and listened and chimed in every once in a while. We had sex a few times that night which was great and everything was dandy. 

Fast forward to the morning and we do it again, but this time after we're done I'm completely silent and in my own head and at this point have completely deactivated. She notices and starts to cry and asks if I'm going to leave her too, I tell her no I'm not because I genuinely thought I wasn't and wanted to work through things together. We were happy and had sex again, and I left on a good note. On the drive back home and the hours after, the thoughts started coming back that being alone is so much nicer and she deserves so much better than myself when I can't give her my 100%. I had a break up text ready to send as I thought a month wasn't anything too serious and let it sit there without sending or deleting it.

I sent the text. She said some hateful things which I completely deserve for giving her reassurances and promises for things at the time I thought I could keep. I don't know how to process this and feel sick, guilty, selfish, a very shitty person, and more upset that she has to hurt from something I thought that I had fixed. 

I thought I was ready for a relationship, I had no idea that 7 years of working on myself was still not enough. I genuinely want this to stop. I want to seek therapy but I don't know where to begin for this kind of issue.",vrib1j,16,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vrib1j/fa_7_years_of_working_on_myself_and_i_did_it_again/,AvoidantAttachment,0
899,Low Self Worth Avoidants vs Avoidants w/ Self Worth,"I think I'm starting to pick up on patterns of avoidants with different core wounds.

For instance, I am a low self worth avoidant. This results in me avoiding situations entirely in which I need to express needs but I can't because I don't believe I'm worth it (buried subconscious thought for a long time). So basically I'm usually alone. Its a hard preference. My romantic partners tend to be secure and/or avoidant (AP partners dont' have a chance). I don't usually avoid people who have potential (I felt a connection) but its super rare (I'm asexual/aromantic as well).

On the other hand, my bff is a high self worth avoidant (she's secure but avoidant in romantic relationships). She tends to choose AP partners (avoidant partners don't have a chance) and doesn't mind spending a fair amount of time with people (she's established a relationship with) as she doesn't have issues expressing needs. She tends to avoid people with potential from the start but she's also asexual/aromantic.

It is however equally difficult for romantic prospects to gain either of our time.

Despite asexuality, neither of us have a low sex drive or are sex repulsed, just an fyi.

903,"Just discovered I am a {da}, advice appreciated.","Will try to keep this as concise as possible. 

My fiance and I have been together for 3.5 years, engaged for 1.5, wedding planned for November. 

There has always been a gap in our emotional input and intimacy efforts, with me putting in significantly less. 

I had completed very little introspection before the relationship, to me ""I just was who I was"" and that was it. As the relationship developed, introspection occurred more frequently and I learned more about myself. So the explanation for the inequality of relationship effort was first put down to a lack of emotional intelligence, and that I needed to make more effort. 

It then turned into me realizing that I just like the surface level components of relationships, not the intimacy. That I see a healthy relationship as two separate individuals with their own interests and own self fulfillment that want to be together. The fact I am a workaholic compounds a lot of things too. 

My fiance told me to Google Avoidant Attachment, and well, here I am. It makes complete sense to me now, all of the individual relationship faults and misgivings are grouped and labeled. 

There is the explained trauma in my childhood and youth, there are the failed relationships that have cemented my way of carrying myself through the day. 

My fiance wants to work through it but I have this large concern..... 

I feel like the attributes that make up my DA are foundational to me and make up who I am as a person. I have never been more comfortable within myself, as self reliant, as ""authentic"" as I feel now. I am concerned that by working on the DA, I am going to strip away a lot of what I feel makes me ""me"". I am concerned that I will be someone that I do not feel comfortable with and that I will have the self doubt issues that lead me to shape me to who I am now. 

I'm concerned that by working on my DA aspects to help fix the relationship, that the relationship may not work anyway as a result of who i may be after it. 

I don't like that my partner is feeling unloved and unfulfilled in this due to my lack of engagement. I take ownership as the reason for the faults here. But I also like who I am right now. 

Does anyone else feel like their DA is also their strength? If so, how do you maintain that strength whilst trying to create intimacy?",unz1ny,16,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/unz1ny/just_discovered_i_am_a_da_advice_appreciated/,AvoidantAttachment,0

909,{da} What are some coping strategies for when you want to push a friend away?,"Hi everyone!

 I'm new to the subreddit,but not to the topic. I'm in my late 20s and have spent some time  reading and journaling, trying to find out why I have such a hard time staying in a group of people or maintaining friendships. I've managed to open up to a few friends and family members, which feels like progress. However, and that's the thing, just telling people about the way I feel and analyzing my own reactions in a journal is very different from being in the situation where the things I said or wrote would have to be applied. 

Right now, I'm trying to get some practice with friendships. Unfortunately, I feel like I'm failing again. There is a pattern and it goes like this. 

1) I meet someone I get along with well and I think could make a good friend. 

2) I encourage them to open up to me about whatever topics they want to talk about and I get some   
support from them on mine as well. 

3) They start to see me as someone to confide in and will text me throughout the week. 

4) I stop telling them about the things that bother me because I don't want to minimize their troubles,   
which I see as greater and more valid than mine. 

5) I (very suddenly) get angry when they text me because I see it as a demand for me to stuff my own   
feelings and spend time and energy to encourage them on whatever they need help with. There is   
usually a feeling of being trapped and overwhelmed and a very strong feeling of ""(insert unsavory   
phase of your choice here)! How to I get rid of this person again? How do I get out of this?""  

I don't let them know. Usually, I will ignore their texts until the anger has died down. I feel bad about it because I am happy that they see me as a person to open up to. They deserve to talk about their feelings and receive some encouragement and I was the person who drew them out about it in the first place. I want to be the person they can trust with their feelings. 

Of course this becomes a cycle because every time I get back to them later, I make up some excuse why it took me so long to answer. Telling them the truth would invalidate their feelings and make it seem like sharing them was the wrong thing to do. I don't want that. But every time I make up an excuse, they continue to let me know more and more and every time I need longer and longer until I can react to them in a way I find appropriate. I have even made up excuses why I want them not to contact me for a while, because I need to come down for a bit. Things like ""I really want to focus on my family over the holidays, please don't contact me until New Year."" 

6) I give up, ignore the person more and more until they loose interest and if the don't I eventually   
  block them.

I feel horrible about this. I want to be there for others but when I try, I end up hurting them instead. I get really lonely but I don't see how I can change that without being a danger others. Right now I'm in stage 5 again with a new friend, and I have an excuse for ignoring them ready to go, but I don't want to start the cycle again.

910,Commitment {da} {fa},"Has anyone ever gotten to a point to where feeling of uncertainty in a long term relationship goes from…

 I am sabotaging this good relationship by pushing them away, i love them & don’t want to lose them as I figure things out, & after a good period of time & connection to..

- I don’t think I love them the same. I love them but not at the same volume. Like I don’t feel the same anymore.
- They deserve better than my uncertainty.
- I’m missing the romantic connection that I think I want.
- I owe it to myself to explore my attractions & desires that I think have changed for me. 
- I have changed throughout this relationship the last few years, I think something is missing.
- There’s so much life to live & figuring out to do & I should go do that. 

Would this be avoidance & just me detaching or deactivating & disconnecting from my partner? 

Specifically over the last year, we went from broken up (because of me) & taking months apart, coming back together to what felt to be much healthier, stronger & better communication. Lots of traveling. Intimacy & overall fun. Like having a best friend & romantic partner in one person. Everything felt much more comfortable & different, in a good way. Fast forward, around this time every year I’ve always felt disconnected from my partner, like something is missing and I should go explore (uncertainty) but I ended things this time last year & the year before (I wasn’t aware til now that there was a pattern here).  I’m feeling this way again.. like how I listed it in bullet points above. 

** I guess it is just still so hard to tell if I’ve just outgrown this relationship/person and should go explore my attractions and desires before I truly commit to a person OR if I’m just sabotaging this relationship again by creating all these justifications for the reason why I’m feeling disconnected. Because why don’t I feel the same? Shouldn’t I? After all this time, I keep going back and forth with it. 

It feels like I have dragged my partner through a rollercoaster with on and off, and I’m aware of how unfair it is. They’ve been nothing but the absolute best partner to me but I’m not sure it’s what I want. I went from wanting to move to a house with them from our small apartment, to suddenly maybe I feel like I’ve been hiding & I don’t think I want to commit to this because I’m unsure & now I think maybe I just am not attracted to them romantically anymore.",tnj6xq,16,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tnj6xq/commitment_da_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
911,How can you tell the difference between being avoidant with someone you like and not liking someone? {da},"Hi! To start i should note that i dont really know what the abbreviations in the {} mean, but im pretty sure da is dismissive avoidant which is why thats there. EDIT: i figured it out! Da is wrong, im fearful avoidant! 

With that said, I’ve (F20) been really struggling with this topic. Every time someone gets mildly close to me or i can sense them starting to like me or note that they make me happy, i immediately get deeply uncomfortable and distance myself. 

Ive been trying to work on this even though i dont really know how. I cant force myself not to feel uncomfortable, but a relationship that becomes progressively more uncomfortable for me as it continues doesnt seem like a very good option either. Because of this, I usually end up lying and making excuses as to why its not going to work. I pick out tiny things that i see as “red flags” or ill find reasons why i think things wont work out and ill use this as a justification for finding a way out of the relationship. Even when im aware that im doing it i dont really know how to stop myself. 

All that in mind, i can never tell if im withdrawing from someone because emotionally intimacy is deeply uncomfortable for me, or if i really am just not interested in that person. Its different from person to person but i was curious if anyone else thinks about this and if so if anyone had any tips for being able to tell?

913,What's just happened? My first breakup from my dismissive side {fa},"I met the man of my dreams 3 months ago, securely attached, zero red or orange flags and lots of green ones, and an incredible connection, the best I've ever experienced. Great communication, solid trust, no arguments or tension, raw honesty. I deactivated quite fast as the relationship was moving too quickly, but I set boundaries and he respected them. When I was with him I'd be so into him, when apart I'd dread seeing him. I couldn't properly attach and felt smothered by him liking me.

  
Unfortunately, I continued to deactivate and tried push through as I could see what I was losing, but I couldn't come back from it. I assume it was because he was emotionally available. I was in fight or flight and losing interest for weeks, while he fell in love quickly. I've never been in love and I've realised that I need to do some serious EMDR and therapy before I am able to, as I have serious walls up. 

 I ended the relationship over the weekend, and he is utterly heartbroken, and gutted over the lost opportunity. Despite understanding I lost what could be the love of my life if I was secure, I don't really feel that upset, while he is in tears, unable to eat, sleep etc. Normal heartbreak. 

I feel so guilty at how I feel completely unattached, and broke someone's heart despite knowing I had everything I wanted in a man and more. Has anyone experienced this? I've only leaned DA once before and that was only for a few dates so not used to this experience. 

Will my sadness hit me at some point after some emotional distance?

915,Always attracted to partner’s friends/ other people,"Hi there. I (f20)(DA) have recently started seeing someone (m20)(Secure). As an avoidant I’m having heaps of internal issues and what not but most of the time I can recognise what I’m doing as deactivating or distancing etc. 

However, the other day I went to the person I’m seeing’s house for a gathering and a bunch of his friends were there. I found myself attracted to some of his friends and I couldn’t help comparing him with his friends. As I did, I found myself focusing on his flaws and was increasing put off by the idea of dating him. 

This is not the first time such a thing has happened to me. I want to know if other avoidants struggle with comparing their partner to other people/ being attracted to other people. I can’t tell if I’m genuinely unattracted to my partner now or if my brain is just looking for reasons to leave. I feel like I will always look for someone better no matter who I end up with and I want to stop. Any advice/ similar situations?

916,Spiraling/Urge to Reach Out,"Posted this in the DA sub, I'd like as much support as possible so I am posting here as well. 

I need to vent somewhere, I thought that I was growing and becoming more secure and now I feel like I'm pedaling backwards so fast and I can't see where I'm going.

For more context you are welcome to read my old posts.

For the bare minimum, please read on :)

Close to half a year ago I created a post about a difficult break up I was going through (we'd casually dated for a year) that I had initiated because, simply put, I wanted more and he didn’t.

He'd invited me to a 3 day trip abroad which prompted me to realize we needed to go forward or end things. So I told him we needed to talk. He freaked out and put up hard walls - and then *I* freaked out and put up some of my own.

After avoiding the conversation I told him I wouldn’t accept him putting our conversation off and that we either talked, or that I'd just tell him over the phone. He begrudgingly cleared his evening and we sat down to chat for the first time in a year about how we felt.

He gave me the whole 'I'm not built for relationships, something is wrong with me, I'm not a romantic person and I'll end up alone' speech. During which, he admitted he had romantic feelings for me - which surprised me and I admitted the same. We were both quick to add that we weren't 'in love', rather that we just had 'romantic feelings and loved each other as people'. We agreed we'd be a good couple, yada yada. We noted that we were very special in each others lives. Yes, I can read my own words and I do realize we were both just tragically stupid.

Fast forward a month or so, I made another post trying to understand the depth of my romantic feelings for him because at the time, I wasn’t sure. I had repressed them to such an extent that I wasn’t sure they even existed. It took another few months to realize how much I cared.

Then I made another post because he reached out indirectly through Instagram a few times and then when I confronted him in a secure manner he gave me a bullshit reply saying he'd been thinking of me and was sending me 'good energy' but didn’t mean to hurt me. I was furious because he was insulting my intelligence and so I told him that it was unfair to reach out if he had nothing to say because I had *explicitly* asked for no contact (including socials, I made him unfollow me and I unfollowed him etc) and did not get a reply.

This time, he respected my wishes, and hasn’t reached out again. Now that my anger has subsided, it's driving me absolutely insane that he has indeed, *respected my wishes.*

Since I broke it off, I have avoided every single place that I could possibly bump into him at. I am petrified of seeing him. I have completely ghosted any and every area/club we went to together.

Ironically, I found a once in a lifetime opportunity, cheap, gorgeous apartment a few minutes walk from the beach in the city center through an old friend at the perfect time because I was apartment hunting. For context, I live in one of the most expensive cities in the planet and it's damn near impossible to find a normal apartment here, let alone in the price range/location I found.

Literally the ONLY downside? It's 100 meters from his apartment.

Sigh. I couldn’t make this shit up if I tried.

Of course I took it, I would have been completely out of my mind if I didn’t. It did take some consideration because I was in every sense of the word, petrified. My friends told me if I didn't, they would. So I did.

To conclude, I am feeling like complete and utter shit as of late.

So much so, that this week I almost went to a party where I knew his friends would be at (I knew them as well, they were really great and we got along and they couldn’t understand why we weren’t together) to *indirectly* get myself on his radar. I didn’t want to fully commit to seeing him.

Then I was like 'Well that's stupid, you might as well just text him and ask him out for coffee and be done with it' but then I shut that down and told myself that it was a ridiculous situation.

He's 30 years old for fucks sake. If all he can do is reach out indirectly through *likes* on Instagram where we don’t follow each other, then he obviously isn't ready for more. Whatever 'more' means.

Back to the point - why, after nearly half a year, do I suddenly have this BURNING urge to text him? Hell, I was like 'We could just sit down and have a chat as friends'. Yeah, 2 people who have romantic feelings and sexual attraction for one another can definitely do that. The rationalizations go on and on.

I get over people quickly. I don't get the urge to reach out. Hell, I barely initiate when I AM in a relationship. I certainly didn’t initiate when we were going out.

So why, am I feeling so, so sad about this suddenly? It's not like the past 5 months were great. Obviously it was really hard. But these past 2 months are even worse than it was in the beginning.

Is it the dreaded half year mark? Is this when my avoidant ass is starting to see shit through rose-colored glasses and ignore all the flaws? I was doing that before, but its just so much worse.

Is there finally enough distance between us for me to start to miss him so much that I'm willing to dismiss any potential consequences?

So to those who have gone through something similar, how the hell do you get past the urge to reach out? I'm obviously going to see him eventually (I do live basically next door to the guy now) and I am scared to fucking death.

I feel like I am spiraling. I really miss him but my ego has gone through enough and if he would want more, he'd reach out. I don’t know how to get through this, I'm kind of surprised at the level of my emotions.

I'm internally backtracking and my mind is going 'Fuck being Secure!'

But I don't really enjoy this feeling. I'm not really seeing the point of not letting myself hermit. I feel like if I do, I will need to communicate my current state to others which was ""forgotten"" about or in my perspective, not understood/respected.

A few of you guys mentioned whether or not my relationships were worth maintaining in my last couple posts and I argued that some were. But now I'm not so sure...

Right now, I do not want to text people back promptly (this has little do with my reddit interactions as I often come here to unwind, lol). It is draining me. I want my space to be respected. I wanna be by myself damnit.

919,What is your main source of validation?,"I had a conversation with u/kyondayo where she asked what my boyfriend's main source of validation in life is. That maybe he's hyperfocused on that source of validation and that hyperfocus makes it seem like he's not as invested in our relationship. At the moment, I believe his main source is his son. 

It got me thinking - what is my main source of validation in life? And I realized that it's my boyfriend. I've done a lot of healing and don't seek validation from him as much, but spending time with him and interacting with him is what makes me feel safe and normal to be myself. I don't really get a lot of validation from my job - I work hard, but not because I'm trying to prove something. More because I'm just good at what I do. It's not really recognized much, and I don't do anything I do for the recognition. My mom is my only consistent family relationship right now. She can be critical of my parenting and very invalidating of my feelings. Just overall makes me feel useless. 

I get some validation from my kids, but I frequently feel like I'm failing or not being a good enough parent. So it's more like instant validation and then quickly dissipates. 

With this realization that my boyfriend is my main source of validation, I know I need to start intentionally seeking validation elsewhere as well. I am definitely hyper-focused on him, and I wonder if this is something he can somehow sense, and it puts invisible pressure on him.

923,I don't get why I have an avoidant attachment style,"**Upbringing**: I have a good relationship with my mother, I don't feel abandoned by her or anything, she's my best friend. My dad travelled to another country for work when I was in elementary, but I know he did it to be able to provide for us and that he cares for me. We eventually moved to the country he works in when I was in middle school and then my mom, brother and I moved back to my birth country in time for high school and he stayed there. I do remember when he first said he was going I told myself I wouldn't miss him because I wouldn't get attached, I don't remember a lot of things but I remember that. \[I also remember the year 1999 became 2000 when he carried me on his shoulders in the middle of downtown and we counted down to the new millennium. I was three. I can't even remember things that well when I was 4 but I remember that.\]

**Dating/Relationships:** It's funny because the one guy I fell for, ended up living in another country and I could've fallen for anyone who lived near me but I chose him, I couldn't deal with the distance. I didn't like how much I liked him, but couldn't depend on him due to distance and I usually don't care and I'm great with long-distance. I usually don't even care to be around anyone that long, I didn't care about any of my boyfriends, and didn't miss them. For once, I actually wanted to be close to someone and I couldn't. The same thing with my friends, I always had to make friends with the exchange students and people from outside of the country and I'd be alone when they graduated and left. I didn't miss them or anything either, I'd just make new friends. However, it's like I'm addicted to this dynamic.

924,Does anyone else get very easily irritated with friends and have a history of conflict in friendships? Curious if this is a Fearful Avoidant thing,"Looking back, I definitely have a long history of getting really irritated with friends, having it out, reconciling. I know it’s a normal thing to go through as a human being, but I’m pretty sure it’s a bit pronounced in my life. I have pretty bad social anxiety because of it (or vice versa) and typically hold in my anger now and distance instead, where I would usually be pretty confrontational growing up. 

This strategy doesn’t exactly work well- I’m still angry, but instead of letting it blow my relationship up in a confrontation I ruminate and have imaginary fights in my mind all the time.",q8imrz,15,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/q8imrz/does_anyone_else_get_very_easily_irritated_with/,AvoidantAttachment,0
925,Letting your guard down and someone in. What I did. What have you done lately or want to do?,"I previously posted about hardly ever crying having difficulty doing it in front of others. Well, last night I was watching a show it upset me. The character was told that when your child needs you you just say yes. They then did something to help their child. As I am totally DA with my parent who are not there for me I started crying a little bit Perhaps due to me thinking about it often these days and wanting to find a way to deal with them. 

My partner was sat next to me not paying attention to the show and didn’t know why I was upset. It wasn’t a long or massive cry. I may need more practice hahaha. He just held me and told me it was fine and to let it out. We cuddled for a bit. 

We discussed why I cried. He says he sometimes cries everyone does. Of course he’s right and I know this. Crying elicits a response in people that makes them want to help the other person. I’ve never seen my parents cry. Well, my Mom once but she was coming off anaesthesia that didn’t agree with her. Once an Ex told me ‘Don’t, cry, don’t I hate it’ while they held me and I took it literally and never cried again in that relationship or asked them about it. They probably didn’t mean it literally. They didn’t comfort me like I wanted and I should have expressed that need that looking back I was ashamed of having. 

The thoughts in our heads cloud reality. We all want to be seen, known and loved. Usually the worst fears we have and coping mechanisms are actually worse than communicating or in my case crying. Being vulnerable, asking for help is normal and actually makes bonds stronger.

929,Am I an avoidant? Or just protecting myself?,"I am a mix bag of emotions at the moment 😕 I want to have a talk with the guy I have been dating.
Not sure if I fall under *avoidant* or just a person protecting my heart. The 8 months we have been dating he has been kind, consistent and considerate. He has told me he loved me, and appreciates me. Those things he are saying on his own volition. But a part of me sometimes feels like it's a hidden agenda.
I have a one foot in & one foot out the door type of attitude. It feels like I'm protecting myself. If I have to split, or it makes it easier and I am less attatched if he has to split.. But I also feel like it can be avoidant behavior. It's like I have actually visualized myself breaking things off. Or him breaking it off. Or just in general like he is waiting for something *better* to come along. 

Because all my past relationships were bad.  *I overinvested* with the wrong person, they basically just felt like relationships where I was used. 
And I am trying to avoid that at all cost.

And although it's nothing present that signifies this is about to end. I just feel like it hasn't happened yet.
I feel like avoiding the conversation because I already know how this is going to end. 
But having a talk will help solve 2 issues for me. It's a start for me where I am confronting something that I should be facing so I can deal with the reality. It feels like I am running from myself. 
And 2 I will learn where I stand once and for all.

931,DA ex not telling mutual friends he broke up with me? (AP),"So my DA partner of 7 years broke up with me almost 7 weeks ago, but he apparently hasn't told his best friend.

His best friend and his girlfriend invited us over to their house to watch a movie in the group chat that we normally use for catch ups last night and I can tell from the casual wording that he has no idea what happened. Now I'm wondering if he's even told his family. The last I spoke to him which was a couple weeks after the break up he said he hadn't told anyone. 

Why would he not tell anyone after this long? Is it because he's so avoidant that he's literally avoiding everything that makes him uncomfortable to such an extreme? It was incredibly awkward for me since I've been NC since week two. I saw that my ex was online and saw the message but neither of us replied.

 I'm preparing a statement to send to the friends separately, this is what I'm going to send ""Hey just letting you guys know in case he hasn't told you, that K broke up with me about a month ago. As you can imagine at the moment I'm just needing some time to heal but I'd still like to be friends with you both if you are open to it.""

932,Avoidantly attached and afraid of intimacy or possibly asexual?,"Hello fellow humans,

Have any of you struggled to find an answer to the question as to whether you are avoidantly attached and/or afraid of intimacy (and all the complexity that comes with that for whatever reason) or actually asexual? 

I have battled this thought for a very long time. I'm not sure if the things that I struggle with in the intimacy domain (in combination with my avoidant nature) have made me paralyzed to the point that I have become very reluctant to initiating or being interested in sex, or I am actually mostly asexual. I have a complex family and personal history too, and generally have not really enjoyed sex in the past. My introduction to love/sex was probably not the best. Sex has always been an issue in the few relationships I've had as well, which I feel has mostly exacerbated my issues. I often deactivate when physical intimacy intensifies, and feel too much ""in my head"" when I should be in a 'feeling' state.

I could obviously write a lot more, but would be very curious to find out whether other avoidants share similar experiences.

936,Need advice dealing with a DA who keeps pulling away and coming back,"Hey all,

I’ve been seeing this guy for around 4 months. The first 6 weeks of our relationship were amazing - he was present, affectionate, and overall made for a great partner. We decided to be exclusive relatively fast (2 weeks of knowing each other), and leading up to becoming official we discussed how we were pretty much already there. I asked him to be my boyfriend at the 6 week mark, and he responded with “I thought I was already your boyfriend.” Needless to say, once we officially put a label on things, he pulled away (I called him out on this, and he said he has a long history of doing this) and 2 weeks later dumped me over text. It legitimately felt like he flipped a switch. This was the first time.

A week or so after this happened (and after briefly meeting to exchange things), he sent me a super long text explaining himself and that he was a “fucked up person.” We ultimately rekindled things to an extent (without a label), and during this time he acknowledged his commitment issues and that I’d need to be patient with him. Even though we didn’t have a label, he still discussed future plans and legitimately treated me like his boyfriend. This lasted about a month before he started pulling away again. I tried to act blasé about it, but eventually I called him out. He ended up sending another pretty rude text saying he “didn’t owe me an explanation” and that “we were never back together” despite the fact he treated me like we were. He also said he saw no “sexual or romantic future” with me. This was the second time he “switched” and pulled away.

A few days after this, he initiates small talk via text. This lasted about a week until he finally brought up how I was on dating apps and seemed annoyed. He mentioned wanting something sexual (which was confusing, given that previous text) and I told him we’d need to have a discussion prior to exploring that given what he said. This ended up with him completely opening up, acknowledging that at times his feelings for me are “overwhelming” and he wants to be with me 24/7, and at other times he makes himself feel “trapped” and pulls away. He ended up coming over that night, we had sex, and then he started talking as if things were back to the way they were (e.g. mentioned being my partner in the future).

After this, our texts are back with substance discussing future plans and what not. This lasted a few days, and after a night of exchanging good night texts/talking about semi-deep things, he pulled away again (reduced effort in communication, not responding, etc.). This is the third time he pulled away, and he only lasted 3 days.

Since this. We’ve communicated very little. He sent me a post on instagram of a quote mentioning how having the “lowest expectations is what brings happiness.” I responded by saying “I guess my expectations aren’t low enough.” He hasn’t responded and remains pulled away, but assuming he repeats his patterns he will eventually come back.

This whole thing is a rollercoaster and I don’t know how to proceed. I can’t justify cutting him out of my life, but I can’t keep being reeled in and dismissed. Once we start getting close he just decides to pull away. I just miss the guy I dated for the first 6 weeks, and since then, it’s been a rollercoaster. Any advice on how I should proceed in this situation? I’d greatly appreciate if.",mlb4lw,16,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/mlb4lw/need_advice_dealing_with_a_da_who_keeps_pulling/,AvoidantAttachment,0
937,Am I bored...?,"Hello fellow Avoidants,

I, a strongly dismissive avoidant, am having issues in a current...situationship? I'm going to keep this short and sweet, although I have a tendency to waffle...bear with!

**Background:**

I (F22) have been seeing this guy (M25), lets call him JimBob, for round about 3 months. He first appraoched me in October 2020 asking for my number, but I told him I was seeing someone so therefore I can't give him my number. We settled on exchanging social media. He would still ask me out via social media/want to arrange walks/work together on a particular project despite me letting him explicitily know that I am seeing someone.

Anyway, I stopped seeing the person I was seeing and I began to get friendlier with JimBob. We eventually arranged a walk at the end of Dec 2020 (COVID restrictions), and we have been seeing each other (including sex)/communicating regulary ever since (now April 1, 2021). 

&#x200B;

**The situation at hand:**

Being avoidant (but actively working to be less so), I frequently activate and deactivate when it comes to him. With the help of this incredibly insightful community, I realized that I usually deactivate because one of my needs aren't being met/a boundary being crossed. This was a real moment of realization, the realization that I have needs?! Crazy! But when I do deactivate, I do try to now zone in and realize why I am deactivating and what need is not being met. However, we spent some time together today and I've left deactivated, without really knowing why? As much as I do try to zone in on my feelings...? At first, I feel that he may have crossed one of my boundaries of 'letting me be me'. We went out for a run, and he was (not in a mean way) pressuring me to pick up the pace and keep going. He was supportive and not at all rude, but I felt like I was letting him down and he was seeing my imperfections (absolute sore spot for me). Anyway, we spent the rest of the afternoon together, there was no problems. We've gotten to a stage where we joke about meeting each other parents/friends, joke about going on vacation together, discuss summer plans. He also told me about a minor health issue that he said he was too embarassed to tell me about before. He is definitely consistent, if I was to call him right now, I know he'd answer. If I was to breakdown in the middle of the road, I know he'd come to my assitance...consistency is a major think DAs need (IMO), so why am I deactivating?

The other day, he did a really kind act of service for me (my primary love language), albeit it wasn't on purpose but he still saved me a lot of hassle. I was sooooooo activated, but now I've done a complete 180 and now I'm on the verge of deactivation.

&#x200B;

My question is, am I bored because I don't have a 'spark' that I have had with other insecure relationships? I came out of a long stint with an FA, which was incredibly unhealthy, but there was 100% more of a spark. I know people say the spark is anxiety, but gosh...I kind of miss it! I like JimBob, I do, there really aren't any red flags...and the sex is amazing, lol. JimBob and I haven't had the DTR convo yet, because I think COVID has made us slow the pace down a lot as there are limited things we can do beyond going round each other's places. I am most definitely not ready to DTR...in fact...I'm ready to end it. A lot of me purely can't be bothered to be in a relationship because I, unfortunately, see relationships as a lot of work. I guess I am just seeking the perspective of other avoidants and how you've coped with the 3-month mark and the itch to run....because oh Lord, so much of me is telling me to end it all because being alone means that I won't have to be on Reddit typing that at midnight...lol.

Am I appealing to my avoidance if I end it, or could I actually not have feelings for him?

P.S He seems secure, slightly leaning avoidant.

Edit: I just had a sudden realization. I recently told my friends and a sibling about him. They are now know his name and ask about him. This could be what is giving me cold feet as I never usually tell people about who I’m seeing due to the embarrassment of abandonment. Think this may just be me over psychoanalysing myself and I just don’t like the guy? Damn, I wish I was more in tune with my feelings.

938,She's leaving tomorrow,"I'm so confused.
Weve been living together for almost 4 years, and share 3 children. The first half of our relationship was amazing, we literally did not fight at all. And of course Life happens, I'm not exactly sure what I did or what happened but I definitely know that there was a period of time where things had switched. 

She's been leaning out for the better part of a year. She would disconnect from me, shut down sometimes for days, sometimes weeks at a time. She would often sleep on the couch or in another room. If she was in the same bed as me she still felt disconnected, distant. We would go through periods where there was no physical or intimate connection. It felt like the cold shoulder, the silent treatment. And it's been an emotional roller coaster, it's almost like we would break up and then fall back in love with each other over and over again. I remember she was this way in the very beginning it was very hard to get close to her. Took her very long time to let her guard down. 

I finally gave up and suggested separation. This has been a revolving conversation on how she needs time and space for a while now. It's hard for us to talk about things like this. But she has ways of checking on me, and I'm sure she's reading this now.
And that's ok. I get it now.

 I took it personal the whole time thinking that she was punishing me. Now I know that she comes from a place of fear.

I'm sorry that I wasn't able to help her.
I'm not mad, I don't hate her. I still love her.
All I wanted was her, but now she very well might be gone forever.

I wanted to write this post with an intention to understand Avoidants in much more detail and how to go through the challenges to make sure the relationship thrives. I would appreciate if avoidants can tell exactly what they need to feel safe and behaviours that help them to feel loved and understood. how do you people like to text, what type of conversation you people want, what reassurances you require. people with successful relationships with avoidants are also most welcome to contribute. 

I've seen so many posts and comments hating on avoidants and just advising them to avoid them altogether and it saddens me. it's not their fault that their fears are getting the better of them and i just feel we should really try and empathize with them. avoidants are genuine and kindest of people and I really believe once they feel safe, they can give a lot to the relationship. I really like the strategies for partners section in freetoattach.com but it would help all of us a lot if we can get a more concrete idea on how to go about it.

942,{FA} How to stop being serious and tense and learn to find balance in life,"Hello guys, 
In the recent past I (FA, F, 28) have received feedback from several people around me that I seem very serious and unrelaxed. As a child and teenager I was very uninhibited and felt a lot of lightness in my life, but in the last few years I have experienced a lot of adversity, matured as a person, learned about AT, and gone through two therapies. All of these experiences have made me more serious, more self-reflective, and have led to me becoming more thoughtful and calm overall.

I have a hard time finding a good balance between seriousness and lightness. I think this is also because I put a lot of pressure on myself, wanting to be a good person and craving a sense of control because I'm afraid of what might happen if I let go.

I’m more interested in deeper topics such as AT, childhood development, True Crime and Buddhism and this too reinforces the perception on the outside that I’m a serious person. 

Are there other FAs who have had this feedback here as well? And how do you deal with it? How do you find balance between seriousness and lightness? 

Because FAs tend to be known for wanting deep connections, digging deep into topics and sometimes becoming to focused on healing themselves, maybe forgetting about other more lighthearted topics.",14pcu03,15,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/14pcu03/fa_how_to_stop_being_serious_and_tense_and_learn/,AvoidantAttachment,0

A big part of my issues are linked either to shutting down or being overwhelmed by an intense stress that has no name (is it sadness ? Is it fear ?). In other words, I am struggling to connect with my “deeper” emotions. 
Questions here : have journaling been able to help you to connect with your emotions ? Has it been able to help you identifying them and sorting them out ? What questions are you asking yourself when introspecting and writing ? 

Alternately, is there any other kind of technique or self-help tool that you could advice ?

949,{DA} Day to day activities to soothe anxiety,"Yesterday I went on a first date with this girl. It went really well, she seems smart, creative and open minded and we had a nice conversation. I'd like to go on a second date and get to know her better.

However, my usual avoidant anxiety kicked in very fast after the date. This low-level fear has been with me since yesterday and it's making me feel unnerved, I just want to run away, lock myself in my room and shut down.

I've been in psychodynamic therapy for around 4-5 years now and we're working on my emotional connection problems. Since I found out I am avoidant I've been trying to look inward and do more individual work myself as well. However, I know it will take quite some time to fix those issues and this is where my question comes in - is there anything I can do right now to maybe lower my anxiety in the meantime so I don't lose my mind and don't sabotage my dating?",y1yf8g,15,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/y1yf8g/da_day_to_day_activities_to_soothe_anxiety/,AvoidantAttachment,0

952,{FA} Is losing sexual interest deactivating too?,"I'm (FA) looking back at my relationships over the years trying to find patterns to learn more about myself, and how to notice my own deactivation so that I can handle relationships better in the future. I remember a fight with someone I cared deeply for and they made a comment that now has me questioning my own motives from my last relationships. 

Me: ""I guess I was just an ego boost for you to sleep with and then immediately lose interest for.""

ExFWB: ""If it was an ego boost then we never would've stopped sleeping together."" 

This baffled me at first until I started looking back at older interactions of my own. I went through a lot of trauma as a kid and used hook-ups with people I was never attracted to as a form of self-harm. Now I'm questioning how much deactivation played a role in my sexual life, because I'm known to immediately leave those I've felt repulsed by.",wlvyb8,14,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wlvyb8/fa_is_losing_sexual_interest_deactivating_too/,AvoidantAttachment,0
953,{fa} shutting down people you want to open up,"TLDR: I unintentionally shut down people when they try to open up, even if it's something I want them to do because I can't process my own emotions in the moment.

My ex who I'm pretty sure is also FA (constantly switching back and forth from ""don't ever leave me"" to not sure he wanted a relationship) tried opening up to me this weekend and I shut him down without realizing it. 

The sad thing is that I want him to be able to open up to me. I can allow him to share and be vulnerable when it's not about me (family, work, etc.) or sometimes when it's about me and I'm prepared. This time it was about me and I was caught off guard, so my reaction was to make a joke and lighten the mood. He immediately called me out and I apologized, but damage done...I didn't give him a safe space. 

I don't have a problem with other people's emotions. I have a problem with my own. I've learned to notice when I'm feeling deactivated around people that I know I care about because I've had time to sit and process my feelings for them, so when I feel numb or the need to run I remind myself that I do really care, but sometimes I'm still either coming off cold/distant or end up shutting people out.

How do I learn to be more in the moment when it takes me so long to process what I'm feeling?",wjiyyi,15,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/wjiyyi/fa_shutting_down_people_you_want_to_open_up/,AvoidantAttachment,0
954,{FA} Trying to understand needs,"Hi folks! So the title might not be the clearest ,but basically I realized I struggle to understand what it means to have needs wrt others/ partner: ie a lot of AT quizzes have this kind of thing ""I do not feel as if I need anything from my romantic partner or loved ones, it can be difficult to conceptualize how others would meet a lot of my needs"". (This is from Thais Gibson's AT Quiz) .


I honestly feel baffled by it, as I realized I tend to overgive also because I have a hard time knowing what I would even need , which leads to unbalance.
I mean anything related to a relationship is not a ""need"" because you can live just fine without a relationship. I know what I like and don't like in a relationship (up to a point), but I can manage just fine by myself (it's a lot easier !)

My brain seems to have a hard time grasping it at all, which feels weird .
Then again I also have only recently started to understand the needs that I have ""by myself"".

955,{FA} expressing need for emotional connection before sex,"For years, I had a hard time enjoying sex because I was scared to get attached and suppressed my needs, leaving me detached and constantly feeling abandoned. I finally had an amazing date where we clicked very well, and it was the best sexual experience ever. I felt so safe, comfortable, and excited to do it again, whereas with others I feel pressured, rejected, and used after. 

If I’m interested (with most), I end up feeling embarrassed to even show emotions after because it’s “too early”. Hooking up and letting them know I’m interested in getting to know them (not making it official right away, but just going on dates vs fwb) scares them. 

I’m interested in sex early on, but it’s a requirement that I want meaningful sex and enjoy the person I’m talking to also to continue seeing them - otherwise I feel nothing and have 0 sex drive (I think I’m demisexual). I know bringing up dating right after I hookup with someone may seem too intense too fast, but how do I ensure I still state my boundaries for enjoyable sex?",vz9c5d,15,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vz9c5d/fa_expressing_need_for_emotional_connection/,AvoidantAttachment,0
956,{FA} and very done with humans but longing for connection,"I am FA, also had a very serious issue happen this last year that has put me in a very weird place emotionally. I’m stuck in a vortex of wanting connections, sometimes intense and deep but then I’ll notice if things get obligatory or expected, I just can’t even lift myself to call, send the text or stop by. Even if I love the person. I can’t do it. It hasn’t always been this way, it felt like it was a situation in the making where I was so loving, always available, would only ignore some phone calls. Now it’s every phone call. It’s almost every text, it’s like the conversation has to be chosen for me to allow it. How do I help this? It feels like a level of burn out but I’ve been like this for a couple of years with this last year being the absolute worst. I even had a boss who I ghosted because he screamed at me after he shut his office door behind himself after he innocently called me in  to discuss a “calendar issue,” but he lied and humiliated me about a conversation with a client he wasn’t a part of and after that I couldn’t even lift myself to walk into my office again. He’d call and I would just say “yes” to every request, knowing I was done. To be fair I told him after he yelled at me I wanted to ethically resign and he started begging me to stay and not being assertive I told him I’d think about it. However I knew after the second he started yelling I was done. I just couldn’t handle him anymore as a human. And I’ve never felt more relieved to be away from a human but I’m afraid if I don’t start learning grace for others, I might be very alone. He seems so hurt..? He couldn’t understand why what he has done was unacceptable. Anyways, how do you start to know human interaction is safe?

958,{fa} so tired of the internal rollercoaster ! (vent),"Hi folks !
I have been learning about at for around a year now, after the breakup with my da ex of 12 years (and 3 kids..) 

I am FA , leaning avoidant according to most tests, although given my anxiety levels I am not sure.

Some background :
In the past year, in addition to dealing with the fallout from the separation

- I have been facing my core wounds
- the bucket loads of trauma, some of wich I had repressed
- dealing with my own share of responsibility in the breakdown of the relationship (protest behaviors for the anxious side plus sometimes brutal deactivation from my DA side, I was always more DA than AA except for this relationship)
- continuing therapy (now completely healed from depression, so I can focus on attachment issues, yeah )

I met someone recently (was not looking, was really surprised but very into it ) and I went from somewhat secure (felt really stable, neither cold nor clingy), to avoidant (huge ""eek, she is interested"" , but that did not last, as I recognized it as a form of deactivation, and ignored it), and things went really well until I felt feelings start to develop...

And now it is ups and downs in my head all the time, it seems like my anxious and avoidant sides are triggering each other to insane levels !
I am actually aware of most of the internal processes, triggers, boundary issues and needs now, so that is a big plus ,but it does not reduce the pain of the perpetual flip flop !

when does it get any easier ?

How the hell do you express coherent needs and boundaries if they keep changing ?

I want to heal, I do not want to mess things up , but the shear pain (I clearly view it as pure , mostly irrational fear now), makes me want to shutdown, run so I cannot be hurt, mostly by my own up and downs...and also never giving someone the power to hurt me again...

Ironically it seems my newfound awareness of things has increased the intensity of the yoyo ...
Sigh , thanks for reading my rant , cheers.",uu8ryo,15,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/uu8ryo/fa_so_tired_of_the_internal_rollercoaster_vent/,AvoidantAttachment,0
959,progress !! + uncovering my fears {fa},"today marks my 3-day streak of not deactivating, despite being shown and having been shown immense affection to/from someone! i'm really proud of myself because for the past few weeks i've been in this repeating cycle of showing/receiving affection -> going to sleep -> waking up with intense deactivation.

i think how i've begun to control my deactivation tendencies was through talking with the person i'm involved with . i realised that i have this huge fear of ""doing the wrong thing"".

growing up, it's always been instilled in me that being in an r / s is frowned upon, especially when you're still schooling and are technically not an adult yet. as a result, i have always kind of looked down on young people who get into r / s, as i view them as impulsive and insincere. after all, schooling is supposed to be their utmost priority BEFORE they can think about securing a stable future with their partner, right?

after i've noticed this deep-rooted fear of mine, i started to assure myself that there's nothing wrong with loving and being loved. i'm just doing what makes me happy and i * want * myself to be happy. me being involved with someone isn't anything that harms others or the planet.

also, people's needs change. yes we may not stay together in the future, but right now this is something i both want and need.

I don't wanna be tooo happy about my progress yet, because it's only been 3 days. but i hope someone who relates to this can realise that it's okay to let someone in",upzg3q,16,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/upzg3q/progress_uncovering_my_fears_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
960,{DA} {FA}What is it like to have a SO that had a healthy childhood/healthy family vs a SO with childhood trauma/dysfunctional family?,"I feel I cannot be with someone who has lived such a different reality to me, I want my partner to have similar severity of trauma as me and worked towards a similar healing level. The lack of understanding from people is deeply isolating and hurtful. But then I also see that most people who have had similar levels of trauma to me, are horrible unhealed abusers. 

Then I have met people (who I don't know enough about to determine their trauma level), but I know they have had a good family and perfect secure parenting, and they have treated me well but I can't stand the difference between me and them. I can't stand how much I feel I havto explain or how much pain I experience by myself.

So I'm curious about others expections and experiences.

962,A work conflict that was better than therapy {fa},"It has been a while since I posted a progress update. 

Since March 2021 I have been in therapy for childhood neglect and PTSD sustained in childhood and adulthood from abusive situations. I have been doing schematherapy and EMDR. 

I decided to go back to therapy after I moved in with my DA boyfriend, and this turned out to be a major trigger for us both. My DA boyfriend is still pretty much the same as he was. Easy to give up, easy to shoot in denial, easy to hide and gaslight himself he cannot change. It hasn't bothered me because I can distinguish myself from him emotionally. Even if he denies loving me, I still call him ""dear"" and say ""I love you"". I use my FA hypervigilance to see more of the truth, and the truth I see is that he loves me so much it scares him. 

I have done therapy while working fulltime and finishing my masterthesis with independent research - all together at once - while having unresolved tension with my DA boyfriend. It has been quite tiring. 

Something happened at work. I got a new colleague who I could see had some loneliness and self-confidence issues, so my FA-ass first nature was to be extra nice to her. On the 1st of March I was hanging up posters to support the Ukraine in our office building. I had told her that me and my DA are quite emotional about the war because we both have a family history in the WWII that affected us. She did not say much to soothe me. Instead, she aggressively pulled out her phone and asked me if I knew about a group, and showed me an advertisement photo from her phone. It turned out to be a militant fascist group. I was upset and told her I want nothing to do with fascism. She got red in her face, bit her lip and snarled at me. Like she was personally offended by me saying no to fascism and her physical cues were she wanted to attack me. I did not think too much about the incident, but a week later she told a secret about me to someone else and embarrassed me in an aggressive way. Then she told half-truths full lies to my boss, so that I would get an e-mail from him to discuss if I am doing OK, and I had to explain more embarrassing details about myself during that conversation. She also purposefully kept me out of the loop on work, and went on vacation herself, so that I had to deal with all the ad-hoc problems she had created for me. It triggered a panic attack on the 20th of March for me and I have since been at home in sick-leave. 

In the weeks prior to my sick-leave, my whole body was hurting and I would need 2 hours after work to lie on the couch zoned out if I had any motivation to cook for myself at all. My cat was so stressed about it, that he peed on all my stuff and was lying on my chest shivering together with me. 

I have since written a report on her behavior and showed it to the company health & safety officer, the company confidant and the company lawyer. I have had to force my boss to make social safety at work discussable. He was clearly so affected in his own imago that he tried to silence me, but I forced it with HR present. 

I told my DA in a fit of anger ""I have been sleeping, but I am rising from the dead!""

That is how it has felt like. The fact that I had been so hurt by my colleague and my boss, has made me only increase how much respect and love I have for myself. I have started to value myself at twice the salary I currently receive. I don't truly plan on ever going back to the same position. I applied for a position in the company at two times the rate and got invited to the interview. It only confirmed to me that I am worth it. That I am too good for this atmosphere. My doctor, psychotherapist and psychiatric (I needed to take medication to deal with the stress) have all concluded that this job and the interaction with my colleague have triggered my PTSD and that it would be better for me to move on. 

I plan to stay in sick-leave for as long I can stretch it. I actually want to demand that they let me stay in sick-leave while I search for a new job. I have started to apply for positions with a minimum 1k more than I earn currently. 

My motto is: ""adversity is my stepping stone to greater things"". I am applying it full on in this situation. Comparative to how down in the dumps I have been, I truly feel that this poop situation has only given me my confidence and voice back. My cat seems OK again, I feel OK again, and better yet - I have all the motivation to make positive change for myself in life & career.

964,{fa} is my quirk related to my attachment style?,"I have a weird slightly embarrassing quirk in that I love reading but I struggle to finish my favourite books. I have a bookcases of books I’ve loved with the bookmark still in a chapter or 2 from the end.

I read somewhere (maybe it was on free to attach) that avoidant types feel comforted by characters (book/film/game) bc we can safely attach to them without feeling the threat of enmeshment.

965,rescue fantasies {fa}," I think I have some form of victim complex and been fantasizing since childhood about someone taking care of me, rescuing me, or just seeing me in my pain and listening. I uncovered some childhood trauma last year which caused me stress and since then those thoughts are playing pretty much in a constant loop, even after I shared my experiences and have people listening to me. Part of me feels that nobody ever sees and understands me fully and is there for me how I would need it, I always look for something but dont know what it is. Except that Im very lonely,  I been isolating a lot because of mental stress and dont really have someone in town. So now I decided to push myself and seek out new connections, but part of me feels that no amount of attention and care can fill that longing and void, and that Im too empty to fill it myself. Most of the time I dont feel like doing anything except comfort things in bed. I picked up drawing as a new hobby and try to build consistency, but still feels that Im rather existing than living. Most of the time I feel demotivated or anxious about my future. I just want to understand the pattern of self-pity and longing for a rescuer, because its so destructive but very compulsive.

966,{fa} I'm just about to turn 40. Never been in a relationship. I wish to change but damn it's difficult.,"Making this post short is going to be difficult lol. Suffice it to say I've struggled with my mental health most of my life. I'm sure there are multiple labels that I would fit and have been scared of (OCD, depressive, anxious, codependent, probably more) but I'm not very interested in labels or diagnoses but instead how to change. I was an insanely late bloomer and grew up in quite a smothering and controlling though loving household. I didn't move out till I was 32 and it didn't even occur to me to explore romance till a few years later. I always assumed it just wasn't in the cards for me, too awkward etc. I can see too I was long a very immature victimy kind of forever alone type of guy, ugly bullshit I wish to drop.  


I've only dated a few people but I know a pattern when I see one. I seem to only pick safe people who I know have shown interest in me rather than go after people I myself may be interested in. My mind immediately starts furiously checking for red flags before I even know the person at all. I quite like said person regardless of whatever red flags I'm seeing and I can technically see that my brain just wants to ""keep me safe"". Intimacy starts to develop and the anxiety levels ratchet up to 11. I choose to run away before anything serious can really develop. Usually 3 or 4 dates in. I've tried to retain friendships with some people I've dated, though to be honest more out of feelings of guilt and shame than anything else. All of these experiences serve only as further fuel for the narrative I carry around with me that I'm a dangerous person who hurts people and need to stay away, that I'm broken, etc etc poor pity party me lol. This spiral can be ugly and I don't like it as it's pretty damn selfish and it's not really about the other person even though my brain seems to throw me that as a reason to cover it up.  


As I've done more work, therapy, tried to grow as much as I can and to love myself I think I can see the real me. I'm an intelligent complex individual with a lot to offer, but someone with some pretty deep attachment and other childhood wounds who is absolutely terrified of intimacy. I'm far from ""dangerous"" as my brain likes to bullshit me, but I'm certainly prone to hurting people as I try to avoid getting hurt or ironically trying to avoid hurting others lol. This doesn't make a bad person but it's certainly something I wish to change. I suppose the easiest start is simply to stop running and stick around for the natural consequences of the development of a relationship. That would seem to be the very thing I want after all lol. I suspect this is hardly the end of the work or the pain though.",tg1cut,15,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/tg1cut/fa_im_just_about_to_turn_40_never_been_in_a/,AvoidantAttachment,0

968,How much longer do I have to try? I'm really tired {da},"Hi! I'm writing here because I feel like I'm at my wits end. I need advice.

I (25 F) have been seeing someone (24 M) for a few months (>3 months). We became ""officially in a relationship"" a while back. However, the issue is that I have not felt excited to meet or talk to him since after our 3rd date when things started getting more serious, and especially not after the relationship became official. Over time, I actually started feeling nauseous or irritated when he would ask to meet. I started feeling the ""ick"" over little behaviours of his and whenever I agreed on a date, I would feel extremely resentful in the period leading up to the date as I would feel that I was being ""forced"" to give away my time when I would rather be doing something else. However, I usually feel better about the relationship after the date if things go ok. Eventually, I wondered if the ""happiness"" I felt afterwards was actually relief from the date being over and that I was able to accomplish something ""normal"".

I have always known that I have issues establishing romantic relationships as I would be interested in someone at the start but after meeting a few times and them returning the interest, I start feeling the ""ick"" and would become annoyed at their requests to spend time together. Recently, I discovered that I was probably ""dismissive avoidant"". I am extremely emotionally independent and do great being alone.

While this realization was able to help me understand my feelings better, it has also made me confused as now I'm not able to tell if 1) I just am not attracted to him romantically so I should end the relationship or 2) It's just my avoidant tendencies acting up and I have to continue to try to overcome them. We do have quite a lot of things in common and he has nice qualities overall that I would look for in a partner. I know for sure that I was attracted to him at the beginning.

The only reason I agreed to become ""official"" and forced myself to continue this relationship until now is because I assumed that I am dealing with case 2). I keep thinking that, knowing that I am DA, I am just not trying hard enough to overcome my mental barriers or giving it enough time. I do not want to regret potentially giving up a good relationship or hurting him because of my own issues so I told myself I would ""try"" and give it more time. However, it has been a few months of stress/anxiety and forcing myself to do things I do not naturally want to do and I still feel sick at the thought of spending time together, when we do not even meet very frequently (once every 1-2 weeks, I cannot even imagine meeting more often than this). I do not think this is how someone should feel about a person they call their girlfriend/boyfriend and I'm really tired. I also know it is not fair to my partner and will hurt him even more to drag out this relationship because he deserves someone who is equally invested in the relationship. So, I need to know- Do I just not like him that way, or is it my avoidant tendencies? When would I have done enough to try before I can let go knowing that I did my best? How much longer? Is there a point in talking to them about this when it's not really anything they are doing that is causing me to feel this way? Why can't I just be like other people and be head over heels for their partner? ):

I know it won't be that easy to give me an answer but I would love to hear if anyone has any advice or thoughts on this.",t1tvcs,15,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/t1tvcs/how_much_longer_do_i_have_to_try_im_really_tired/,AvoidantAttachment,0
969,"Followed through with wanting to be alone. Now I am very alone, what to do? {da}","I(23f) was living with my partner's family(24m) two weeks ago but always had this guilt of having to rely on them, wanting to start my life over completely alone and distancing myself from everyone I know. Anyways, I actually followed through with these feelings and now I live alone and am struggling with actually being independent and have just been surviving day to day.  
I told my mom that I had moved out, and that if she could help come visit me because I am realizing how terribly difficult it is with how little I actually prepared. She then tells me how proud she is of me. For a moment, I was very glad, then I thought: Fuck Me. Because I followed through with this toxic mentality my mom had instilled in me from years of neglect and abandonment and now I had abandoned my previous life because of it.

970,What are some common sense balancing acts you struggle with?,"I'm trying to make a list of mine to bring up in therapy and would be happy to hear others' since I might not be aware of/remember everything. Some examples:

When you stop being closed off, not understanding what you can share when, and with who. I never had a problem with oversharing, but I have difficulty understanding how to be authentic without doing too much self disclosure with new connections. I guess setting the pace?

Identifying red flags vs. justifications for avoidance/paranoia/distrust/unrealistically high standards. Is this person displaying red flags or am I being too unforgiving and reading too much into it?

Emotional openness vs. dumping your feelings on your partner. Extra difficult if your emotions can be unhealthy and potentially hurtful to your partner because of attachment issues.

Putting effort into connections vs. knowing when to actually leave (I guess ties into No2 a bit).

Trusting your partner while at the same time distrusting them enough to keep an eye on red flags????

971,Help - suggestions for how to find an attachment theory-informed therapist that works with avoidants,"Does anybody have tips on finding a therapist that works  heavily with attachment theory rather than just lists it in their profile of a billion other modalities?  
I've read the books.  Heard the podcasts.  I've heard about Thais Gibson but haven't taken her courses (willing to try if it's legit helpful).  Talked about it. Thought about it.  Cried about it.  Tried to ""get it"" and ""relationship harder"", and change patterns with minor success, yet here we are....

I'm fearful avoidant, resistant to therapy (been in and out for several years), have severe commitment issues, and no longer trust my judgement based upon my last and current relationships.  Namely knowing what's a legit relationship concern vs what's trauma reactive, vs what's ""merely my avoidance talking"".

I'm long past burnt out about it and have been not addressing it because it feels daunting and disempowering.

I want to be in a healthy and secure functioning relationship, but past experience tells me I have zero clue how to do that in practice despite the awareness I've gained.  


I don't know how to approach this any longer in a way that at least empowers me to tell the difference between avoidant patterns, real concerns, and some deeper maladapted trauma response.

973,A life of avoidance,"I did write in here before when I was on another relationship. I need to say, first of all, I'm tired. I'm so, so, so frustrated.

Throughout all of my life the same pattern happened to me, SEVERAL times. Actually, with every single person I got slightly close to. Some of them were friends, tho I need to say, the intensity of it resides in romantic relationships.

The pattern is:

- I need love and I crave for a connection/relationship

- I meet someone

- My mind starts to spam me with thoughts like ""this is not your person, get out"". Or with feelings of repulsion, specially if this person is too affectionate.

- it becomes overwhelming and I break up with them/end my friendship.

It's almost like a recipe. That happened to me for around 10 years. 

Now I'm on a relationship of a month and a half and I'm fleeing again. This time, a mindful attuned guy who actually likes me and takes care of me (which makes the avoidance pattern light in red). I feel like I want to break up, I just can't quite get if I really like him or not (as I ever did before). 

I feel like ""this is it"". I'm doomed craving for love for the rest of my life but never getting it or never accepting it.

This relationship feels like it has such good potential. But apparently I'll ruin everything cause he is ""too loving"". 

I just realized, I've been pushing everyone away to some degree - my friends, my family, my partners.

975,What does a “secure” breakup look like?,"Been seeing a lot of good stuff about the avoidant  way to end a relationship; I definitely can relate as I’ve had many relationships end that way. It’s usually relief or “out of sight out of mind.” The reason things ended was usually because I felt engulfed or otherwise trapped. Occasionally it’s been purely out of deactivation which can lead to considerable regret.



I imagine an anxious preoccupied breakup can involve a lot of obsessing and prolonged heartbreak. Do APs initiate breakups?  Perhaps if they’re not getting their needs met. In my experience the relationship nearing an end makes them grip on tighter and it’s been up to me to end things. 



The question for me is: What is the secure attachment way to end a relationship? Is it always amicable? What are secure reasons for ending a relationship? How would someone who is recovering from an avoidant attachment style differentiate a “legitimate” reason to break up from deactivation? I feel like part of aiming towards healthier relationships is knowing when and how to end them in a healthy way.",r7i46l,13,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/r7i46l/what_does_a_secure_breakup_look_like/,AvoidantAttachment,0

979,I'm an extreme avoidant,"I'm in my mid 20s, F. I had little maternal warmth growing up and feel like I'm extremely avoidant. I just learned avoidant attachment was a thing from the internet a couple months ago and realized it sounded just like me. I've never been in an actual relationship because whenever things start to get emotional or physical, I run. I have a hard time with physical touch, too much focus on me, expressing emotions, all of it. I have very healthy friendships where I don't act this way.

I started seeing a guy a few weeks ago. He checked off a lot of boxes for me, but I'm having a hard time with all of the above issues. I kind of think he could be anxious attachment, but it's just a theory. I feel like it's especially hard because I'm at a really happy point of being single right now (have a great place of my own, loving my job, and being busy and fulfilled) and honestly feel like I don't need a relationship. But I think I may just be telling myself that because it's my instinct to avoid.

I also feel like I could see the relationship going somewhere but I would need way more time than the average person. And maybe I would never get to that level and then I would have just wasted his time. He's never been in a relationship either.

Now when I (rarely) share with someone-like send a link to an article I think they might find interesting and they're polite about it but clearly not interested I feel enormous amount of shame and want to withdraw. Big time.
I understand I can't expect from others to be always enthusiastic about everything, especially when they have their own lives but it's what I always try to do for them, which makes me feel even worse.

981,Avoidant Attachment is so fascinating,"I used to have an avoidant attachment style. And I can say it had so many positives. I felt generally independent and free from the group! Like I could take any decision even if the majority doesn’t agree with it without feeling ashamed. I felt free like I could think and act for my own. Like I only belonged to myself.

As I grew, went through things.. my attachment style changed into a more anxious insecure ambivalent attachment. I became needier, clingier, more codependent and fearful. I lost this independence and can’t breathe  without my groups validation.

I currently have an avoidant friend. His actions used to trigger me so much. But when I started understanding him, I realized that he is plain fascinating. He’s relying on himself. It’s excessive but the self is the most reliable in my opinion. When I started reading about avoidant attachment, I feel safer around him now. I don’t feel confused with his ambivalence and fear of closeness. I just remember it has so many positives. In essence.. like Miley Cyrus.. I was born to run I don’t belong to anyone.

984,"Self Sabotage, Protest Behavior, and Deactivation","So I recently tested and came up secure in all relationships except my dad (no relationship there at all so makes sense). But I'm realizing that just because it's easier for me to behave securely, I still have the underlying fearful-avoidant traits. 

I have been completely spiraling today, and I realize it's because I am self sabotaging my relationship. I think we recently moved from the power struggle phase to the stability phase. It's only been a couple of weeks, but it's been really amazing. My partner (avoidant of some kind, unsure whether DA or FA leaning DA) has been opening up more and saying more things that indicate commitment to me. 

But here I am, free falling into the abyss because I don't feel safe in stability. I feel safe in chaos. So therefore I am creating chaos. I recognize this, and now I feel such guilt and shame. I'm flipping and flopping between wanting to use protest behavior to get my partner's attention and wanting to deactivate and stop communication altogether. 

What it boils down to is that I don't know how to just let things be good. I don't know how to lean in to happiness and let things happen naturally. I'm definitely more self aware than him, and so being able to recognize his deactivation is adding a layer of stress as well. ""Did he not say he loves me because he fell asleep, because he stopped loving me, or because he's deactivating?""

Truly what I want to do is talk about all of this with my partner, but I know that will be a lot for him. I can't even figure out how to securely ask for some reassurance from him at this point. Any suggestions on how I could begin a dialogue in a secure way? 

\*\*I think I should add that this is probably tailing off of me asking him if I could come over last night and him telling me no, that he was tired. The secure part of my brain knows this is valid and respects that he communicated. The FA part of my brain immediately went to 'he always says no when you want to come over, everything is on his timeline which means that he's using you, he'll never want anything more than what's convenient for him, your needs don't matter, etc.' Sometimes I feel exactly like this - like I'm actively 2 different people, one who can behave securely on the outside and one who is a hot mess of FA on the inside. We coexist in chaos.

TL;DR - I am self sabotaging because my relationship is going really well. I want to be able to share this with my avoidant partner without overwhelming him.

But, All due respect does anyone know of any sub Reddit’s or social media platforms or even resources that are for Avoidants and do not have a ton of anxious people posting for advice on how to deal with avoidants?

I’m fearful avoidant and it’s so triggering to me to see AA and AP complain or asking a ton of questions (I’m sorry it just is triggering for me as irrational as it may sound ).  I know I have things to fix and deal with but I can barely scroll through any groups or sub Reddit’s without hearing how avoidants are always the problem and it honestly makes me want to avoid (imagine that) lol and not even bother trying to change. 

If I have to read one more post of “don’t even bother dating an avoidant” I’ll lose my mind because I have abandonment issues and people saying don’t even bother with them makes me feel like my fear is confirmed that no one wants to deal with me long term. When that fear is activated well so is my avoidance lol. 

I think people don’t realize A LOT of avoidants have just as much as anxiety as AP and AA they just cope with that anxiety by clamming you and shutting down.

991,Am I isolating or am I valid in ending a friendship? {da} {fa},"So some time ago I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/11el2wv/why_is_it_that_i_have_to_work_on_me_and_not_the/) post (read for context), and a lot of people were very supportive and gave me good advice. The conclusion was either to set hard boundaries with the person or end the friendship.

Yesterday I had a really good talk with my friend where I sat some boundaries and here's what we decided:

* She's going to stop saying things like ""I would kms if you died/left me."" She expressed that it was a way to tell me that she valued me a lot, but that's she's a grown-up and her reactions to things are her responsibility, and if I ever needed to leave, she would get extremly depressed, but she would not end her life. She also apologized for the jokes about killing my friends, in a way to say that she dislikes them, and said that of course she could see why that would make me uncomfortable, and she will never make jokes like that again.
* We will have to agree to disagree on the ""Promise me not to leave"" thing. She needs me to promise that, but she also acknowledges that she knows it's an unrealistic thing to ask, but she is going to feel somewhat insecure about our friendship, but that she doesn't want me to violate my own boundaries to meet her needs.
* She did acknowledge that she needs to work on her trust issues, but that I also need to work on my commitment issues, which is valid.

We had all in all a really good chat, and basically all of my boundaries were respected.

Why do I still feel drained in the friendship though? Why do I still want to leave?

I read through my journals and I've been wanting to leave for years, but I was afraid of her reaction, and now she's said that her reactions are her responsibility, all my boundaries are met, and we are working on our friendship in a healthy way.

Why is it that I don't feel better? Why is it that I just want the friendship to end?

Secretly (I know it's bad), I hoped my boundaries were deal-breakers to her, and that she would want the friendship to end.

The worst part is, that I love her so much and she's the only person who's ever understood me, and she's the one I want to share things with, but I'm just so fucking tired in this friendship. And I don't think I have a valid reason to be.

Everything is fine and I still feel like crap.

Am I isolating or avoiding or is it valid to end a friendship over the fact that you're simply just drained?

Or am I drained because my brain wants to avoid but I won't let it? Am I manipulating myself?

I'm so confused.

Things about me/the sitiuation that might be relevant:

* I'm autistic, she's BPD
* I have a hard time knowing what's right and wrong because my social awareness isn't the best.
* If I feel hurt, threatened or unsafe, my main instinct is to freeze and dissasociate
* We have been friends for a little over 3 years
* She describes us a life partners, but I don't have the heart to correct her and say best friends
* She's always the first to say I love you/you're my soul mate/let's be together forever, since my feelings for other people simply has a hard time reaching that level of love
* I have been manipulated and used a lot in the past as people often find out that I'm pretty naive and I take what people say at face value, which has left me being very cautious and avoidant because I simply don't know when people are being toxic or I am just being sensitive.",11ly8b5,14,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/11ly8b5/am_i_isolating_or_am_i_valid_in_ending_a/,AvoidantAttachment,0
992,{fa} I used to lean ap leaning now I’ve switched to da and idk how to manage it,"My partner (also fa) and I have been together 10 months now. In most of my past relationships I’ve been ap leaning, the few that have been da haven’t lasted long. This relationship has been pretty tumultuous from the beginning, first I had big icks then got past those lots of tiny arguments or disagreements but we have been able to sort them out. The thing that still happens from time to time is just this anxious avoidant trap behavior. He’s self conscious, I get extra critical, he needs more from me, I feel like I’m physically wading through sand when I try to hear him out.
We both are pretty dedicated towards healing. He usually eventually takes accountability and comes back in a seemingly more grounded place.
This time I feel a little more sus though, wondering if this grounded version I see is a subconscious tactic to manipulate me to keep me around (I know how it goes to be ap leaning). Tbh I’m pretty fucking tired of not being able to trust any of my instincts first as ap now as da. 
This post has kinda turned into a rant but I am also here to look for coping strategies for when I’m in a da place. All I really have strategies for is ap behavior.

994,Anyone struggle to be a kind and warm person in the early stages of knowing someone? {FA},"Recently noticing that with my absolute best friends, I am big on acts of kindness and words of affirmation, but thinking of how to make their day better does not naturally come to me. I am always excited to hang out with someone, but I don’t naturally think to initiate the meetup. I’m not always asking someone about their day or how they felt about things, but value the friendship so deeply because of what they’ve done for me.

I vividly remember being a kid and always abandoned in friends groups, left behind, and not invited to things. It made me stop overextending myself to people, giving them gifts, and showering them in compliments. I stopped planning things because no one would come or I didn’t have the means to make it happen. I grew up in a very strict household and could rarely invite people over, drive people places, etc. very much had to rely on other people for things.

 I think I over corrected so badly that I now come off as a bit selfish, even though I genuinely don’t realize it - im now reflecting after taking a personality test. Im not thinking about someone’s well being, how their day went, or little things to make someone day better - not out of malice, but it doesn’t come naturally at all. If im with someone, I will offer them snacks, be a good host, and care for them, but im extremely out of sight out of mind. 

I used to get annoyed when dates would text me every day asking about my day and trying to have small talk (me thinking I’ll get attached easily or they are expecting too much of my time), but now I realize they genuinely want to chat. Coworkers enjoy me coming up to them for a conversation. 

Has anyone realized this in themselves? I think my friendships are very deep, but it feels slightly imbalanced where I receive more than I give. Not all, but some. In newer relationships, I definitely give less because of how I was rejected in the past and am fearful of coming off as “too intense”.",ycs87q,15,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ycs87q/anyone_struggle_to_be_a_kind_and_warm_person_in/,AvoidantAttachment,0
995,Dealing with {FA} guilt,"The girl I am dating has expressed that in times when she felt connected and I was deactivated, it made her feel like her feelings didn’t mean anything.

I let her know that when we both felt connected and close, I felt really happy too. And I was being honest! The best beautiful moments we shared together felt sweet and happy and genuine and loving to me as they did for her.

But now I am feeling pretty deactivated (for the past couple of weeks). I can see and feel that she’s feeling close and connected to me, and I am struggling to find that same feeling in myself. I am trying not to pull away, but also trying not to “fake it”, which would make me feel disingenuous.

Now I feel this guilt about being with her. I feel like if she knew how I was feeling, she’d feel invalidated. I keep hoping I will find a way to reconnect and feel close again. In fact, it’s likely that that will happen soon. I usually deactivate for a week or two and just when I feel totally aloof and unconcerned about it all, I reconnect. 

I feel like this would be a bad time to bring this all up. She’s in the middle of studying for a huge test. She’s struggling hard with burnout and I do not want to add to her burden.

Second, we’re going on a fun trip together very soon and I would hate to cause a bunch of drama and confusion right before that. Maybe I will reconnect, and make the most of the trip without having to have a big talk.

Any advice? I know this is sort of relationship advice but I am curious as to how you all handle talking to your partners about this without hurting feelings.

Tl;dr: I feel guilty when my partner seems to be feeling close but I feel distant. The timing to talk about this is really bad right now. What to do?",xnvfky,12,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/xnvfky/dealing_with_fa_guilt/,AvoidantAttachment,0
996,Phantom ex - what do you tell people about them? {da},"{DA} For those of you who have a phantom ex, what do you do if people ask? My current gf of almost 2 years asked about my feelings for my ex wife. 

Truthfully- I deactivated hard with my ex and didn’t give her or the relationship a chance when that happened. She was blindsided. Through it all, she continues to be an AMAZING mom to our girls and i can’t help but be impressed with how she’s kept her shit together for them. It’s hard to compare anyone to the mother of your kids. 

I of course like my gf, but she thinks the reason she hasn’t met my family is because they like my ex wife. She feels I have unresolved feelings. (She also knew and was friends with my ex)

997,Feeling obligated to stay to ‘improve’ {fa},"I feel like sometimes I try to force my self to ‘stick it through til the end’ with people I try to date. Largely because I’ve been trying to work on healing my attachment system. To me that looks like questioning if I’m running because of my avoidance or if it’s not a good match. I’ve noticed I do that with people I don’t necessarily like but not with the ones I actually develop feelings/crushes on. I’d love to hear if any others feel like they do this too? 

I did realize this behavior recently though with a situationship that I tried to rekindle and ended up getting politely rejected (which I wouldn’t normally do but I ran into them recently after a long break and it was a nice chat so I shot my shot). Normally I would feel really upset and offended and like I should try to do something to reverse it and then bottle up the feelings, but this time I felt calm and not ‘detached’ necessarily but just like ok and stable to move on. 

All that to say I think I’m learning there’s a difference between avoidance and just letting things go? I don’t think I knew the difference until what I mentioned above. And I guess I’m appreciative of my ability to know when to end things amicably instead of trying to force myself to ‘fix’ myself…",16aobgo,11,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/16aobgo/feeling_obligated_to_stay_to_improve_fa/,AvoidantAttachment,0
998,{DA} whining about the predicament I put myself in,"I think I'm just writing this out to vent a bit, I'm not sure. I'm just tired, and frustrated with people, and I feel like I'm learning the unfortunate lesson to stop making new connections.

[Two months ago I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/ukmhg3/da_whats_the_best_way_to_coursecorrect_without/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about falling into a troublesome and taxing situationship with an AP person who has a plot in the same community garden as me, who wanted to keep escalating things. That wasn't what I wanted, but I was hesitant to cut things off entirely because I felt like it was regressive behavior.

Well, I didn't cut things off or run away at first. I tried modeling what I thought was Good Friend behavior. Besides goodbye hugs, I stopped all other physical contact, but continued letting them reach out to talk with me in person and on the phone. In this space of time, they had a somewhat serious death in their family, became suicidal, and also started losing friends. The lattermost seemed almost intentional. They got into some explosive fights with close friends and didn't see the point in salvaging the relationships. I knew, as soon as they told me that, that they were increasingly relying on me to meet their emotional needs/desires, and I also knew they had so little self-awareness at that point that they didn't realize this themself. I got so scared that I was becoming their only support figure, but also scared that they'd hurt themself if I tried to opt out, so I didn't communicate my boundaries or state my need for space like the commenters of my first post recommended. I felt trapped. Meanwhile, I was avoiding the garden so I wouldn't run into them, which was effectively caving into avoidant behavior and running away.

But circumstances inevitably change. They seemed to be stabilizing somewhat, and I was getting progressively worse (family, work, and societal issues making life rough). They aren't a big texter, but one day sent me a super long text philosophizing about their loneliness after smoking weed and that was just it for me. I replied respectfully, basically saying I didn't have the capacity to engage or support them at the time. They told me it hurt a lot to hear that, but they admired me asserting my boundaries. That was about 3 weeks ago; I haven't seen or heard from them since.

This maybe sounds like a celebratory post, but all of it is a total drag. I'm still giving into my avoidant tendencies, and it has left me feeling like I lost one of the most important things in my life currently. I loved spending time at my garden plot more than I loved spending time with any person I know, but my anxiety over running into them is so strong that it's just destroyed that sentiment entirely. I drive to the garden daily but don't even get out of my car, or spend a few minutes checking on plants with my heart pounding from near-panic. They also borrowed clothes and still have one of my favorite shirts (petty to care about this, I know). I'm resigned to never get it back because I'd feel like an ass to ask for it.

So I'm just, agh. I'm lamenting these things and regretting having opened up to someone in the first place. I know that ""don't be friendly, don't make new friends, don't let others close"" is not the right lesson to learn here. But that's what it's feeling like.",vw1x8o,10,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/vw1x8o/da_whining_about_the_predicament_i_put_myself_in/,AvoidantAttachment,0
999,Is everyone capable of feeling romantic love? {FA} {DA},"I’m 26F. I’m not sure I’ve ever experienced true romantic love. I’ve mostly had casual relationships before where I never developed deeper feelings. I’ve also had a few romantic relationships lasting ~6 months. I never came close to feeling in love. 

The only person I think I may have started to feel love for was an ex I was with for a year. However, I only really felt strongly when we were physically together which was only once a week or fortnight. Between visits I’d feel pretty detached from him. I lean DA but he was definitely more avoidant than me. So I feel like my feelings were very driven by anxiety too in that relationship. 

I read all the time on here and elsewhere about people being so in love with their partners. Like being so excited and gushing over them and being kind of soppy. Even lots of avoidant people on here talking about how much they love their partner. 

I just can’t relate to that feeling. I just feel like I don’t feel strong positive emotions or strong attachment aside from for my parents (but my mum was very hot and cold and died when I was a kid and my dad was always very unavailable so these def weren’t secure relationships). 

Idk it just makes me feel like maybe my attachment style is too screwed up and now I can’t feel love like most others do. I enjoy time with my friends and can feel close to them but at the same time feel detached and wouldn’t really mind if we just phased out of contact. I just… don’t really care. As bad as that sounds. 

So it made me wonder whether it’s possible for everyone to fall in love? Or not? Can anyone here relate to never really feeling romantic love?",umuyo6,7,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantAttachment/comments/umuyo6/is_everyone_capable_of_feeling_romantic_love_fa_da/,AvoidantAttachment,0
0,Be a Magnet (not a rope),"I think as anxiously attached individuals, we have a tendency to try to keep our partners close with rope-like tactics. We have certain boundaries for closeness, and when our partner tries to stray outside of our boundaries we attempt to pull them back in with protest behaviors that act as a rope. The thing is, nobody wants to be roped in or tied down. Sounds painful. And also, you don't want to have to be the one pulling the rope on the other end! What a tiring way to live. 

Better to be a magnet. Be your best self. The version of you that's charming and loving and caring and kind, but also has their own life going on that's appealing and attractive. Then when your partner starts to get a little too far away, they might realize on their own, and get pulled back in by their desire to be with us. This is a partnership driven by desire and connection instead of obligation and fear. But it requires a willingness to let them go. If your magnet isn't strong enough or isn't the polarity needed to keep your partner in orbit, so be it, keep increasing the strength of your magnet until the right one connects.",l4ytpk,986,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/l4ytpk/be_a_magnet_not_a_rope/,AnxiousAttachment,1
1,"I’m dating someone secure, here’s the biggest differences I’ve noticed","1. Things moved a lot slower. She has very clear boundaries and treated me strictly as a friend until she was sure she had romantic feelings for me. There was no love bombing, which made the verbal displays of affection mean a lot more to me when we started dating.  
2. She *wants* to know what my needs are and *never* makes me feel like they are too much. For example, she knows my abandonment wound is triggered when I don’t know when I will hear from her or see her next, so she always lets me know even if it’s as simple as “hey, I’ll call you when I’m off work. Miss you 😘🥰.”  
3. One of the biggest differences is I’m a lot less anxious because her behavior always lets me know she still cares about me. But when I am triggered and get sad, she lets me know that she values me and likes me as we talk through it.  
4. There is no toxic jealousy or controlling behavior. As she puts it “if someone is going to cheat on me, it’s going to happen whether or not I act jealous.”  
5. She is emotionally available. She loves talking about how she is feeling, sharing her needs and wants. This has made me feel comfortable doing the same for her, and has removed so much stress from the guess work of how to support each other.  
6. Consistency- this is a huge one. Who she is and how well she treats me doesn’t change regardless of her mood or schedule or my mood.  
7.  We don’t “fight,” we communicate until clarification is reached. There’s no keeping score, intentionally trying to get back at each other, or punishments. Only conversations like “when ___ happened, I felt like___. Going forward, can you___?” And even these conversations are rare because we both know and respect each other’s needs, wants, and triggers.  
  
I was single for six years in back to back situationships with avoidant people before I met her. I can honestly say that it was worth every day of waiting. I’m committed to being the best partner I can be and fully appreciating her, but even if this doesn’t work out (it’s still fairly new at six months), it has been so healing to see that I am loveable and my anxious needs are EASY to meet for someone who is truly interested & secure.",w48ys5,657,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/w48ys5/im_dating_someone_secure_heres_the_biggest/,AnxiousAttachment,1

11,"I went for a walk and had the most sudden, intense realization about myself.","I won't let myself be loved.

That's it. That's literally my problem. As much as I freak out when I feel like people don't like me, even though all I thought I wanted was to be loved, I've been inventing bullshit excuses for why the people in my life that love me don't REALLY love me. They only love me out of a sense of duty, or because they're lonely, or because they pity me, or because they need me for their own emotional support. As much as I cling to people for reassurance that they love me, I don't believe them. I never have. And it's all another freaking coping mechanism, because if I let myself really believe someone loves me then they have the power to hurt me if that love ever goes away.

13,Stop trying to figure out your avoidant ex.,"Their attachment style doesn't matter. No answer as to why the breakup happened or what you could have done differently will ever be satisfactory. What you really want is for the outcome to be different. Going down the rabbit hole of attachment theory will only cause you to further doubt and blame yourself by bringing up the what if scenarios had you recognized their avoidance sooner and taken a different course of action. None of that matters now. Their traumas are their own to deal with, just as your anxiety is your own cross to bear. 

This person chose to walk away from you and no longer have you in their life. They continue to wake up every day choosing not to contact you or reconcile. Give them exactly what they want and let them live with the consequences of your absence. You probably did everything you possibly could to save the relationship and they still discarded you. Who cares what their reasons are? Past traumas notwithstanding, most people are capable of rational thought and can recognize when someone is good to them. If that's what tipped them over the edge, then clearly that's not the person for you. They're not capable of sustaining meaningful relationships unless they heal. Sadly, most of them don't. 

Start showing up for yourself and stop wasting precious time and energy on people who only hurt you or see you as an option. That's the most important step in working towards a secure attachment style and attracting someone you truly deserve. Leave your avoidant in the past where they belong and focus on building a fulfilling life for yourself. I still cry over my avoidant ex long after our breakup, but I know one day she'll be all but a distant memory when I've finally healed. Keep going.

18,The trash will take itself out,"I am secure and had someone ask me a really great question the other day. 

The question was ""How do you find other secure attached people when dating?""

This question is really important because the dating pool is full of avoidants that are not doing the work and are just moving from one casual relationship to the next. They meet up, they give 100% for 3-6 months, the sex is great, and then they start to exhibit avoidant behaviors. 

In my history in the beginning of dating avoidants, they will try to test me to see what they can get away with. Once they realize I can't be manipulated and my line is drawn in the sand with zero tolerance for foolishness they pull away. This is also a game. They are use to the AP/AA dynamic where they will be chased. It never comes to fruition. I let them go. I know my worth and my self esteem is very high. This confuses them and they either come back around acting like nothing happened or they disappear never to be heard from again, which I prefer. The ones that do come back are promptly shut down if I discover no self help has been taken part of such as therapy. 

I do not allow them to play with me or occupy any space in my life if they have not done the work. 

Once the trash takes itself out then I am left with fellow secures, avoidants working on themselves, or even AP working on themselves that will garner my time and attention in the dating pool.

Having high self esteem for yourself is an avoidant's kryptonite. They will recognize you can't be fiddled with and move to the next who will play the game for years with nothing to show for it. Stand up for yourself and watch how quickly they pull back and disappear.",w74nir,345,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/w74nir/the_trash_will_take_itself_out/,AnxiousAttachment,1

22,A Short Dating Guide to Identifying Avoidant Attachment Early from a Former Avoidant,"A common question on this subreddit often comes from anxiously attached people who have put large amounts of their time and energy into dating avoidants only to be blindsided with a unilateral and undiscussed breakup: *How can I avoid this happening again? What are the early signs?*

In my early 20s, I had a fairly severe fearful avoidant attachment and so I am pretty personally familiar with common behaviors of people with intimacy fears. I've been secure for many years now and am currently in a healthy relationship with a fellow secure partner, only after a lot of time spent searching, reflecting, and growing.

**So that said, here are some of the strategies I used to filter for secures back when I was in the online dating pool, within one or two dates:**

1.  Ask new dates about their relationship with their family. This is the number one sign of unhealed attachment issues and is well documented in all research literature. If a date has a very obviously toxic family, it is highly likely they are fearfully avoidant (disorganized strategy to maintain safety). On the flipside, if their parents seem very nice but are overbearing and don't give them space and autonomy, they are likely dismissively avoidant (projects all intimacy as an attempt to control them). 
2. Ask about their relationship history. A history of short flings with little breaks in between, situationships, lack of any relationships, an unhealthy attraction to someone unavailable to them, and any other maladaptive relationship dynamics is nearly a sure sign as well. Especially a history of breakups and getting back together or unhealthy levels of current intimate contact with past ex-partners. This shows a desire for some connection, but without the obligation and consistency that actually builds the foundation for true intimacy.
3.  Unusual behavior around replying to texts. Avoidants use personal space as a way to regulate their emotions/affect. Because of this, they cannot be available at times they are self-regulating to reply to texts. Most secures I've known, including myself, tend to see texts as casual and easy to reply to quickly. Even to the point secures may struggle to understand why avoidants see texting as so constricting and obligating when it only takes 20 seconds out of their day occasionally.
4. Counterintuitively, you should come on stronger. Avoidant individuals prefer partners that seem disinterested or uninvested early. The feelings of being trapped only begin to show once they realize you are highly interested and are looking for future commitment. Anxious individuals often downplay their attachment anxiety early on and attune their needs to match their partner's. As a secure, when I was dating, most avoidants walked away from me quickly once they saw I was emotionally engaged and expected commitment within 4-6 weeks or so.

As a former fearful avoidant individual, I engaged in all four of these behaviors quite regularly and all of them acted as a barrier to finding a healthy relationship. This includes other minor signs like workaholism, substance abuse, and idealization of independence. It was only once I started taking responsibility for my behaviors and seeking out people who made me feel emotionally uncomfortable and flighty, *and stuck with them anyway,* that I finally started to heal. And this goes for all attachment styles. Everyone heals on their own terms.

So I do hope anyone in the dating pool with anxious attachment could find this guide useful. And for those of you exiting traumatic relationships, I hope you can at least get some level of catharsis from reading about things you may have personally experienced yourself but couldn't necessarily put words to.",scki3c,328,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/scki3c/a_short_dating_guide_to_identifying_avoidant/,AnxiousAttachment,1
23,My DA ex came back and I rejected him,"I got dumped by a DA in July. We’d been together 7 months and he totally blindsided me. I was beyond devastated; I couldn’t get out of bed, I was broken and I ended up going to a therapist. I also went no contact immediately after the breakup. 

Earlier this week, I reached out to my ex as I realised a pair of my shoes were still at his. I literally just wanted my shoes back and felt pretty confident at the idea of meeting him as I’ve been trying my hardest to heal. 

We met up Saturday. I got my shoes and we went for a coffee. It seemed like this was goodbye for real and it ended on a pleasant note. When I got home, he messaged me saying he wanted to meet up again. He was being really flirty and said he would be up for ‘seeing where things go’. 

Thankfully, I’ve read enough Reddit posts to know this is textbook avoidant. They come back, but they’ll leave again and you’ll feel twice as hurt. 
I shut down the messaging and said I don’t want to revisit the past, but I wish him all the best. 

I’m feeling really proud of myself for not letting him back in. When the break up first happened, I was desperate for him to come back. It wasn’t easy rejecting him, as there’s a part of me that will always miss those good times, but I’m putting myself first and won’t allow him to hurt me again.",y5ri24,330,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/y5ri24/my_da_ex_came_back_and_i_rejected_him/,AnxiousAttachment,1

27,"Why are some of us perfectly healthy and happy when single, but then lose ourselves in dating/relationships?","Just a question I've been pondering recently...

Several articles I've read on Attachment Theory state that APs are more likely to jump into relationships and have a hard time being single. As for me, I'm actually pretty happy being single, so long as I have a good group of friends and family around me. Of course I do want a relationship with the goal of getting married and starting a family, but it's not something that I have an inescapable compulsion toward when I am single.

However, when I get to know someone with romantic intent, out comes all of the limerence, neediness, and anxiety. The compulsion to draw closer is much stronger. If these behaviors represent my sub-conscious mind trying to fill an unmet need, why isn't it trying to fill that need as desperately when I'm single? Or are we somehow repressing that need when we're single?",nkldyj,298,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/nkldyj/why_are_some_of_us_perfectly_healthy_and_happy/,AnxiousAttachment,1

31,Dating my first secure person and….. WOW.,"My last ex of 4 years was definitely more on the avoidant side, but I didn’t realize it at the time because it was my first real relationship. Now I am dating someone secure and it’s insane to see how different I feel. 
Tonight, he was driving home (2 hour drive) and he offered to call but also said we could call when he got home. I said we could call, but then he never responded so immediately I assumed he just wanted space and didn’t ask him further and attempted to suppress my anxiety the entire time. The next 2 hours goes by and he calls me, surprised saying he didn’t see my text and asked why I didn’t just call him. I told him I figured he wanted space and he said “what? Why would I want space? I love you and always wanna talk to you and your calls are always welcomed.” 

I’m bawling. Such a simple thing can be so profound.",yfheoj,274,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/yfheoj/dating_my_first_secure_person_and_wow/,AnxiousAttachment,1

34,Sometimes it's not your attachment system; sometimes you're just dating the wrong person.,"I've always been secure in relationships. While I had some anxious tendencies, I was never affected by insecure attachment. When things went wrong, I would try to sort it out and then leave if nothing changed. If I realised someone was not good for me, I quickly left. Because of this, I never had many dating troubles and in some cases, I am on very friendly terms with men I used to date. One guy even told me that the girls he now dates aren't as upfront about their needs in the way I was and he misses that. That's how clear and effective I was in my communication.

Things changed when I started dating my current partner, who is DA. After the first few months where he seemed secure like myself, his avoidance started to show and that's when my anxiety kicked in. At first his deactivations were manageable for me. I had an active social life, my own hobbies and a job. So I didn't even *have* the time to be preoccupied by him anyways. When COVID hit, we ended up isolating together and even though I tried to keep a safe distance and focus on myself, the constant presence made it very hard to live with him. Soon my anxiety kicked in full force and I started being triggered every other day. Every secure practice and effective communication strategy that worked for me in the past barely made a dent. I tried to respect his wishes, respect his privacy and space and was as clear as I could be about my own needed. Nothing worked. However, **leaving him became incredibly difficult**. At this point we had been together for a year and I had grown so attached, that the idea of walking away hurt me a lot. I never used to have problems walking away from people who weren't good for me. But with him, my self-esteem was so low that I felt as if leaving would leave me worse off because who would want me? Yes, thats how bad I felt. I felt as if no one would want me because his deactivation got to the point where I felt as if he didnt want me. This also meant that I spent every other day with an activated attachment system.

For those who are lurking and don't know what that is, an activated attachment system is one of the most mentally and physically taxing experiences one can go through. Those of you who have or continue to experience them know exactly what I mean. The increased heart rate, the restlessness and inability to sit still, the distress in the chest, the ruminating thoughts and the general paralysis which arrests all ability to reason or complete any task successfully. It can feel as if the world is ending and all negative thoughts become so real, it become hard to distinguish between the anxious mind and real life. The protest behaviours which follow are also not ones to be proud of. *I went from being very secure to very anxious within the space of two years*.

I've finally decided to walk away. And guess what; the very thought of leaving him makes me feel relieved. It doesn't hurt me as much anymore. It doesn't cause me the same pain or distress anymore. I'm currently working on my exit strategy (I need my support system around as much as possible as I know actually breaking up with him might be more painful in reality). And I'm also starting a new job soon so I want to sort out logistics first before I finally do it.

My point is: sometimes we act the way we do because our attachment system is at play. And we should take 10000% responsibility for our actions. But be open to the fact that sometimes it's not you with the problem, but maybe you're dating someone who triggers you. Sometimes you're just in the wrong situation that brings out the worse in you. And that's also okay to admit. But be sure to take responsibility for that too.",oe1sk0,266,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/oe1sk0/sometimes_its_not_your_attachment_system/,AnxiousAttachment,1

39,Sometimes you are anxious because the relationship you are in is actually unhealthy.,"I’ve been lurking in this subreddit for awhile now, and have made some posts and interacted with a few people here. I personally identify with having an anxious attachment style, but I believe I have one because I feel anxious even when there is no clear reason to be, and I act out to cope with this feeling in ways that damage the relationships I’m in. 

Many of the posts I see here describe unhealthy relationship dynamics. Of course you’d feel anxious in a relationship that makes you feel unsafe. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have an anxious attachment style, and that you need to “fix” yourself, but that you’re unhappy in your relationship because your reasonable needs are not getting met. I’ve learnt from experience. You’ll never be able to self soothe yourself enough if you’re in an unhealthy relationship. 

So many people here are trying to make relationships work with avoidant people. I fear that downright abusive people are being seen as just “avoidant”. You do not need to be patient and extend compassion to someone who hurts you and does not seek to heal themselves. I’d never be with any avoidant who wasn’t self aware and actively working on it. You all put a lot of work into overcoming your own traumas, the people you are with should be doing the same. That’s not too much to ask. 

I’d also personally never let a new partner know that I’m more predisposed to feeling anxious. I’ve seen this used often as a way to gaslight people. Instead of telling you you’re crazy, they’ll tell you that you are anxious, even when it’s an appropriate response. “I don’t mistreat you, that’s just your anxiety speaking”. So many of you are telling yourselves that your unhealthy relationships will be healthy once you fix yourself. But that’s not what healthy relationships are about. They are about unconditional love and acceptance. About growing together as people. About someone loving you and being open to who you are, right now. You should never feel as if you need to fix yourself to be loved. The relationships you maintain with people do form your sense of identity. Before you attempt to fix yourself.. make sure the people around you aren’t creating the problems in the first place.",zpw1zt,257,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/zpw1zt/sometimes_you_are_anxious_because_the/,AnxiousAttachment,1
40,Just got into a secure relationship and I will NEVER be with an Avoidant again,"I am so proud of myself. I finally got into a relationship with a secure partner! The biggest difference between a DA and secure is the attraction you feel between them. 

Initially I only felt some attraction towards the secure but what I found is over time the course of months I became more attracted to them.

I feel like I can fully trust my partner as we are able to sit down and discuss problems without resorting to shutdowns and projections. 

When I have a need, they listen and do what they can to their best ability, making me a PRIORITY. 

They text me just as much as I text them.

I don't feel anxiety over them. 

I am also becoming more secure with them.

Whenever I experience avoidant behaviour, instead of blaming myself and being attracted to it, I am actually repulsed by it. Like if you are gonna ignore me for 5 days because you 'feel' like it, then I'll just ignore you for life because I feel like it too.",v61yu0,255,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/v61yu0/just_got_into_a_secure_relationship_and_i_will/,AnxiousAttachment,1
41,My top 3 tips to really begin to heal your insecure attachment.,"I am FA typically leaning heavily anxious but beginning to lean secure. The level of confidence I have in navigating this world and relationships is well worth all of the struggle to achieve a more secure based attachment. I just got married to my avoidant partner who is also beginning to lean secure as well. We almost got stuck in the anxious avoidant trap and I almost ended it as I begun to work at healing my attachment. However, we've done a 180 and continue to make progress, by both taking to time to understand ourselves and each other through therapy. As well as practicing tips we've learned. So here's my top 3 tips that would help anxious attachment and anxiety in general.

**1) Practice doing the exact opposite of what you'd typically do when you're triggered.** Alot of our behavior is due to past experiences and fears of being hurt, abandoned etc. So if you're used to doing things like, double texting when you don't hear back from a partner or friend, stop doing so. Even if you have to type it out, do not send. Read it back to yourself and ask yourself if this is anxious behavior and if it's conducive to actually making you feel better. Along the same idea, I'd wait to mention or bring up anything until you've thoroughly worked through being triggered. If then you realize there's something that you can request from your partner or friend, only then do so.

**2) Up the amount of time you spend alone and or with friends or family outside of a romantic relationship.** Set new goals for yourself at work, in fitness, in eating better etc. Basically take care of you better than you have before. Start taking yourself out on a date at least once a month. Go have your favorite meal, go see that movie you've been wanting to see or simply spend some hours by the pool reading without your phone (unless you have kids or someone you caretake for). 

**3) Accept your current limitations and set boundaries around that.** You're trying to become secure, so you're not going to be able to keep trying to have close relationships and frequent interactions with people who trigger you the most. Or be in certain scenarios that cause you anxiety. Especially not while you're beginning your journey. You will just default to learned behaviors. You're not currently able to be a safe space for others or not be affected by certain things. You will have to break up with a partner or end a friendship with someone who is insecurely attached and doesn't want to change. I took a break from interacting much with my mom most of last year. We've had a strained relationship and I had a hard time setting boundaries with her. I no longer immediately change my plans for anyone or response right away if I'm truly busy. With my partner, I told him I'd need him to join therapy with me to learn how to work through conflict and improve communication. The relationship would have ended if he would have stayed unwilling to do any work in those areas with me.

I hope these things help those looking for where to start and changes to make that will move you closer to secure. I've been on this journey for 2 years now and I no longer feel weighed down by anxiety. I actually find joy in the little things now. I hope the same for you guys! <3",13qz2jm,258,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/13qz2jm/my_top_3_tips_to_really_begin_to_heal_your/,AnxiousAttachment,1

44,A proud moment 🥲,"A guy that I was dating started to be really inconsistent with texting and after he hadn’t replied for a week I sent him a “…?” 

He replied the next day saying that he had a lot going on at the moment and he hasn’t meant to be shitty at texting but he’s been genuinely very busy. He said that he doesn’t think he has time to balance dating with everything he has going on at the moment but it was nice to get to know me. 

I was disappointed but ultimately I want someone who will take the time to prioritize our relationship so I just hit him with “Okie thanks for letting me know. That sounds overwhelming. I trust you’ll figure everything out ☺️” 

No begging, no protesting, no trying to change his mind, no trying to push my need for prioritization down to try to accommodate him, no snarky comment about how he doesn’t seem too busy to watch all my instagram stories within an hour of me posting them (ok maybe I am still a bit anxiously checking if he’s watching them 😂 hey we can’t be 100% perfect).

47,"If your SO is generally kind and loving, not being abusive, and just going about life doing their thing, and you notice your anxiety being triggered…","…from their texting and/ or communication habits, or when they spend (a reasonable amount of) time away from you, this is a GOOD thing!

It’s a blessing to find ourselves in a safe place, such as in a relationship with a good kind person, and still get triggered. Because it shows us what we need to work on within ourselves.

What an opportunity! First thing to do is thank your SO.

“When you didn’t text me back for 4 hours, it triggered some stuff for me, and I’ve journaled about it, and it’s now on my list of my issues I’m exploring. Thank you so much for all that you do, especially being here with me now and letting me share this with you, and being so supportive for me as I navigate my healing journey. I’m so grateful!”

Then thank yourself for how reasonable and reflective you’re being about it. Feel the gratitude in your body for both yourself and your SO. For everything in your life that allows you to feel even a few moments of calm safety to reflect on your gratitude for your triggers.

Then get to working on the stuff behind those triggers. Your SO is not responsible for any of it. Not even if they wanted to be. It has nothing to do with them, aside from they happened to be in the right place and innocently did exactly what you needed to activate your trigger.

Start by giving yourself generous attention needed to make progress. Listen to your body. What is it telling you about emotional pain and issues you are holding that need healing? Don’t miss out on this amazing opportunity you have!

When we are otherwise physically and emotionally safe in the NOW, this is the best time to tune into unresolved issues and start a path to healing and resolution. 

Triggers are our friend during this time because how are we going to discover hidden issues if they are not being triggered?",12xoo72,235,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/12xoo72/if_your_so_is_generally_kind_and_loving_not_being/,AnxiousAttachment,1

50,The dark reality of being A Dismissive Avoidant,"Avoidants have a terrible reputation--particularly dismissive avoidants. Due to the lack of expressed emotions they are regularly regarded as awful people. They are routinely misdiagnosed with NPD, ASPD and psychopathy by their partners. From the outside they crave love but reject it when you offer it, it can seem  puzzling and downright insane, so let me explain their subconscious thought processes.

Avoidants tend to have a very long history of short relationships but it's not done intentionally. Much like every other attachment, avoidants long for connection but their core wounds prohibit them from forming and maintaining those connections.

One of the core beliefs of the avoidants is that they are fundamentally unlovable--or at the very least, defective. They subconsciously believe that love is a deeply hurtful and painful experience--but they still crave it like everyone else.

Since they believe they are unlovable, they want to make sure that whoever is going to stick around is going to truly love them despite how defective they believe themselves to be. They will do this by pushing their partner away through neglect, projection, self sabotage and criticism.

the hallmark of a good attachment figure to the avoidant is someone who stands by despite the dysfunctional circumstance, because this is what their (likely dismissive) caregivers expected from them as a child.

The pushing-away never ends even if the resolve of the partner has been proven to be strong. It started as a test to see their resolve but it eventually turns into the subconscious wanting to repeat the pattern of abandonment--to align with their beliefs of being unlovable.

Months and months of this behaviour usually causes their partner to become incredibly insecure, they may give up and walk away or criticize the avoidant's behaviours. The avoidant's core wound of being unlovable kicks in and their beliefs of abandonment are reinforced yet again.

Even when the partner has shown an insurmountable amount of patience to the avoidant, this is met with suspicion and escalating push-backs will be thrown out until they crack. If things are ""too good"", then they may just up-and-leave out of the blue.

They appear to move on almost immediately after a breakup but it's usually because the breakup hasn't registered emotionally at all.

The Processing of emotions and events is avoided since it triggers painful feelings. Avoidants take so long to process emotions because they deny themselves from it with constant distractions and deactivation strategies. 6 months for an AP--who generally feel everything from the start; is usually enough time to have processed most if not, all feelings. 6 months for a DA and that's when they usually begin to really feel things, typically manifested in a deep depression.

Avoidants may not even correlate their depression with the demise of the relationship, the gap between the breakup and hurt is often so large that it doesn't seem like cause-and-effect. They aren't the type to seek help and they are likely to rationalize it as a depressive-episode rather than the symptom of repressed emotions.

The only time they may truly appreciate relationships is when it is beyond reconcile, when their core wounds aren't triggered by it anymore.

They aren't too different from the anxious, they have the same story of being saved by ""the one""; someone who will be so great and loving that their core wounds will be healed by them. But this is just fantasy, much like the AP, they become the villain of their own story by sabotaging themselves. No matter how much someone may love them, if they can't heal their wounds then they will push them away eventually.

This is can incredibly dark reality to live and I hope you will learn to empathize with the avoidant, even though they may have been cold--if not cruel to you.",vgwi9h,235,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vgwi9h/the_dark_reality_of_being_a_dismissive_avoidant/,AnxiousAttachment,1

56,It’s not your job to fix them. It’s codependent and you’re abandoning yourself.,"I have to tell myself this every. damn. day.

You can be successful, good looking, take care of your body, socially active, and generally put together and healthy.

But you still struggle to find a good partner? Why?

It’s because instead of choosing people who are healthy, available, come from a history of good relationship (both their family, and their own personal ones), and have generally worked through their childhood issues, baggage, and traumas - we choose people who are unaware and broken inside and think we can fix them.

It’s actually unhealthy. It’s codependent. And then we end up heartbroken because the inevitable happens - they leave. Why? Because they always were. And it’s time to start looking in the mirror and asking yourself why are YOU choosing these partners? Why are YOU choosing to stay after you know who they are? Why do you let them back thinking it’ll be different if they haven’t started therapy or their education?

Because YOU love the high. YOU love the chase of getting back to that “moment” of intensity you once had.

If only I could apply the same standards I have for my job, body, and spiritually to relationships lol.

I guess that little kid in me still needs some more love. Cheers to soul searching in 2023 and only picking partners who have done the work.

I don’t know why but today I just have some healthy anger. Feeling inspired and more hopeful after a rough breakup to work on myself and start demanding better.

EDIT: I’d also like to say, please do not slander or attack avoidants. It’s easy to turn blame outwards because it allows us not to face the reality that we are self abandoning in a lot of these situations we end up hurt in. Avoidants are good people too and are lost, just like a lot of us.",132wffg,220,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/132wffg/its_not_your_job_to_fix_them_its_codependent_and/,AnxiousAttachment,1
57,Walking away because he can't meet my needs.,"It happened. 😔 3 months in & his true colours have started to show. 

As much as I care about him, he's not able to meet my needs. 

I moved very strategically through this relationship. I was calm & collected, voiced MY needs (which were very reasonable), listened to his & adjusted my ways... 

But he just can't seem to do the same for me. And I can't be with someone who's unable to meet my basic needs as an anxious individual. 

I FEAR the conversation of ending it this weekend & I fear how I'm going to feel. 

But I KNOW I got me. I'm gonna survive this. I'm gonna pick up the pieces of my broken heart, heal, & move on. 💔


UPDATE! ⚠️
I ended it. I told him that I have been feeling disconnected and that my needs are continuously not being met. I put 100% in from the start and I dont feel it has been reciprocated. I told him I don't think this feeling is gonna go away for me. I thanked him for letting me get to know him a little and wished him all the best.",ywfyly,216,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ywfyly/walking_away_because_he_cant_meet_my_needs/,AnxiousAttachment,1
58,"""If your gut says something is off, it is"" isn't always the best advice when you're dealing with anxious attachment","I get a bit frustrated when I see this advice dished out all over this sub. I mean, it sometimes applies, if you're feeling a DA pull away. But anxious attachment often TELLS the gut something is wrong when it often isn't, and that's the core problem when it comes to attachment issues, because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. In my experience, FA/AP healing means not reacting to the gut, because it's often a survival reaction that isn't tied to the true present.

My gut often tells me something is wrong when my partner takes a while to text me back in the middle of the work day. Aaaand my gut is wrong, because my gut is trying to protect me from abandonment I experienced in childhood. In reality, my partner was on a long business call, and he's often thrilled to be off the call so he can talk to me.

Idk, I'll probably regret posting this because it might be too opinionated and perhaps anecdotal, and I'll probably get some angry comments tied to specific instances when trusting your gut is right. But in my experience, part of my healing is *not* trusting my gut, letting myself calm down, and seeing why my gut is reacting the way it is. 99% of the time, it's because of unhealed trauma and not tied to reality.",11zmw8l,214,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11zmw8l/if_your_gut_says_something_is_off_it_is_isnt/,AnxiousAttachment,1
59,I think I have to leave this sub,"So much of this sub is really lovely, supportive people working toward secure attachment. But a weirdly large amount are anxious attachers who only post looking for validation for their behavior without any accountability, not-so-subtle shit-talking of DAs (can’t count the number of times I’ve seen “DA” and “narcissist” used synonymously), and grossly controlling and manipulative behavior excused and even celebrated. 

I honestly think this sub is starting to subconsciously move me backward in terms of my own secure attachment. If you’re engaging in unhealthy anxious behavior and using this sub to justify not making progress or vilifying the DAs in your life instead of working on yourself - you’ve created an echo chamber and it’s keeping you stuck.

I genuinely hope everyone here finds what they’re looking for, but I can’t be the only AP-leaning secure who has been driven away.

63,Don’t put up with bad behaviour in the name of attachment theory. You deserve to have your needs met in a relationship,"Attachment theory is not a reason to put up with bad behaviour in relationships. I have been a silent lurker on this subreddit for a while now and I keep seeing stories from people trying to make relationships work with people who are exhibiting avoidant behaviours. The beginning of a relationship is usually when the person is on their best behaviour. If they’re being avoidant at this stage, it will not get better. It doesn’t really matter why someone is unable to meet your needs in the early stages, because the outcome is the same - your needs are not being met. It’s also important to be careful about labelling people as avoidant when they’re just not into you. 

If you really want to be happy, you cannot lean into your triggers. If a person is triggering your anxious attachment style, that is usually a red flag. At this point, the only option is to walk away. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller advise against getting into relationships with avoidants because they rarely end well for the person who is anxiously attached. It’s possible to develop a secure attachment style but that involves being able to walk away from people who make you feel anxious in the beginning. I used to think I was anxiously attached until I started dating someone who was secure last year. I have never felt safer in a relationship and he has never triggered my anxiety. You deserve to have your needs met. Don’t settle for less.",su21xc,206,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/su21xc/dont_put_up_with_bad_behaviour_in_the_name_of/,AnxiousAttachment,1

71,A message of hope and strength for my Anxious Attachers,"Hello, my gorgeous Anxious Attachers. 

Ultimately, i am writing this for the me, 1 year ago, that needed to read this so bad.

I also write this for every single person who thinks they have been with someone who identifies as ""avoidant"" when it comes to attachment theory: who is currently in pain, heartache, wondering wtf just happened, if they are worthless, if they pushed them away, if they will ever come back, if that one, specific, tiny thing they did ended their relationship and, at the end of the day, if they will ever have that romantic relationship that they've always wanted (the one that lives in your heads with the music and sunlight). 

First things first. Attachement theory is not everything, it is very nuanced. We anxious attachers need to sort ourselves out. Nobody is going to want to be with someone who cannot function independently and emotionally when in a relationship. Own your shit. There is so much power there. I know that being with someone romantically gives you a chance to right all the wrongs that happened years ago. But stop that, right now. Go to therapy, realise your triggers, become self aware, be REALLY kind to yourself and for God's sake, have some internal dialogue before you attach stories to events that keep you awake at night. Also, try to attach less quick. I know they are pretty but that doesn't mean your wedding dress goes well with their complexion. 
99% of they time, the stories ypu tell yourself aren't true! And you know that! Your brain will none the less create the worst case scenario to try to protect you from danger. Understand that. Work with it. Read and listen to Eckhart Tolle, Craig Kenneth, Jilllian on Love, Esther Perel, Jeff Guenther, Thais Gibson etc. Seek out your teachers! I've given you a few good ones to start with! Master your damn self, instead of feeling all kinds of shame cos you called someone 27 times in 1 hour. 

Secondly. 
That avoidant person who kept you constantly wondering if you were too much/ little/not enough, who made you think you were asking for too much, who blindsided you at the most unexpected moment and acted cold and heartless during and after. Who were always, ""busy"" despite you knowing you should be a priority. Who rejected all your compliments and efforts and found pleasure in criticising you. Who made you feel ""other"" because you wanted closeness and they wanted something less close... Who continued their life as though you two never happened and thought they were faultless at the end of it all. Whilst you cried those deep, diaphragm tears that shake your entire body as you wonder ""is it because I like oregano?!""  And you search endlessly for ""get your boyfriend/girlfriend back videos"".  For that ""one answer"" as to why they did what they did.
 
NO! Stop that shit now. PLEASE. 
You are enough exactly, EXACTLY as you are. Right now, in this moment, as you read this - you are enough. 
Breathe. Exhale. 
You are enough. 
...and fuck them.  

They were a lesson. They aren't bad people (truly) and they have their own shit to sort out (apparently they rarely do). If you are going to look at break up videos, Craig Kenneth is the ONLY channel you need. Stop searching how to fix this. Cry. Sob. Ache. Feel the pain and go through. They were not the one. There is no ""one"", so get over that too! 

People only treat other people, HOW THEY TREAT THEMSELVES. 
I'm not saying anxious attachers are faultless, every story is different but ultimately, if you feel like you got completely screwed over and you were a good partner. If you were accountable, honest, kind, reflective, non judgemental, open etc that is NOTHING to do with you and EVERYTHING to do with them. No one on this earth is perfect. Our perfection COMES FROM our imperfections. 

Please, please, please take comfort in knowing that your days of wondering wtf you mean to this person are done. They have disqualified themselves from your life and care. You must emotionally remove them when you are ready. When you are, I recommend you write a final letter and then burn it outside with some gorgeous, epic music and wine- but each to their own! 

For the last 365 days I have studied relational theory and all its forms to understand what the hell I just endured. I've been on all the reddit, channels, Quoras, etc etc. Ive done the work for you! As well as doing an actual course in this stuff. I cried tears deeper than when family members died. Ultimately, i doubted my worth as an actualy bloody human. You know what I found? One great truth. If they dont work on themselves, deeply, honestly, (and its a really big hill to climb for them) they will NEVER have a fulfilling relationship. Take that as your wings and fly! Take that as your justice after all this! That doesn't mean you were faultless! That applies to you too. Look at yourself, do better for yourself. But what we all know is that our access to love, reciprocation, compassion, romance, sweet moments etc is so much easier for us than it is them. We over give, they don't give enough - if at all. We have a head start. But do the WORK.

And I can also offer you some light from the other side. I'm a Brit, I met an American man 8 years ago. He found out I was single 6 months ago, booked a flight to see me and from that day we have been together. He gives me more affection, compassion, kindness, love, sensuality, aliveness, interest, desire, want etc in 24hours than I ever got in 1.5 years with my dismissive avoidant ex. It is literally night and day. Ali laugh at my last relarionship. And we are 2000 miles apart, yet making it work. 
Most of all? It is safe and calm. I do not doubt for one second how he feels about me and therefore? I have 0 anxiety. 

I, no longer wonder why my parter faces away from me when they sleep or why they dismiss my kindness. I am not worried that if I tell my partner how much they mean to me that I'll get some half arsed response and they will disappear for a week. I can be totally, 100% all that I am - warts and all - and I am treasured, honoured for my faults. 

Someone is out there, waiting for you - for YOU. They are just around the corner and they have dreamt of you for SUCH a long time. Do them a favour, work on your stuff now so that you are so ready for them when they arrive. 

The avoidant has made you feel a pain you've never felt before. Let this be a lesson that you only need teaching once. Never accept less than what you know you deserve.
Avoidants are just like us, only opposite. We must give them our compassion but most importantly, we must be far, far more selective to who we give our love and hearts away to. 

We don't need to be perfect to have the love we've always dreamt of. We just need to be self aware, open and have a desire to grow. 

The right partner will love you for your journey, not some abstract destination. 

I love every single one of you and I promise, they are waiting for you xxx",12asrxq,190,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/12asrxq/a_message_of_hope_and_strength_for_my_anxious/,AnxiousAttachment,1

73,Alternative to “playing it cool”,"I just watched a video on YouTube by a popular dating coach that I will not link because the title and thumbnail is kinda triggering for those of us who are hard on ourselves. 

But one thing he said that REALLY helped me forgive myself for all the times I gushed my feelings for people who never deserved me was basically:

For those of us who purposely reserve or withhold our feelings to “play it cool”, it’s better to show your interest authentically, knowing that interest (just like all other feelings you have) comes and goes. See your flirtation or affection like a photograph that captures a specific moment in time. Just because you’re interested in someone today doesn’t mean you will be tomorrow. And especially if someone isn’t reciprocating, you can always redirect that interest and energy toward someone/something else Basically you have the right to change your mind about someone, so being vulnerable with them in one specific moment doesn’t give away any of your power. Your true power doesn’t lie in who’s more interested in who at any given moment. It lies in your ability to redirect that attention when you aren’t being met halfway. 

You have nothing to lose by being your true self around someone because your feelings and interest can change. 



I would love for us anxious types to embrace and be proud of our ability to attach and love so easily. That’s a rare thing for people to find and if they’re unlucky enough to pass up on that kind of adoration when the iron is hot, they’ll miss out. Don’t beat yourself up for double/triple texting someone who ended up ghosting you, or for showing your interest and being rejected. You still have that love inside you, you didn’t give it away you just showed it off. Today you can redirect your attention to other things whenever you want. That’s your power and no one can take that away from you.",13fju50,187,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/13fju50/alternative_to_playing_it_cool/,AnxiousAttachment,1

76,"You get your answer, you move on. No reply is also an answer. You deserve more. Stop thinking it's anymore","Texting is shit. I am nervous on the phone. But I do try my best. Texting games - 3 to 5 day rule, investment levels etc. I never thought dating as so much complicated. I know I suffer from anxiety. I stop all notifications from messaging coming through so I wouldn't keep waiting on his messages. I keep deleting WhatsApp, hoping he ll miss me or something.

 It's in my head. I want to cling onto something comfortable. I want to stop dating, stay with one. I want to stop conversations of *hi how are you, what are you looking for on here?"". I know he is not the right one, I cling on because I want a relationship, someone to hug and snuggle with, the idea of it.... Even if it's the shittiest of guys.

When they tell you, they don't see it developing further. Have standards and walk. Don't tell them, ""oh casual is good for me too"". Just walk. Cause you stay on, thinking this set up is good. You just screw yourself over with more mind games. 

When they tell you, they like you, they still want to see you, and they don't put in the effort to see you. You got your answer. Even the busiest of people can reply on a toilet bowl, he can surely do that too. If you are one who likes to have the last word, give him 3-5 days, occupy yourself, keep yourself busy... Give him a closing statement, good bye and farewell, thanks for everything. 

Move on, stop contacting him. 

I have given my guy an ultimatum. ""These are my days, if you are interested. I am not going to linger around until you pick a day, I am just going to assume you are not interested... Till then, you can stay in the.pen pal zone."". He did not reply. That's an answer. He is too gutless to do it. He is not keen.

Move on, stop thinking about him. You cannot change a guy's mind about commitments and all that. You can't make him fall in love with you.

Yes, it's comforting with the euphoria of short bursts of love. It's not enough to go the long run. 

When you are the one driving a relationship, he is just there for the ride, how is it different sleeping with a gigalo or taking a gigalo for hiking for the day? 

You know what you need to do. Do it, your future self will thank you, not to waste time with a low investment. 
It hurts. I know. That feeling of a fork scraping on your heart, stabbing your throat, the coldness on your shoulders. ... 

Tell yourself, you are worth it, he can't see your worth, it's fine. Move on. You don't need to stay to make him see it. I don't need to prove to anyone. I don't need to prove to my ex that I am desired, I don't need to prove to my friends that I got everything going.

83,How anxious preoccupied persons self sabotage relationships - from a secure partners perspective,"Hi all,

6 months ago I (M24) and my ex (F23) of 6 years broke up. Due to neglect from her mother and some bullying problems during her upbringing she has develop a severe case of AP attachment. I myself never experienced anything like this which, god bless, has given me a secure base to stand on and hence a secure attachment. However, like any human I also have my flaws and some avoidant tendencies (I believe no one can have a 100% secure attachment). Many of these tendencies are actually a result of how my ex GF acted in our relationship. Let me explain further.

After months of studying attachment theory and a lot of self reflection of my and my ex's behavior in our relationship I have reached a point where I can look back at my ex's problems with much more clarity. In my experience the vast majority of posts on this subreddit is written by the partner with the anxious attachment. Therefore I want to give the opportunity to share some core unhealthy behaviors that my ex GF did in our relationship due to her anxiety and how it affected me, all from the perspective of a securely attached partner.

Of course every insecurity is in a spectrum and you might not find some (or all) of these behaviors in yourself but from reading about anxious attachment I have come to understand that these behaviors are not uncommon. The behaviors will be given in the points below and the paragraph following each point is my experience of the behavior and how I feel like it affected me.

&#x200B;

* Losing your own individual life to be able to better hide yourself in the relationship. Such as losing friends and hobbies to be able to give more (or even all) of your energy to your partner and the relationship. When you are not with your partner you no longer plan to hangout with friends on your own or do things that you previously enjoyed.

This made me feel like my ex's happiness and entertainment was my responsibility which added a lot of pressure on me and made me feel more suffocated. Every time I went out with my friends/did things on my own I almost always felt so guilty because I knew my GF just stayed home bored and did never do anything on her own (like meeting her own friends). Sometimes I myself even stayed home instead of meeting up friends just from the guilt. It also made me resent her when she often (in the beginning of our relationship) almost always wanted to go with me even if I was just to meet my guy friends. I personally think this is the most damaging behavior and as you will notice this is laying the foundation of some of the other problems that I will state below. It is so important to keep and maintain your own individual life outside the relationship. This also made my ex have unrealistic behavior in communication and time I should give her. Since she did not have much other things to put her time on she expected me to do the same and give the same amount of time/energy to her when I had both university and a part time job to look after.

&#x200B;

* Taking every hint of disconnection or rejection personally and always expecting the worst of every outcome. Such as starting to lose emotional control whenever your partner starts to act more distant than usual, especially when you know logically that it is because of things unrelated to you (such as stress at work). Whenever your partner tells you any critics you interpret the worst case scenario of that statement. For example; your partner tells you that they do not like the way you *sometimes* talk to their mother and you interpret this as they don't like the way you *always* talk to their mother.

This was a huge problem for me. Whenever I became more distant, for reasons such as studying to an exam or being stressed at work, my ex always took this personally and thought that it was because of her this change in my behavior happened. In reality 95% of the times this happened it was because of reasons that had absolutely nothing to do with her but she got triggered and started to suffocate me (required more attention and affection) which is the last thing you want in a situation like this. This made me more distant which triggered an unhealthy circle for us both. My distance seeking behavior was not because of her but she eventually made it that way. By always expecting the worst of each statement or critic I gave her I always felt that I was walking on eggshells and that I could not be completely honest which made me resent her and none of our problems could no longer improve.

&#x200B;

* Hiding your emotions and needs due to fear of making your partner lose interest and then blow up when your partner do not understand you cues or hints. Rarely or even never communicate your needs or problems in a direct fashion. Instead of telling your partner exactly what you need you instead leaves hints that you expect your partner to understand.

The problem I experience with this was that my ex felt like she was straight forward with when she tried to hint what she needed and then expected me to understand her. Instead of being honest and saying ""I feel like we haven't emotionally connected for a while, can we try to spend some time together somewhere in the following days"" she instead, almost demandingly, say ""can we go on a walk tonight"" and when I responded with that I do not feel like that she got very upset. In hindsight she clearly wanted me to spend more time with her but instead of telling me that she instead began demanding my time. This made me resent her, epically when I had much else going on in my life, which so often (not surprisingly) aligned with this kind of behavior from her.

&#x200B;

* Trying to get affection from your partner by doing protest behaviors such as trying to make them jealous and guilt them. Telling your partner that someone hit on you with the purpose of getting a reaction from them. Brining up things they did to hurt you a long time ago to try to guilt them in doing something you want.

So often when me and my ex met some guy she knows she would tell me later how he used to chase her or hit on her. She could even go into details and go into what he had exactly told her and also state that this happened after we started dating. She did this to get a reaction from me to reassure her that I stilled wanted her. However, instead of getting a reaction from me, she would instead just lower my self confidence because she made me compare myself with the guy I just met. She would also sometimes bring up old stuff that I had made to hurt her when she wanted me to stay home instead of going out or while we were arguing. This made me feel very bad about myself but at the same time resent her.

My intention by writing this is not to bash people with AP attachment. You guys are the most loving and caring persons out there. If you do not let your anxiety or insecurity get the best of you you will be the best kind of partner. Remember you all deserve love and are so lovable!!

Hope this post can give you some insight of my perspective and hopefully makes you realize what behavior you should avoid in your current or future relationships.

Best of luck to all! <3 <3

84,Dating a non-avoidant person is so refreshing and empowering,"**I tried to weed out avoidants in OLD**

It's like the number one rule that if you're anxious you shouldn't date an avoidant. And if you do - you'll be miserable, because well, what did you expect?

I know and I think you know too. It's not like I *want* to date people who aren't available and can't commit. I have introverted hobbies and I work remotely, I'm living in a foreign country in a rural area - I don't exactly meet new people *in person*.

Online dating. Yes, the hated online dating. There's so many of them. It's the best paradise for an avoidant person, so they can go seeking fake connection and intimacy, they can pretend to be somebody else, they can have a sense of an emotional connection without any commitment and they can bail anytime. So they install it, and:

* Some will open the app, start swiping and get scared once they imagine some form of commitment and will close the app immediately
* Some will get scared once they match with you and you write them a message and they decide to never reply
* Some will get scared once you ask to meet them in person
* Some will get scared once you ask to be exclusive, or to at least define what the hell you are
* *you know the drill*

And it's. so. hard. to filter through that. There's so many as they keep coming back (or let's be honest, never leaving), because they can't commit in a real relationship. Some will be so charming and present in the beginning before they start feeling suffocated. Before they start deactivating and pulling away. It's so hard to tell. 

**I overcommunicated to scare them**

Yep. Long messages. Commitment. Care. Questions. More questions. Expressing I get anxious. Telling the other person I. need. clear. communication. Arranging a date. If they're not 100% in, they're OUT. If they were lukewarm about meeting? Out. Can't set a clear day and time? Out. Make me wait 2 days to plan a date? Out. I'm awesome and if they care to get to know me, they'll know that. If they can't see it, bye.

Sure I did scare some people away, and I'm glad I did! In the end there was a charming person who replied to my long messages with even longer messages. They apologized when they couldn't reply for hours, instead of guilt tripping me. And so did I. And it was so wholesome.

**I think a person I met is anxious leaning secure and so am I**

We both made extensive plans before meeting up (we had to travel quite a bit). We both communicated exactly where we are every few minutes. I felt them so present and so caring about everything going well - and I tried to be too.

We kept texting after the date. They sent me a good night text. They sent me a good morning text, just as I was typing a good morning text for them.

I don't want to be afraid to send those anymore, being scared that if I show too much affection, I'll push the other person away. I want to be affectionate and I want somebody who is affectionate towards me, as well.

Sometimes they send a message, then they worry it might be perceived wrong so they send another message with an over explanation. Sometimes I do, as well. And it's so cute. I know how to soothe them - and they know how to soothe me. They listen to me and they support me. They're *there* and it feels so comforting. If they can't reply, they let me know. After all this time, I finally feel safe with another person.

I know this might lead nowhere, but I'd be lying if I said it doesn't feel empowering. To actually have your effort met with effort, to not have your needs invalidated constantly and to not be guilt tripped for having the need to be connected. A connection can be a beautiful thing if it's with the right person.  I'm tired of being guilt tripped for that. I'm not scared of opening myself up anymore, because I know that I *will* find a person who will want to spend time with me and who will love me. I know it feels impossible given how much we deal with avoidants, but there are other people out there. There have to be.",tx1cgu,177,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/tx1cgu/dating_a_nonavoidant_person_is_so_refreshing_and/,AnxiousAttachment,1

86,Tip: A partner who's extremely quick to commit and hyper-romantic in the beginning can actually be a red flag of avoidance--especially if this behavior changes or stops suddenly.,"Some people will call this love-bombing, but I am not a mental health professional, so I'm not going to use that phrase directly. However, this behavior can very much resemble love-bombing (I don't believe avoidants usually do it purposefully, though, the way abusers might).

I pointed this out in a comment, but I thought this might be important to share. I wish I knew it two years ago. 

Avoidants want love and romance and connection just like we do. And when a relationship is still new, there's no commitment yet. Which means they can safely go all out and be as sexual and romantic as they want, and it doesn't have to mean anything (to them).

Another factor is that ""the chase"" is exhilarating for some people. Usually these folks have low self-esteem and get almost high on the rush of a new relationship. It's exciting when someone is interested in you, and it temporarily boots your confidence. But once they have you ""hooked,"" they start taking you for granted more and more, and the excitement dies down (because you love them now and aren't going anywhere, so they no longer need to work for your affection). Then, once you leave the honeymoon phase, they start seeing your flaws and, thus, will begin devaluing you more and more.

I was shocked when I learned this about my partner. He was literally telling me he loved me, wanted to be with me forever, and wanted me to move in by month two. You'd think that sounds like commitment, right? But later on, he confessed that the relationship didn't even feel ""real"" to him until around six months in. It's hard to believe that someone could make such grand commitment gestures but not actually mean it. And even further, now that the relationship feels ""real"" to him is when he stops being romantic. He doesn't make plans with me for the future now any further than what we're having for dinner this week.

I actually thought my boyfriend was secure in the beginning--maybe even anxious, because *he* was the clingy one for the first ~2-3 months. At the time, I had no dating experience, so I thought this behavior was just how someone acted when they really liked you.

Nowadays, when I ask about back then (and he doesn't completely clam up), he'll say that he acted that way because he knew I had low self-esteem, and he wanted to make it obvious that he liked me. And I'm thinking, ""But that doesn't mean you can now *stop* making it consistently obvious that you like me. I still need romance from time to time!"" It's like his feelings for me were stronger in the beginning, when it should be the other way around.",vjwcc3,176,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vjwcc3/tip_a_partner_whos_extremely_quick_to_commit_and/,AnxiousAttachment,1
87,I need space VS I need to talk,"Why does the person who needs space always get their way? Why is it that Im the one in the wrong when I really need to talk to someone to calm down. 

EVERYONE keeps telling me ""just leave them alone. Give them space. Focus on yourself. Let them reach out when they're ready to. If they never get back to you then just Let go. Move on. "" why? How is that fair ? I need to know what they're thinking in order to feel better and move on with ease. That is what I need. But they need space and time to think and breathe. Both our needs are valid aren't they? 

I feel like the world literally tells people who have anxiety that our needs do not matter as much as people who do not feel anxious. That people who can stay calm and deal with things alone deserve more respect and cooperation than people who struggle with anxious attachment. 

""Just let it go and focus on yourself"" 
I. CANT. I can not do that unless I know what he's thinking and feeling. Point blank period. 

Can someone for the love of god please give me some actual real advice on how to fix myself please. I've been in therapy for three years and I've grown in a lot of ways but this is the one thing I can't fix about myself. I got into an argument with my therapist last session because I was in the middle of an anxiety attack bc I was waiting for my SP to reply on how he feels about me. And she kept trying to make me do exercises and focus on the present moment. And I physically and mentally couldn't. I was incapable.  all I wanted was her to tell me how to stop being this way. I'm about to just start drinking myself silly or taking sleeping pills back to back to stop this anxiety of waiting around. Bc texting him again would be harassment bc he already asked me to stop . 

 no one tells me anything helpful other than to ""let it go"" 

If your parent was in the hospital and you felt the weight of uncertainty on your back how would you feel if your friend/therapist/the internet said ""just let it go and move on. Detach from the outcome"" as if you're a robot who never loved them to begin with so you can just shrug ur shoulders and take the L at the drop of a hat. 

Why can't I be normal and just give someone space who needs it without wanting to rip out my insides?? 

For context it's been a slow slow trickle over the course of a couple months of him talking to me less and less. canceling our plans.  So the other day I asked how he felt about me on the phone and he reassured me super super well that he's extremely into me and is looking forward to next time we see each other. But nothing changed. So I wanted to check and ask again, this time I was in an irritated mood about it. But he detected my pointed tone and it overwhelmed him. So he asked me to stop texting him bc he needs time to think it over. 

I don't even think I was being that pointed. He's just so sensitive to that stuff. I like how sensitive he is so bc it's also a strength of his to connect emotionally to me. So no judgement. It just makes me feel like I'm walking on eggshells sometimes. 

Anyway if anyone can please logically explain how it's possible for a human to just ""let go"" of someone they love with no clear conclusion or answers I'd love to hear it!",15q0gh0,174,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/15q0gh0/i_need_space_vs_i_need_to_talk/,AnxiousAttachment,1
88,An observation if you feel like you've been dropped like a piece of garbage...,"I'm (35F) 2 months post-BU with avoidant partner (39M) and I've had a realization that seems so obvious in hindsight.   


I think AA's are good at building intimacy since we are comfortable with being vulnerable. You have to be vulnerable to build intimacy and attach to someone. I realize now I mistook ""connection"" and my own expressions of vulnerability (and his appreciation for it) for two-way attachment. In reality, he enjoyed my openness, knowing what I was thinking/feeling, my curiosity to understand him, my expressions of love, the ways that I reached for him, and he would respond positively...but that isn't the same as reciprocating. I could see him trying to reciprocate sometimes, but I didn't think of it as a big deal that he was struggling, since I thought we were so close.  


I think one reason an avoidant ex is able to seemingly move on so fast that it makes you feel like you're garbage they're throwing away, is perhaps because they never knew how to attach in the first place. Maybe what feels like two-way attachment to you, is actually your ability to attach to someone else. The heart-wrenching pain you feel at being dropped so fast is partly your success at attaching. I think we give ourselvess such a hard time about being clingy and needy etc (and that separation anxiety is definitely there too) but healthy attachments DO cause immense pain when they are broken. The other person's inability to feel that pain, and their coldness toward your experience of it, is NOT because you are unworthy, but because they were unable to be vulnerable enough in the relationship to attach in a way that relationships require partners to attach in order to really thrive. So they've protected themselves from the pain of it breaking.  


So along with being aware of the separation anxiety you're experiencing, also be proud of yourself that you are able to be vulnerable and build intimacy, and brave enough to risk the pain it causes when it breaks.",x9bfng,170,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/x9bfng/an_observation_if_you_feel_like_youve_been/,AnxiousAttachment,1
89,Differences between the avoidants I've dates and secure partner,"*Prefacing this with saying that people with avoidant attachment (DA, FA) are loveable and worthy of care and I care a lot for some of the people referred to here

Avoidant partners (an amalgamation of different ppl with a range of avoidant behaviours):

- Went full on at the start, whirlwind romance then pulled back once I said I love you or showed investment in the relationship 

- Didn't text back for days/very inconsistent texting

- Didn't have clear plans for when to see each other next/frequently cancelled last minute

- Responded to tension by withdrawing, ignoring my texts and then ignoring my voiced distress at this

- couldn't empathise during tension/respond to my emotions, resorted to hard logic

- complained of being told off, made to feel guilty or controlled if I voiced anything that I was finding difficult about their behaviour 

- could do physical/sexual intimacy but not express affection or feelings in words

- became detached/uninterested in what I was saying whilst talking

- started talking about feelings for an ex

- responsed to tension or conflict by going on dating apps/meeting up with someone who had feelings for them/hooking up with someone else

- cancelled a trip away, talked about me going to a wedding with them then dropped all mention of it

- changed plans for an evening in and, when I was very tired after an emotionally demanding day at work, decided to go out instead and then react badly to my feeling hurt 

- wouldn't wait for me after a long queue for a planned date activity and just went to it alone then shut down my upset at this! (After being triggered by intimacy)

- showed up to a date drunk, acted annoyed we were even meeting (after we'd started to get closer)

- expressed desire and strong feelings once I/we ended the relationship 

- ghosted/slow faded

- no labels/clarity about the relationship 

- prioritised work/friendships/other commitments/anything else

- felt incredibly intense, high levels of sexual chemistry, roller coaster like, up and down/push-pull

- I felt driven by the wounded, vulnerable child parts of me which were getting repeatedly hurt, ignored and shamed (by myself as well as others)

- generally left me feeling as if I were annoying/demanding/overreacting/overly emotional


Secure partner

- Consistent communication, lets me know when unavailable

- Gives me a heads up when they sense they might need to cancel/change plans

- Has check ins about how we're feeling with each other/what we both want as the relationship progresses

- Slow, gradual increase in frequency of contact, dates and expression of feelings

- Attentive to my emotions/checks how I'm feeling

- Runs me a bath after an emotionally demanding work day, offers support

- Writes me cute notes, letters and little gifts

- Plans dates with me, then a weekend away, now a holiday

- Talks about the future with me

- Let me know they wanted to be my partner

- Responds to any (has been very slight) tension by wanting to understand and resolve it quickly, makes themselves available 

- Feels calm, comfortable, easy and passionate

- I don't feel highly emotionally reactive or triggered

- Leaves me feeling loved, cared for, relaxed, at home with them

- I feel in touch with the healthy adult parts of me and able to look after any vulnerable child parts myself, am a secure partner myself

In the top situations my anxiety felt haywire, I was emotionally dysregulated, I felt retraumatised, I thought everything was 'my anxiety', blamed myself and had a hard time detaching because it was addictive/I cared a lot about their pain and attachment difficulties and wanted to help them at the cost of myself.

In the secure situation, I feel great!

EDIT: Wanted to make clear that these were people with insecure attachment who were unaware/not on a healing journey. This is not a diss of avoidantly attached folks or intended as DA= bad, AP= good, no attachment style is bad. This is intended to show that anxiety is an understandable response to these behaviours and that it's possible to experience something different 💜",10yoswr,169,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10yoswr/differences_between_the_avoidants_ive_dates_and/,AnxiousAttachment,1

93,The biggest difference between dating secure men vs avoidant men,"Please let's not use this post to trash DAs. Insecure attachment is no joke so let's not paint everyone with one brush. Also there are many DAs making effort to get better and I want to akso acknowledge that. This post is just my experience and figured I'd share my take. I am sharing with the intention of showing you how things can be when you choose security over chasing an unavailable person (ideally one who isn't making effort; if you're with a DA who's making effort then it may not apply to you).

The biggest difference between my current partner (secure) and my ex (avoidant) is feeling as if I am part of someone's life. My boyfriend literally makes me feel like I am an active participant in his life. He shares things with me, involves me with his family and friends plans and he always checks up on me. When I get vulnerable with him, he matches the energy; at the very least, he comforts me. And I never worry about chasing him away because we become even closer afterwards. I actually feel like I am someone's GIRLFRIEND, not some person for convenience a couple of hours in the evening. Even when he's super stress and needs his space, I am not anxious at all. If anything I enjoy the alone time. It makes me miss him more.

My avoidant ex always made me feel like I was an after thought. Like I only mattered when he had the space for me. He was super quick to dismiss my need for more closeness and I felt VERY alone in the relationship.",t4bhae,168,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/t4bhae/the_biggest_difference_between_dating_secure_men/,AnxiousAttachment,1

96,Things I've learned about secure attachment from getting back together with an FA ex,"We've really been putting in work to understand each other and communicate better. I've been working a lot on my anxious attachment – both addressing my own insecurities as well as learning how to show up for myself more in relationships. I think we're in a genuinely healthy dynamic now, and I figured I'd share some of the insights I've learned and examples of how I practice this in my relationship. Would love any thoughts, feedback, criticism, etc. Also, for context, our previous issues were the anxious/avoidant chasing dynamic and co-dependency during the pandemic, so our solutions are trying to address those previous problems. 

1. **No unspoken needs/silent expectations –** When I am firm, clear, and consistent about my boundaries and needs, she is more than willing to meet them. What made her feel uneasy is when I didn't communicate my needs in advance and she failed to meet them. This made her feel like she was walking on eggshells because she didn't know what would make me upset. I also learned how to communicate my needs with respect – ""I would like to text you more frequently"" as opposed to ""Why don't you ever text me?"" When she isn't feeling on the defensive, she genuinely wants me to be happy and will do what she can to meet my needs.
2. **Space is healthy** – My partner genuinely enjoys spending time with me, but often sacrifices her needs for alone time until she gets overwhelmed. She's learned how to identify early warnings of her needs for space and communicate them to me before she gets stressed out, and I've learned to not take it personally. We also have planned ""nights off"" twice a week – this gives her guaranteed time to work on her own personal to-do list and decompress, and also gives me a chance to work on my hobbies, etc. without feeling anxious about spending time apart.
3. **Taking pauses in arguments** – She can't access her emotions in the moment when she feels triggered. If I keep pressing, it will activate her flight response. I've learned to just put a pause on a tough conversation, give her time to gather her thoughts, and more often than not, she will come back with a thoughtful and empathetic response. In my experience, **setting a fixed amount of time to return to the conversation isn't helpful** – she feels time-pressured which makes it hard for her process her thoughts. Also, I've learned to **not bring up tough conversations right before bed**, and that the maxim ""never go to bed angry"" doesn't just mean to force a resolution before sleeping (which will seldom reach the conclusion I want), but also to avoid bringing up tough conversations when she is tired.
4. **Learning about love languages –** for me, part of being an AA is that I want to be chosen in an over-the-top way so I can feel secure. Her family didn't show emotions, so she shows love through acts of service and quality time – she will drop whatever she is doing to spend time with me. Also, she approaches gift-giving in a different way. For her birthday, I made a casette tape with all the songs that reminded me of her, made a custom personalized lyric book, and bought her tape deck so she could listen to it – it took me hours to make and she loved it. She bought me a $30 portable phone charger from Amazon for mine. At first, it made me sad because it felt like she didn't put much thought into it, but then she brought up how much I always complained about my phone always being dead (I genuinely do this all the time) and that she spent a lot of time thinking about a gift that I could tangibly use every day that would solve a real problem in my life, as opposed to something that purely had sentimental value that I might not use very often. She loves in different ways and I've learned how to acknowledge and appreciate the way she shows it – just because it's different doesn't mean her love isn't equally as strong.
5. **Avoiding protest behaviors** – the hardest part was breaking out of the anxious/avoidant trap. When we were younger, I learned that shutting down and acting annoyed/disinterested would trigger a response in her to ""chase me,"" and instead of healthily communicating my problems when I was feeling anxious, I would resort to these. Instead, we've both practiced showing the love we want to receive – if I notice myself protesting and shutting down, I consciously try to stop these thoughts. If I want to text her, I text her – I don't play games about waiting to see if she notices if I'm not texting as much, I don't intentionally wait to respond to her messages. I love her the way I want to be loved, and I communicate if I feel like my needs aren't being met (within reason).

104,My Letter To The Anxiously Attached,"Dear you,

I know why you're here. You're here because you feel confused about anxious attachment. You're wondering, why does this come up for me? Why am I like this? Am I unloveable because I'm anxiously attached? The answer to all of this is to be kind to yourself and your journey. 

It's okay to be anxious. It's okay to be on edge. It's okay to be defensive. Just know that you are valid and trauma responses are present. You are worthy. You are not a broken person. Whether your earliest moments of abandonment was from childhood or in adulthood. There isn't a permanece to anxious attachment, it can be fixed. 

I've been going to therapy since 2019. My therapist is a godsend. She embraces me and tells me that in order to figure out what's going on, you have to go deeper. You have to find your why and make your worth YOURS. And that the person that is for you, won't bat an eye at your struggles but can be your safety. 

I've always had attachment issues since adolescence. It amplified with romantic relationships because of how I grew up/my infatuation with love due to media. I would always be left in situations whether relationships, friendships because of being ""too much ""too needy"" or ""too attached."" Growing up in a minority family as a female, it's always waiting for a man to make a first move. I didn't realize how detrimental that was. 

(TW: Suicide/ Self Harm) 

Being a teen, I had severe depression and suicidal tendencies. I always felt like I was annoying, unworthy, clingy, needy etc. 
Jumping to college, my self worth was revolved around the male gaze. It was a detriment to me in the end because instead of healing, I put a bandaid on it. 

It wasn't until my relationship with my ex that made me feel like I was ""too much & too emotional."" I was punished by silence, passive aggression, and manipulation. Being in emotionally abusive relationships can amplify that anxious attachment because you're fearful of losing them, you're scared your emotions are too much, they'll abandon you. And all you want them to do is stay and not leave. I just want to say, it's okay to not settle for less that what you actually deserve. Why? Because someone will be there for those rough times that question your worth. 

Anxiety has a huge part to play in anxious attachment. And the cocktail of disaster is not communicating and assuming vs asking. There will be days you'll be better, you'll feel grounded and making progress. Some days, you'll feel like your progress is nonexistent. I'm here to tell you, you got this. You can get past this glitch in our makeup. We are not unloveable and we are not unworthy of all the love we desire. 

Some affirmations that can help are these

You are worthy of all of the love 
You are not broken 
You are a work in progress 
You are going to be okay
You are worth being loved 
You are valued 
You are appreciated 
Your anxiety is a trauma responce and not forever. 

Now, I'm in a loving relationship with someone who understands me, who doesn't abandon me, and most importantly constantly reminds me that my trauma doesn't define me. I can keep loving and moving forward at the way I want to receive and accept love. And that, is a beautiful thing. 

I promise your, your love is not a burden.",13vcim3,151,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/13vcim3/my_letter_to_the_anxiously_attached/,AnxiousAttachment,1
105,Does anyone else struggle with emotional permanence?

I've noticed that I really struggle with this. 

Right now my only tool for this is to keep a log of facts (e.g. noting down kind/romantic things he's said or times when I felt particularly loved) that I can review when I'm really spiraling, and just trying to talk myself through it.

110,"What happened after one year dating my (32F) first secure boyfriend (31M), and what didn't happen.","My avoidant ex bf left me. I was devastated. After three months, I met my secure boyfriend. That's what happened:

**What happened:**

* I am not living in a permanent fight or flight response anymore, that means that my nervous system is calm most of the time.
* I can focus in my own life and I am not obssesed with my partner anymore. My life is less love foccused.
* I am able to communicate my needs on real time, without feeling the fear of them being too much.
* I can safely ask for reassurance when I need it.
* I feel very secure that we have a strong bond and he is not going to leave. We feel we are a team. Us against the world, instead of we against each other.
* I am not scared of being ""too romantic"", ""too intense"", ""too vulnerable"", or ""too childish"". I am just being myself, and my love, intensity, vulnerability and romance are accepted by my partner. He thinks I am very cute and he likes me the way I am. I don't feel like faking. I can tell him everything that is on my mind. I don't need to hide anything from him.
* We are moving together in 15 days. Everything came in a very natural way. We feel confortable with the increasing intimacy and trust. Like at home.
* I am still going to therapy and, now that I have a secure base, is much easier to work in my self love and my attachment trauma.
* I am happy and my self esteem is getting better everyday.

**What didn't happen:**

* I didn't heal magically, I still get dysregulated from time to time and I know I need to work on myself if I want to have a happy life. Love isn't everything and after the honeymoon period, hormonal happiness decreases a lot. So I have to work on building a fulfilling live.
* I still had trouble to self soothe. Is not like dating a secure partner made me feel secure all the time. He reassures me when I ask him for it, but I knew I couldn't depend on him all the time. I deserve to have the ability to self soothe, and he deserves to have a partner that doesn't need him all the time to regulate her nervous system. I started to work on that and, although it has been hard, I am doing much better now and both of us feel happier.
* I still struggled to comunicate in a healthy and honest way. We had to build a safe communication space, it didn't come by magic. At the beggining, I just felt to scared of communicating, so I avoided it all the time. I had to re-learn to do it from scratch and I failed many times. Now I am much better.
* We are not the perfect couple because perfection doesn't exit. We have a secure bond, but he doesn't act secure all the time, nor do I. Everyone has their own wounds, the difference is that we are working on healing them together.
* I still get anxious from time to time. Our bond is secure, but it doesn't mean I feel secure with him all the time. I still need to do self work and attachment trauma is something you always have to work on.
* I didn't just get bored because he is secure, that was a fear I had. I don't feel as infatuated as I felt in the past, but I can perfectly notice that this feeling was toxic and that I felt anxious all the time. Now I can see my ex for what he is and I don't like him at all. On the other side, I admire and love my partner for what he really is and I feel a beautiful and safe spark. I can see his flaws and I love him even deeper. I don't miss the feelings I had for my avoidant parnet at all. Now I am experiencing deep love and intimicy, and it feels so good.",yvwnki,146,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/yvwnki/what_happened_after_one_year_dating_my_32f_first/,AnxiousAttachment,1

113,becoming less anxious has literally killed my attraction to emotional unavailability,"Before I start, I want to share the biggest lesson I have learned since I started healing my anxious attachment: My needs are valid and it is okay for me to upset when they are not met. (This will make sense in the post).

I've been doing very well in my secure journey. Last month I started a personal challenge of showing up for myself more in my life and my relationships. Instead of suppressing my needs or protesting (which I rarely do), I was going to directly and confidently ask for my needs and also be receptive to the needs of others. I'm proud of the progress I've made since then and I can honestly say my anxiety has reduced drastically since I've taken better steps at secure behaviour.

The side effect? I'm losing more and more attraction towards my boyfriend, a dismissive avoidant I've been in a committed relationship with for four years now. Opening my eyes to my needs and taking better care of myself has made me realise how lonely I am in this relationship and how, for so long, I would blame myself or feel guilty for being upset when he pushes me away. While I have definitely contributed my fair share of issues to the relationship (lack of communication, keeping feelings to myself, walking on eggshells), there were many times I was very open about my desires, feelings, needs, and concerns. I would actively ask for what I wanted and we even broke up three times because of it. So it's not as if he was in the dark about who he was with and what I expected. Each time he came back stronger than ever and making more effort than ever and would promise me he would treat me better. And each time I foolishly ignored my intuition and all the signs HE gave me about his inability to be consistent, and at times even simply loving, with me. I cannot control his behaviour but I can control mine and I chose to stay, despite how much it was hurting me. I stamped myself as the one who always suffers and I used it as an excuse for not walking away.

However, since becoming less anxious I doubt walking away will be an issue because I'm not even attracted to him anymore. If I'm honest, I probably lost attraction a long time ago. I think what I thought was attraction towards him was just an addiction to intermittent goodness he would extend to me when he felt like it (or when he was horny). If I think about it, the goodness wasn't even that good. I was just hooked.

I used to have a drinking problem (it's under control now and I only drink occasionally with good limits). Looking back, most of those times I drank didn't even feel good. It was just my body that became hooked to wine. The good feelings of alcohol died with the first drink; the rest was just a topper to try and get the same high again. It's the same with APs and our ongoing attachment to (unaware) DAs who make it clear to us that we don't matter as much to them as they do to us. An example? Last month, I told him I missed him when he was away for two weeks. His response? ""I didn't think about whether I missed you or not."" And yet after this exchange I blamed myself. I thought I was the problem, not his emotional disconnectedness. I thought I was the issue, not our incompatibility. I thought I was wrong for even being upset at that statement. But even the most secure people would feel hurt if their partner basically said they didn't think about their partner for two weeks.

I don't even know how I managed to have sex with him! I don't even want to be near him now. Yet, only two months ago, sex was the only way I felt connected to him.

So if you want to know how to kill your attraction to emotional unavailability? Literally become secure.",t9cz9c,143,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/t9cz9c/becoming_less_anxious_has_literally_killed_my/,AnxiousAttachment,1

115,Anxious attachment is not an excuse to be an abuser,"I have to admit that I’m very disturbed on this sub sometimes when I see people justify straight up abusing their partners. Whether it’s monitoring internet usage, snooping, stalking, disrespecting sexual boundaries lashing out with verbally abusive insults, or pushing your partner to limit their life such as not seeing their friends or family.

Most people here rightfully guide OP’s who post about doing these things to more healed behavior, and most OP’s are looking to heal. But as a survivor of an abusive relationship with an anxious man who tried to cut me off from the whole outside world to have full time control over me, I straight up hate when people here support and enable behavior here that objectively meets the definition of abuse. 

Sharing your feelings with a partner is ok. Verbally abusing is not. Snooping is not. Asking them to cut down on platonic relationships is not. You don’t have a “need” to control your partner. That is not a valid need. Support, empathy, quality time, affection- valid needs. For your partner to stop normal, healthy aspects of their life bc they make you nervous, not a need. What you need is healing, bc you’re weaponizing therapy language to abusive ends. Even women can be abusers, gender isn’t a free pass. 

Here are signs of abuse. Either work to stop doing them, or end the relationship if you can’t be ok without doing these behaviors:

They are Hyper-Critical or Judgmental Towards You. ...
They Ignore Boundaries or Invade Your Privacy. ...
They are Possessive and/or Controlling. ...
They are Manipulative. ...
They Often Dismiss You and Your Feelings.",10qmmqa,143,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10qmmqa/anxious_attachment_is_not_an_excuse_to_be_an/,AnxiousAttachment,1

My partner and I had spent the whole weekend together, and I was already feeling a bit hyper anxious that he was getting tired of me. We’re also transitioning from the honeymoon phase I think and so that in general just makes me super anxious. Anyway, He mentioned he wanted to go to the gym that day before going to the beach, but didn’t say when. After breakfast he told me “he will be right back” and went outside without really telling me anything. I assumed he was getting something from the car and would be back immediately. Some time passed and I wondered if he had just left. I started to feel anxious about the thought. I walked outside and his car was gone, and immediately my mind flooded with every negative thought—“he didn’t kiss me goodbye, he wanted to get away from me. He didn’t care about me enough to tell me—“ and on and on. I became super emotional for a bit, but told myself I need to calm down. after calming down, I texted him and asked if he left to the gym. He said yes. My former self would have not texted back, waited angrily til he came back and either would have passively ignored him and been mad and distant the whole time or blown up. But instead I just said, “okay. Can you please tell me and kiss me goodbye next time?” And I explained I became emotional and understand he probably didn’t think much of it. He felt so bad and apologized and was extremely reassuring when he came back.

Even if you accept never having a deep level of reciprocity with them,  you are losing many of the key aspects that make a healthy relationship so fulfilling, such as reliability, consistency, availability, intimacy, safety, shared futures, physical and emotional support and more. Avoidants are unable to provide these things on a consistent and meaningful level.

After becoming secure yourself, you should make it a goal to find a secure partner if you want a relationship--or at least an avoidant who is changing and has demonstrated it.

The truth is, unless the avoidant is making strides to become secure, you will forever be stuck in an unfulfilling and unhealthy relationship that is predicated on you walking on eggshells and self soothing while they take a back seat and only come out in the rare chance they don't feel too insecure.",vppabn,140,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vppabn/its_sad_to_see_people_sacrificing_themselves_to/,AnxiousAttachment,1

122,Don't beat yourself up for your coping mechanisms and don't try to repress them to mimic healthy person behavior,"The most important thing in healing is not self care or alone time. It's learning to exercise understanding towards yourself instead of beating yourself up for ""not being normal"". When a child cries you don't tell it to shut up and behave, instead you find out what it wants and what it needs. Same with your own inner child. It cries because it's hurt and it's needs aren't met, because they weren't met since you were a literal child, not because it wants to be a nuisance, and treating it like a nuisance won't help anyone. Don't wonder what healthy people do because they are not you and they had a completely different life history. You need different care than healthy people. Which is not to say that you should demand others to accommodate you. Of course ideally everyone deserves a partner who will be understanding but most people aren't. But you will be far less affected by other's behaviour if YOU know that your feelings have a reason and make sense in the context of your life. But unlike a literal child, you are capable of understanding that you just can't have some things.

124,What I learned from dating a DA,"I thought this post might help people dating a DA.

They are afraid of conflict and emotions. This causes them to shut down and thus makes it hard to communicate. They usually 'deactivate' which in my experience lasts a few days or weeks. They usually won't reach out so you have to do it.


They like to be alone and have a lot of space, but they still want to think the person is there for them and understands them.


They prefer to do things on their terms. They may help you or be there for you but it will be their choice. One day they might be warm and kind, the next they might be cold and uncaring. For example one time my DA took me to the hospital when I was sick, the next time he dumped me on the side of the road and told me to take myself. 


They don't like to feel controlled or suffocated. If you want to share your needs saying something like 'I don't like it when you go days without texting me' is seen as a criticism and they will shut down. You have to speak in an open ended and positive way 'I enjoy it when someone messages me often' they will usually listen to these things and sometimes implement them if they don't feel like they're being forced to.


Hot and cold, sometimes they'll want to talk to you and be around you, sometimes they'll dissapear for days. In my experience if you send a calm non confrontational message, you will usually recieve a reply.


They come on strong at the start. It's not always love bombing though. For example my DA ex wanted to be friends as soon as we met, kept making suggestions of trips and places we could go to in the future when we had only just met. Over time they become more distant and focused on their own plans and hobbies.


They often cancel plans and meet ups. 


They usually have a history of relationships or sudden break ups. They also sometimes describe a perfect person that they want to marry (that doesn't exist).


 I don't know how common this is but my ex would try and think of ways we could be connected long term that wasn't emotional or romantic. For example he wanted me to rent his apartment that he owned, or start a business with him. He would always think of ways we would have to be in each other's lives long term that didn't involve emotional commitment. I felt like this was because he wanted me to stay in a non scary way.


They self soothe by isolating. This means they often don't understand that when you are upset you need them. If you message and call repeatedly they shut off more. If you want to be soothed by them it often won't happen. They see emotions and needing to be comforted as a weakness. They have learned to comfort themselves and isolate when upset. Therefore they don't know why you need it.


Privacy, My DA was very private. He would always come over to mine but didn't like me at his place. He rarely shared much about himself. or would mention a major life event months after it happened.


You are always the problem. You're too clingy, too needy and too emotional. DAs rarely register that their avoidance is triggering. The ending of the relationship is often sudden and they can cut someone off without really thinking about it for a long time. The end is often very cold. 


These are some of the things I learned. But at the end of the day you have needs too. I was constantly anxious when I was dating my DA and so was he. Because he would need the independence and space, which would push me away and make me more clingy. I spent a lot of time after the relationship trying to understand him which is why I wrote this post. I think all people are deserving of love and I know there are some people that will try and work it out with the DA. You may be putting in so much love and effort and thinking, why don't they appreciate this? well it's because it's uncomfortable them. Love and affection doesn't always make them warm and fuzzy it makes them annoyed if they're not in the mood for it. You don't have to sacrifice your need for connection to please the DA, but if that's what you want to do then I hope these tips help you, any questions let me know!",11lombg,137,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11lombg/what_i_learned_from_dating_a_da/,AnxiousAttachment,1
125,“Just find a secure” is not useful advice,"I know the book “Attached” says this, and I’ll tell you why I don’t agree. 

Normally a lurker but as an AP who had a (pretty) happy marriage to an avoidant, I thought I’d say something. 

1. That’s hard to nearly impossible for most AP’s over mid 20s. As the book says, secures settle down early and stay with their partners.  Some divorce and are widowed, but those traumatic life events also give people baggage that changes their style, so they may look AP or avoidant. 

1b. I’m dating other divorcée’s rn, and let me tell ya, even the more “secure” ones have plenty of issues that can trigger an AP, especially wanting to move very very slow with making a commitment after divorce. That can look like avoidance. 

2. Secures and AP’s are not often attracted to each other. People pick up subtle cues of style even on dating app pictures. It’s a tough way of dating to write off everyone who is…interested in you as not even an option. 

3. You’re gonna get in a relationship with someone whose life you relate to. A secure person who hasn’t had your trauma level may just not understand you. And you may not understand them. Not saying it’s a lost cause but if you look for only secures, you’ll be waiting a while. 

4. Secure people tend to lean either anxious or avoidant, and the avoidant leaning ones you will almost certainly be attracted to will become more avoidant if you’re anxious. So they are often misidentified as avoidant. You’re still in the push/pull dynamic if you don’t heal yourself. 

5. I’ve dated people of all styles, and ALL of them go through times of business, grief, depression. If you don’t have the fundamental tools to regulate when you’re partner is distant sometimes, you can sabatoge any relationship. 

It’s fine if you want to hold out for a securely attached person. You may be waiting a long time. If you want a secure person you have something in common with, you’ll be waiting longer. 

Imo much better choice for AP’s is to develop enough comfort that you are willing to be single for months, years, potentially your life if that’s how long it takes to meet a partner who TREATS you well. That could honestly be a person of any style. 

And it’s possible that person will still be kind of avoidant. For most AP’s, that is the case.",11wugp4,133,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11wugp4/just_find_a_secure_is_not_useful_advice/,AnxiousAttachment,1

127,"""You're So Easy to Talk to."" ""Thanks, that's just my anxious attachment.""","Last night a guy I've recently been on one (fun but not mind-blowing or anything) date with called me just to tell me how amazed he was by our date. He kept saying it was the best first date he's ever had and that he couldn't believe how easy I was to talk to.

I hear this (and a lot of love bombing-esque 'you're the most amazing woman I've met on this app, how are you single?' stuff) after pretty much every date I go on. Even when on my side the conversation didn't feel effortless at all. Even when it felt awkward to the point of being excruciating.

Talking to this guy last night, I realized that a lot of it is just the early hyper vigilance from AA. I am really tuned into people's feelings. I hate tension or conflict, so I tend to create a really harmonious feeling in all my conversations. It feels effortless to the other person but that's because I'm the one making all the effort!

How do I stop over-functioning like this on dates? I leave feeling validated because men tend to really enjoy dates with me, but also empty because I know it doesn't mean anything.

128,Anyone else thought they were fine and happy being single then met someone and all their anxious triggers were set off?,"I thought I was doing all the things one should do as a single person. Working on myself, starting a new hobby, flourishing in my career, working on things from past relationships so I could be ready for the next. I wasn’t necessarily needing a relationship though. I felt fine being single and just enjoyed being around family and friends.

I met someone and we instantly connected. A connection I don’t know if I’ve ever felt before, honestly. Things are complicated and it won’t work as a relationship and I’ve accepted that now but, all my anxious triggers were set off while in the midst of it. Like everything I’ve done in past relationships came flooding back. I thought I had improved myself in my time of singledom but, I guess not. It seems like they’re more avoidant as well so that may have played a factor. It’s actually what made me really look more into attachment styles as I definitely have an anxious attachment. I now have this attachment to this person that I’m trying to literally just block out and now I am not fine just going back to the single life.

I was given a taste of what an amazing connection feels like and now instead of working on myself again I just want to download the dating apps and find someone else that I can recreate that feeling with. Hell, I’ve even thought about reaching out to an ex ugh 

Anyone else experience this? I’m just not satisfied being single anymore even though I had been doing fine! I’m tired of the waiting and preparing myself and just would like someone now. It all got triggered by this situation ugh I know I need to work on this attachment thing but, honestly I don’t even know where to start.

129,how to reclaim sense of self when liking someone?,"so, on an intellectual/rational level, i've been doing a lot of the groundwork needed to be secure ever since my last breakup. i've been learning the art of letting go and letting people show me who they are and asking myself ""is this what i want?"" and making decisions from there. the only thing i can control is me, and the mentality is: take it or leave it. i'll be fine either way. this is all great and dandy in my mind but now that i'm in this situation, i feel my old habits and instincts creeping back....

i've been seeing someone for about 4 months? i would hardly call it dating. i really thought i was enlightened or something when i became interested in him because he was someone who i felt was ""right in front of me all along"" and ""always there for me."" i thought wow this is progress! liking a friend who is responsive, sweet, reliable and kind. i am always usually chasing avoidant people who feel far away or out of reach. now here is someone who is consistent and more importantly, someone i could trust before i knew him in a romantic context (this is significant bc my rose-coloured glasses go crazy when i start liking someone). 

things have been moving slowly and subtly, which is what i prefer (knowing that nosediving and rushing into these things has not yielded desirable results in the past). in the beginning, i liked that everything felt easy and i felt safe and assured - always enthusiastic in replies, down to hang out, making the first move. it felt mutual and i never doubted his feelings for me.

i don't know when the 180 happened, but it did. i also don't know if it's perceived distance or real distance, but we just talk and see each other less now. my automatic anxious response is that he's lost interest and the dreaded ""slow fade"" is what's happening. in the past, i'd just let ""what if"" scenarios take over, overanalyze every little thing and meaning, conjure up a narrative of rejection with no founded evidence, leading me to self sabotage and run away. but after a lot of time on this subreddit, i'm happy that i know an honest conversation is the only solution to this. some communication is MUCH needed. this whole time we never discussed what our intentions were and what was happening between us. i know the next time we meet, i have to bring this up with him. until then, i'll have to sit with all this anxiety .....and i guess i'm sick of it?

what i'm struggling with is how i give over so much power to someone else. i have to be in this limbo until i am either rejected or reassured and i don't want to live like that. my therapist pointed out that the more a person backs away, the more i put them on a pedestal. i'm watching myself fall back into the habit of chasing someone and never being able to catch up, self-abandoning and having it trigger my inadequacy. when this was supposed to be the person who had always liked and accepted me for me. i mourn my friendship with him a bit. i miss my balanced and grounded view of him, when it felt like my self-worth wasn't in his hands and trying to get his approval didn't feel like this urgent and catastrophic thing. i haven't spoken to him for a week because i've been feeling hurt and wanted to give myself space for that. and he hasn't initiated or reached out either, making me feel shittier about the situation. i kind of wish i had enough self-respect to walk away before needing someone to spell it out for me. and not because of my fear of rejection, but just knowing what's best for me and honoring that. having less tolerance for mixed signals and emotional unavailability. like i can't tell at this point if i actually like this person or i've just made him this figure i need validation from? anything to remember or ask myself to distinguish this? 

maybe my question is, when you're activated: how do you come back to reality? how do you get clarity again? (also how should i deal with the rejection, if it happens? 😪)",146j7p4,132,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/146j7p4/how_to_reclaim_sense_of_self_when_liking_someone/,AnxiousAttachment,1

131,Had a breakthrough with my therapist.,"The reason why I fast-forward in terms of dating is because I’m trying to milk as much as I can out of it before they inevitably leave. And yes, they will actually leave. Not because there’s anything obviously wrong with me, but because they feel drained from all of the taking I’m doing. I realize now that whatever I thought was me being a good friend/girlfriend/etc. was very surface-level—no amount of baked goods or cuddles can really compare to how much I am actively draining the emotions of others just so I can get some of those sweet, sweet happiness chemicals my brain produces. Yada yada yada, if I truly believed good things about myself—enough to motivate me to do the things that would make me happy—I wouldn’t need to drain people anymore and I could actually have healthy relationships. So yeah, anxiously-attached people can kind of be “energy vampires” and that’s probably why nobody stays for long.

There’s much more to it, but that’s all I’m writing for now. Now that I am more aware, I will start working on myself in a way that actually counts.",t8xml4,131,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/t8xml4/had_a_breakthrough_with_my_therapist/,AnxiousAttachment,1

And maybe I do, but it turns out that with the right person, it does not matter. I don't ever feel as if the way I feel is wrong or I worry too much about the relationship. My anxious attachment arose in part from dating people who did not want to be in relationships, or who were unkind to me. Now I'm three years in with someone lovely, and sometimes I even wonder if I'm anxious at all.

I’ve always felt like a burden to my parents and I’ve been cheated on in the only 2 relationships I’ve been in. I feel like my view of loved is so fucked. I feel like I’m so hard to love. 

I ruined something I potentially had with someone today, because I got paranoid that he lost interest/has not been consistent with communication. I just sound so fucking crazy and I hate myself for it (screenshot for reference). I’m confused if I’m doing this because I’m still suffering from childhood trauma or if I ‘deserve better’. 

I irrationally deleted bumble and hinge after. I deciding to spend more alone time to work in growth. It’s honestly been a year since I’ve even cuddled with someone on purpose to work on growth.

But a crumb..a morsel of attention was all it took. A likkle acknowledgment and all is well in the world. Pathetic.

However other times I’m overwhelmed with anxiety about our relationship, am insecure and triggered, and I don’t feel supported. 

Sometimes I feel like he’s giving me nowhere near enough reassurance, and he’s not being that attentive or supportive. But I struggle to tell how much of this is my anxious attachment screaming for more attention from him.

I’m torn between the part of me that wants to break up, and the part of me that thinks this is completely a me-problem and I need to work on myself and stay with him.

146,I can’t say this enough: date multiple people!,"if you make sure to date multiple people, you’ll be less likely to obsess over whether one person is texting you back or has lost interest, because you’ll know you have other options. you’ll be quicker to drop someone when they treat you badly. you’ll also be less likely to settle for someone who is avoidant or has a ton of red flags out of a fear of loneliness, because you’ll have other options you can compare with and decide who treats you best. it gives you back the power in dating that your anxiety takes away.

this is the best tool for the anxious person in dating. it might not seem appealing when you’re the type to over-invest after the first date and lose interest in seeing anyone else, but this is actually most helpful to that kind of person. over-investing is a normal response to only dating one person because they are your only source of romantic attachment. however, this isn’t healthy to do with someone you’ve just met because you don’t know yet whether they’re right for you or not. you have to power through those excited feelings after that one good first date and get back on the dating apps to meet someone else too. then, if things go downhill with that person later, you won’t be desperate to make things work out of a lack of other options.

as anxious people we tend to put all our eggs in one basket, and then be crushed whenever it doesn’t work out. we’re flooded with feelings of abandonment and we cling on to the person even if they’re not compatible with us at all. having multiple people to diffuse these attachment feelings in the tough early weeks of dating really helps lessen your anxiety and obsessive thoughts.

I know it’s probably getting annoying seeing me in the comments of every post about dating recommending that the op see multiple people until they meet someone ready for commitment, but I just can’t stress it enough. dating is a numbers game and if you can maximize the number of people you meet, you maximize your chance of finding a secure person you connect with who treats you well and wants to commit to an exclusive relationship with you. so give it a shot!",keyrvp,120,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/keyrvp/i_cant_say_this_enough_date_multiple_people/,AnxiousAttachment,1

i.e if they don't text me I don't text them. Only show as much enthusiasm as they're showing. Etc. 

The downside of being myself is the pure embarrassment and regret of how much attention I gave them that comes if I end up getting rejected.

153,Be cautious about viewing every relationship through the lens of Attachment Theory,"While we all have Attachment styles, sometimes it's easy to get sucked into overanalyzing someone's behavior to determine whether they're AP/DA/FA/whatever.

Our behaviors are not always exclusively driven by our core wounds or our childhood. Yes, many of them are. But sometimes you just don't mesh with a person. Or they don't mesh with you. You don't have enough in common. They're busy with their lives and don't have the energy to connect with you or be friends with you. They might hate that you have one extra toe.

As APs, I think we are more likely to go down a rabbit hole of trying to put every text message, conversation, or behavior into a box so that we know where we stand. But don't expend all of your energy on it.

Many are self-aware and we have to give people credit for trying to heal themselves. But let's be real for a bit here. Most of us in this sub who suffer in relation are usually dating emotionally unavailable people (with someone who is either unaware or just unwilling to make the effort). So this post is for those who are in that situation.

If you are staying in your relationship or situationship because you hope that, with just enough love and patience, they're going to reach that epiphany moment where they suddenly feel bad for pushing you away and want to make a change: forget about it. Just forget about it. It's not going to happen. That's not how human behaviour works (tried and tested, TRUST ME on this).

I want you think about how hard it is to heal *yourself*. How many setbacks, how many relapses, how many times we protest even when we are fully aware of what we are doing. And remember, anxious people often feel more incentive to fix themselves (not my words, my therapist himself told me that anxiously attached people are more likely to seek healing than avoidantly attached people. He said the clients who quit therapy earlier are often avoidant clients who are unable unable handle the emotional pressure of healing. No judgement, just the way it is). Now imagine how hard it must be for a self-aware avoidant partner to go through the same healing journey. And bare in mind, change is personal. It can't be for someone else.

How then do you expect your unaware or unwilling partner to suddenly wake up one day and give you what you need? The more you try. The worse they treat you. And they only show up for you when you walk away. But why should you only experience true love in distance? Isn't love supposed to be close?",tdvllz,116,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/tdvllz/please_stop_romanticised_the_idea_that_your_da/,AnxiousAttachment,1

161,To prevent is better than to cure (when possible),"We all know how much it sucks to be drawn into a seemingly normal relationship only for our partner to do a sudden U-turn, blindsiding us with detachment and neglect. At that point, we're invested and attached and it can be hell to manage to get out of the situation. We had no way to predict this would happen and it's perfectly legitimate to feel angry and deceived. These situations are not what this post is about.

But there are other occasions when we do get warnings that a relationship will likely be torture, and in those cases, it's important to pay attention so we can avoid getting involved from the start.

**Example**. In the past, when I was inexperienced and naive, I got infatuated with a guy who did all the right things but, as soon as he slept with me, said he 'didn't do commitment' and 'wasn't looking for anything serious' but we 'could keep hanging out (sleeping together) and see'. I thought that was totally normal at the beginning, that things would progress if we were a good match, and why wouldn't we be when we had 'such a great connection'? And I 'liked him sooo much!', I wanted to love and be loved, so hope was better than nothing. So I happily carried on. Lo and behold, I got attached and eventually wanted to deepen the relationship, while the good behavior he'd used to lure me in vanished, the 'great connection' turned out to be an act he put on with all girls, and he still had zero interest in me or anything more than sex.

I repeated this pattern multiple times, never understanding that I was trying to will into existence a relationship when I had been TOLD outright from the start there was no chance. And in the years I suffered from anxiety after my father's sudden death, I developed anxious attachment too which made these situations HELL because I constantly wondered what I did wrong, why I wasn't 'good enough' for them, and my self-esteem was non-existant until they gave me a breadcrumb of validation that I was lovable. Surely if I tried harder they would see how special I was and love me back? That would finally prove to myself that I was 'good enough' for someone, anyone, and wasn't inferior to all the other girls they were involved with.

&#x200B;

**Where did I go wrong? Let's count the ways.**

1. I wasn't clear on what I wanted. I just wanted to love and be loved but wasn't able to articulate 'I want a loving, committed relationship' even to myself.
&#x200B;

2. I wanted to 'be cool'. These guys had a great way of hinting that a 'cool girl' was one who'd let anything fly, never have any expectations or basic standards. Only someone totally lame goes around looking for ""a relationship"", I was a cool girl, 'connection' and 'having fun' without 'nagging' or strings attached was the way to go!

&#x200B;
3. I was inexperienced and naive. I thought everyone was open to a honest, loving relationship if only they 'met the right person', that everyone was kind, and that everyone would naturally grow to care for another person over months of spending time together (because I do). I had no experience of anything different.
&#x200B;

4. So I didn't take their words to heart. I thought that's just what everyone says upon meeting someone new. Things would develop organically with no need for uncool 'labels' or 'definitions'. After all we were *practically* in a relationship, why was I getting so hung up on technicalities? I should just 'go with the flow'.

&#x200B;
5. And they were, of course, never totally straightforward about it. They would keep breadcrumbing little hints that they 'totally could' fall for me 'one day'. Future-fake. Drop a sweet text every now and then. Give just enough empty words to keep me hoping.

&#x200B;
6. When anxiety got thrown in the mix, there was a whole psychological dynamic at play to keep me desperately hooked because I *needed* it to work out to soothe my core wounds of being unlovable and 'not good enough'. I knew nothing about anxious attachment and was totally unaware of what was going on in my subconscious so I wasn't focusing on healing myself at all.

&#x200B;

So essentially, even though I had been 'lucky' enough to receive a clear warning that the relationship was doomed from the start, I wasn't able to see it for what it was, I didn't believe it because I didn't **want** it to be true, and I clung to the breadcrumbs rather than face the massive boulder blocking the way. I was too enamoured with my hopes and fantasies to face the disappointing reality.

So, now that I'm more experienced, more informed, and thankfully back to my original secure state, what am I doing differently to try and prevent such situations whenever possible?

1. I'm clear on what I want, at last. Yes, I want a loving, committed relationship with a partner who's all in, who loves me, who is sure he wants to be with me, who's proud and excited to be with me, who isn't afraid of commitment. No maybes or waffling or let's see how it goes. If it's not a yes, it's a no and I want better than that.

&#x200B;
2. I honor my wants and needs and know they are valid and okay. I don't question whether they're 'normal' or 'acceptable' as if needing authorization for wanting what I want. I'm not 'too demanding' or maybe 'should settle'. They're MY needs and they're non-negotiable for ME, and that's all that matters.

&#x200B;
3. I accept that not everyone is going to be a match for those needs. If they're not, that doesn't mean I should 'tone it down' and settle for less in order to cling on to a person who's not a good match for me. Even if we have 'such a great connection' and I 'like them so much'. It doesn't matter, they're still not a match for a relationship and it WILL end up making me suffer. I should move on and keep looking for someone who IS a match.

&#x200B;
4. Working on developing an **abundance mindset** is essential. No, this isn't the last person in the world that will ever pay attention to me or that I will ever like, and if I miss this chance I'll die alone. And even if it was, there's still no point in trying to force a relationship with someone unsuitable because it's just not going to work anyway no matter how much I want it to.

&#x200B;
5. I try to focus on actions as opposed to words. If they say the right things but their actions tell a whole other story, it's the actions I should believe because talk is cheap. Even when the words are the ones I *want* to believe. Even when I *desperately* want to believe them just so I can keep hoping. Journaling helps be more objective.

&#x200B;
6. I worked a lot on 'radical acceptance', which means you strive to see and accept the reality for what it is, rather than stay in denial and fight against it because you don't *want* it to be true and want your rosy fantasy to be true instead. Rather tha negotiating that if you only did this differently or he did that differently, then everything would be fine. It's like grieving: you have to go through the stages of grief for the death of the illusion you had about the person and the relationship. Finally accepting the reality is hard as hell, and I often didn't want to do it because it meant giving up on my dream, but it's the only way out.

&#x200B;
7. Most importantly, **to prevent is better than to cure: when you have warning from the start that a situationship is a dead end or will be toxic for you, don't engage in the first place.**

If someone is actually stating outright that they don't do commitment, only want FWBs or anything of the like, **drop them**. Listen to them and believe them. Heed the warning.

No 'I should play it cool and go with the flow'. No 'maybe I expect too much'. No 'maybe they will develop feelings over time'. No 'but we have such a great connection'. No 'I can prove to them how amazing I am and they will change their mind'. No 'but they sent me a heart emoji, that must mean they love me deep down inside and are just too scared and wounded to admit it'. No 'maybe they're just avoidants but we can fix it together'. No 'but I really really really like them'.

Pay attention to any warnings and when you see them, walk away while you're still minimally attached. Don't enter with your eyes wide open a situation you already know will be shitty. Preventing the pain altogether is way better than having to pick up the pieces of yourself later on when you've been hurt, especially for AAs who get hurt even more by such situations because their core wound gets triggered.

And lastly, 8) I try to be realistic and understand I'm not an exception. It happens that a relationship might eventually grow out of something casual, but I'm not going to bet on the illusion that my case will be one of these rare exceptions. Also because,

9) If someone only ever had short flings, if someone sleeps around with dozens of Tinder matches, if someone has a track record of being a bad partner I will not be the exception because **it has nothing to do with me and everything to do with who they are as a person**. Surely they've met great potential partners before, and they still behaved the way they behaved because **that's who they are** regardless of who they are dating. They were like that before me, they were like that with me, and they sure as hell aren't going to magically get better for the next woman because she's sooo perfect.

&#x200B;

Hope this endless ramble can be useful to someone. It was really therapeutic for me to type it out, too. I've made all these mistakes and I know I could make them again in a moment of loneliness / weakness. Hopefully having it written down will help me remember it.",sysy4j,114,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/sysy4j/to_prevent_is_better_than_to_cure_when_possible/,AnxiousAttachment,1
162,Practiced putting up good boundaries today,"I’ve been seeing a girl for a few weeks and she’s been seeming less and less interested. Old me would obsess over her or maybe even indulge in protest behavior by not texting her on purpose.

I texted her saying that this isn’t going to work for me, and that I want someone who I can spend more time with and doesn’t text every three days. And that she’s fun to hang out with but it’s just not a good match. It really sucks because I was pretty into her, but it’s just not worth it.

163,When unintentional abuse from an anxious partner becomes intentional...,"I understand that people with insecure anxious attachment styles experienced certain types of traumas and behaviors during their childhood and adult life that made them become that way. I get it. At some point once the individual in question is aware that their behaviors are hurting another I feel that is when the abuse they are unintentionally committing becomes intentional. 

Some emotionally abusive behaviors that I have seen from anxious attachments that are quite damaging include:

-Smothering a partner by demanding constant companionship without respecting boundaries.

-Jealousy towards anyone your partner likes and acts upon that jealousy by exhibiting protest behaviors. 

-Protest behaviors that include bombarding a partner with calls/texts even when they do not answer. (I.e. harrassment)

-keeping score then ""punishing"" their partner for not meeting their unrealistic metric of back and forth communication 

-using empty threats of leaving and other forms of manipulation when their partner doesn't act the way they feel they should

-Using blame and guilt to make their partner feel bad for not meeting their needs even when those needs are unreasonable 

In my opinion, when you become aware that you are exhibiting these behaviors and your partner is telling you that your behavior is causing massive problems it is your job to stop doing them or else it is now going into intentionally abusive territory. Your partner has made you aware that what you are doing is destructive, it is hurting them, and it is making them feel uneasy but you continue to push boundaries. 

It is not your partner's job to heal your traumas or behaviors. It is time to take accountability and work with a mental health professional to heal so you will stop the emotional abuse. I suggest therapy to anyone who is now aware that their behaviors are causing emotional pain and anxiety for their partners. It isn't fair to your partner to keep doing these things whether you can help yourself or not. Trauma isn't an excuse to not try to be a better person in your relationships. It's time to do and be better.",x7kr5m,111,130,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/x7kr5m/when_unintentional_abuse_from_an_anxious_partner/,AnxiousAttachment,1

165,Realizing you've been the bad guy for most of it,"I don't see a lot of posts around here talking about some bad shit that this attachment style can make you do. So I'm going full honest here.

I have been with my partner for 3.5 years. As of right now I would say he's secure, in the past he was secure leaning avoidant, meaning that while he's normally secure, under a lot of stress he would show some avoidant behaviors, in particular he would have a hard time processing his emotions and talking about them. He's been in therapy for 2 years now for this and he has shown immense improvement. I have an extremely anxious attachment plus OCD, depression and some fun childhood trauma. I have been in therapy for years but had to change a few times because finding someone in my country that can tackle these issues together is kind of hard.

This the thing. He made mistakes and I also did. But he always put an effort and his avoidance has never pushed him too far. He would kind of shut down emotionally, we’d fight and then make peace. I truly wish I could say that about me.

I have been a boundary overstepper. I have always called him right after fights when he said he wanted space.

I have always found excuses for my behavior but I never found excuses for him. I would be so harsh when he acted avoidant but never brought the same expectations on me.

I textbombed when I knew he was spending quality time with people he loved.

I have sometimes lost trust in a person that has never given me even a small reason to be worried.

I lashed out because of really, and I mean really unwarranted jealousy. 

I once started bawling because he wasn't ""connecting emotionally with me"" since he was processing a very big  traumatic family thing that happened a few days before and wouldn't have a happy smile on his face and just wasn’t in the mood to talk understandably.

I almost passed out once from the panic because he hadn't been answering my texts for an hour.

I have made him feel guilty for things no one should feel guilty for and I can see it in his behavior and it breaks my heart.

I now handle my anxious attachment a lot better than before, even though the extreme anxiety is still there. I'm not writing this to fish for sympathy, I'm writing this because if you have done something like this and you're ashamed to talk about it, just know that you're not alone. I am extremely ashamed of what I've done just to soothe my anxiety. I also honestly think that I could have BPD. 

But yeah, avoidance can make people do very bad things but I think I'm living proof that having anxious attachment is really no joke.

EDIT: I am shocked at the heartwarming response this post received. Thank you all for the kind words. Some people correctly reminded me that also my partner made mistakes, and that’s 100% true! The point of this post was to really taking in what I did, because I’ve always been very focused on what he did wrong, not realizing how many times I went too far.",u30sr3,113,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/u30sr3/realizing_youve_been_the_bad_guy_for_most_of_it/,AnxiousAttachment,1

170,"Every time a DA posts on this sub, people straight up abuse them","Edit: I’m actually pretty convinced after reading the comments here that this space is just not aligned with my idea of a healthy community so I will simply unsubscribe. 

It’s toxic as hell. Whether it’s a comment or a post, people just feel completely comfortable saying horrible, vile, things. “You should never be in a relationship.” “You’re a robot.” Or some version of that DA should be willing to accept any level of AP lashing out or abuse.

I will prob not date another DA in my life, bc our needs are too opposite.But this sub has really confirmed for me that AP’s are just as bad. Given being neglected by a dismissive partner or berated by a codependent one, I choose neither. 

The anti DA stuff has just gotten out of control lately. All the posts conflating DA’s with narcissists, people calling DA’s robots. Ironically, all while saying DA’s lack empathy. Look in the mirror. 

This sub has at times been a very supportive space where people are interested in healing but it feels like the toxicity is winning out. It was very useful on my journey to being mostly secure. But I look at the other attachment subs and people are interested in healing. I wish we could have something like that here. 

A lot of people here don’t want to recognize the hard truth that secure people are basically never abusive to their partners. Secures aren’t looking for a justification for why it was ok to abuse in this one instance bc the person really deserved it. I have in my attachment journey learned to walk away from partners who make me feel consistently terrible, and with partners who don’t, talk about my feelings without berating or abusing the other person. I wish and hope that for everyone here.",11vv5tw,106,145,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11vv5tw/every_time_a_da_posts_on_this_sub_people_straight/,AnxiousAttachment,1

172,I think I did it! I found someone who’s secure!,"**Edit:  Oh my gosh you are all so lovely!!! Thank you for the love and support.  It really made my day! :)**

Hi all ! I (25F) have an anxious attachment style and have fallen into the anxious-avoidant trap in my previous two long term relationships.


It was exhausting.  I never knew where I stood in those relationships.  Any time I tried to have any sort of serious conversation with them, they distanced themselves.  Both of my exes were also 10 years older than myself, so there also was an imbalanced power dynamic present.


I promised myself I’d stay away from avoidants from now on.  I read a couple books on attachment theory and felt well equipped to begin dating again.  


Well, I met someone and I believe he’s secure (and he’s my age!).  For the first time in my adult life, I don’t feel like I’m the one chasing the other person.  We are equally chasing one another and it’s like a breath of fresh air.


I don’t wait on the edge of my seat for him to message me.  He always initiates conversation if I don’t.  I never feel like I’m asking too much from him.  And he’s always making time for me each week and asking me on dates.  When I talk about him meeting my family, there’s excitement in his eyes.  


Last night he looked at me and asked, “can we make this official?”.  This was the **first** time I haven’t needed to be the one to initiate this conversation.  I’m over the moon.


I can’t believe this is what I’m experiencing right now.  After all this time feeling anxious and like I was begging for affection… all this time it *could* have been this easy.  I do hope that I’m not misreading this all (I still get anxious that maybe I am).


I just wanted to share this with you all.  I know how exhausting the anxious-avoidant trap is.  It takes a lot of work to overcome the difficulties of those relationships.

173,How do you forgive yourself for your mistakes because of your anxiety,"My boyfriend just broke up with me because I couldn't give him the space he needed without my fear of abandonment kicking in which would cause me to send him messages after messages. The last nail in the coffin was when I was trying to protect myself from the perceived hurt so I asked him if he'd like to break up but shortly regretted it and deleted it afterwards. 

I know I self-sabotaged real hard in just a span of a month. It was so difficult to see on hindsight when you are directly involved in the relationship but now that I can see it through a different perspective, I've seen how destructive my anxieties could be. 

How do you forgive yourself after all this? I know APs tend to blame themselves for everything but its just so hard when it seems like it is all your fault afterall.

176,"Boyfriend never called me back tonight, using all my coping skills to prevent anxiety from taking over.","I’m a little proud, because I haven’t cried/spiraled as I usually do, although I cannot think of anything else but him and have not been able to do anything else tonight but lie around waiting for his call. I needed to cook and fold laundry but instead I made popcorn and left my clean clothes in the hamper. Why am I like this?

My bf thought I was working late, so he called me earlier and left me a cute voicemail which made me happy, *but* I wasn’t working late today so I called him back not long after that and he didn’t respond. I texted him that I’d try him again later tonight and he replied he thought I was working late, but when I called him tonight no answer again.

I don’t necessarily think he’s cheating (I have an AA based worry but not a real worry), but I do think he’s purposely avoiding my call/calling me back. This happened last week and I texted him good night and he immediately called me and said “sorry I was in the bathroom when you called and then got distracted.” I’ve already explained to him before that not hearing from him flares up my anxiety and he’s been super sympathetic and reassuring about it. I know he always has his phone on him, so it hurts to know he can’t just give me a call back. I was just with him for 6 days straight so maybe he needs a little alone time from me but a “good night” would’ve been nice at the very least… I hate not hearing from him and he makes me feel super unimportant the second we are not physically together, despite his reassurance that he’s always thinking of me.

I’ve been deep breathing, hanging out with my family, watching fun videos online, a few coping mechanisms to get my mind off it, but I need more I guess.

177,When the DA comes back: a warning,"We broke up two months ago after 4 years. I ended it, requested for no contact and he seemed more than happy with that. Three weeks later, he calls me and asks for another chance. Tells me he messed up and wants a future with me and even told me he signed up for counseling. I was hesitant to take him back and even expressed this to him. He insisted he knows his issues now and wants us to make it work. Against the advice of my own therapist and friends, I took him back. The first 4 weeks were great, he was the nicest he'd ever been to me and even my friends seemed more supportive. This weekend I asked him how he felt about our future.

He was vague, second guessing himself and when I reminded him of our promises, he snapped at me and told me to give him space. I dumped there and then and I blocked him. He tried coming over once and I sent him away and wished him well.

PEOPLE DO NOT CHANGE UNLESS **THEY** WANT TO.

I wasted 4 years and even after he sought help, he still pushed me away. Its not going to work! Focus on healing yourself and meet someone secure. PLEASE.

178,Anxious attachment to a player gave me so much insight into the psychology of anxious attachment,"I was pursued for months by a guy I knew had a reputation for being a player. Eventually, I started to entertain it and I found myself falling for him and being pulled into the uncertainty of the situation. He led me on under the assumption that he was open to a relationship, then switched one day and said he didn’t want any labels. 

Due to my attachment issues, I just couldn’t let go so I agreed to a FWB arrangement which was a huge mistake. 

I think the worst thing about the anxious attachment style is you can sometimes scare yourself with the amount of autonomy and self-control you lose to situations like this. It can leave you in very emotionally dangerous situations because you’ve lost that fundamental ability to say no to bad treatment. 

Also, I’ve realised that you can never enter relationships on an equal footing with the other person because you will too quickly start to ‘care’ more and it ruins the dynamic. It’s important to keep in mind, however, that you don’t actually care, it’s literally just an activated attachment style and it could happen with a lot of people. The person you’re obsessing over isn’t unique in any way, they’ve just happened to flip the switch to a deep psychological struggle you have. 

However, there are solutions. I’ve recognise that there’s actually a lot to be learnt from the dismissive attachment style, and some of their behaviours might be valuable for us to implement in our own lives and achieve the goal of becoming more secure. Having a more removed attitude to relationships can help you think rationally and make better decisive decisions.

179,Hope: Finally found peace of mind after breakup,"5 weeks ago I finally broke up with my FA that I was in an on & off situationship with for 1 1/2 years. Obviously since it's been on & off it's taking some time to see if this is for real but I'm pretty sure that it is.

I definitely still love him but I just got exhausted of being on the roller coaster. I've been in love with 2 DAs before and this was a much bigger rollercoaster than those. Receiving hot & cold flipflopping for so long became unbearable. I realized as much as I loved him I needed to be able to just have peace of mind again.

I felt some relief a few days after the breakup but my brain was still in adrenaline mode for weeks still expecting to swing between emotional extremes. A month later my brain seems to be more stable and spending a lot less time in flight, fight mode.

I could write a novel about that relationship but as for when you're ready to leave a dysfunctional anxious avoidant trap, you leave when you're ready. Not when your friends tell you you should leave. You leave when you've tried everything and realized that there is no hope that things will change if you stay.

You'll also probably have a few failed attempts to leave before you finally follow through. My FA improved each time we broke things off but only just enough not to lose me.

For a few months I gave him a lot of space and resisted my urges to chase. And he grew much closer but his capacity for intimacy is limited and the level of closeness he is able to have without tackling his avoidant attachment wasn't enough for me. 

I also realized that while he knew I would come back for just breadcrumbs he would never really have to confront his attachment wounds. He's never *really* had to confront losing me until now. Before he sensed that while I would pout and stay away for weeks at times that I would settle for minimal improvements.

What changed was that I became much more securely attached. I started communicating my needs, enforcing boundaries more, and finally became very clear on what it would take to stay together. I followed through on ending things when he did not address what I told him were my basic needs that I couldn't do without.

It's painful to leave someone you love but it's far more painful to stay and be given only breadcrumbs and only get a glimpse of what your future could be if only they do the work. But you realize that future will never be unless they finally change and heal themselves & they are currently unwilling to.

In a final note my FA had commented repeatedly on how impressed he was with how much I had changed and matured. (He sensed me healing my anxious attachment.) I can only hope that I planted a small seed that might inspire him change is possible for him too. 

I also learned to have healthy compassion for him. He is an FA bc he has a lot of internal conflict. His treatment of me reflects his treatment of himself. It's not an excuse to continue to abandon myself but it has helped me really understand the avoidance is not about me but something within himself.

Edit: Update: I maintained no contact for 2 months and unlike the past times I've gone NC with him it wasn't hard. This week I finally blocked his phone number for first time. We ran into each other twice in last month. First time he was pursuing me and the last time he was back to avoidant deactivation. The final straw was a phone call were he denied we had a romantic entanglement of some kind. I told him to leave me alone & that I was blocking his number. That only took almost 2 years to do. Friends suggested I block him as soon as 2 months in.",15foyyk,106,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/15foyyk/hope_finally_found_peace_of_mind_after_breakup/,AnxiousAttachment,1

181,sometimes I forget the second half of healing is being in a relationship 🥴,"Lol I keep telling myself ""I WONT DATE UNTIL I FIX MYSELF 😤"". And while it does help to be alone and work on yourself, I'm using this as a way to avoid relationships and the pain that comes with it. 

The only way I can practice self soothing is if I come across a situation that would require it, which is in relationships. I rarely get upset with my friends or become clingy with them. So the only time I would have to practice self soothing is with a partner. 

Maybe casual dating is something I would give a try with later. Even if it leads to nothing serious, that's fine because I'm practicing the skills it takes to be in a healthy relationship. 

I noticed with each time I've gotten abandoned, I've gained more resilience to it. I'll never forget when I got so fed up with a guy being disrespectful that I blocked him. I expressed multiple times that his behavior was hurting me and he did nothing. So when he did it again, I said nothing and blocked him.

With my last ex, even though it took me getting ghosted 4 times, I'm shocked that i haven't spiraled for that long. Usually it takes me 3 months to get over someone. But right now I'm functioning just fine. Within 3 weeks I was okay again.

183,sex as a way to validate self worth,"does anyone else with anxious attachment find themselves using sex as an effective way to validate self worth? i only feel this way when i'm in a relationship, when i'm not and they're just hook ups it normally leaves me feeling empty. i of course don't only have sex with my boyfriend to validate myself, but it does make me feel a lot more valued and if i'm in the mood to have sex and he isn't, my mind spirals and i start to think something is wrong with me. sometimes i think this leads me to be hyper sexual. i don't know if its due to past relationships always wanting sex from me, even when i didn't necessarily want to but did anyways seeing how satisfied it made them. it just makes me feel like they love me and helps ease my insecurities i have over myself.",12ar6a9,103,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/12ar6a9/sex_as_a_way_to_validate_self_worth/,AnxiousAttachment,1

189,The BIGGEST tip for finding healthy partners.,"To find a healthy partner, it's not so much about searching for them as much as it is about filtering out the bad choices. When we are faced with rejection or met with unreciprocated efforts, our anxious instinct is to chase them and fix things. Even as a fairly secure former-AP, I still feel this often. 

A healthy, amazing and blossoming relationship is formed when you meet someone who will share your effort, love and values. You want someone who will talk to you as often as you talk to them, you want someone who does things as much as you do for them, you want someone who wants you. 

 You are allowed to initiate a date or two but that's it, if they aren't mirroring your interest after a few dates then it's best to let go. DONT CHASE PEOPLE. Chasing doesn't make people want you, instead it gets you rejected, manipulated and only temporarily soothes your anxiousness. Instead, wait for them to call back and if they do, that's the bare minimum for a healthy relationship. 

As cliché as it sounds, if it's meant to be, it WILL be. A relationship you have to pursue is not worth pursuing.",wvq7o7,105,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/wvq7o7/the_biggest_tip_for_finding_healthy_partners/,AnxiousAttachment,1

191,Tip #1: Don't make them the center of your universe,"Recently someone I was seeing casually but for over a year broke up with me. I've of course been ruminating about it a lot, but today I had an epiphany: most of the problems that we had were due to the fact that I made him the center of my universe.

He didn't ask for it, but I did it because I liked him and I genuinely enjoyed interacting with him, spending time with him. At first it started this way because his schedule way way worse than mine, so we could only see each other on his terms. In the beginning, I had a lot other things going for me: my career, my hobbies, my friends etc. There were times I sad no to meeting up simply because I had already made other plans. But gradually, in part also because of Covid-induced restrictions, he became the main source of excitement in my life.

Anytime he texted me, my heart leaped. When we met, it was always the most exciting day of my week. With the other friends I mainly just talked on the phone and maybe visited once per month, with him we saw each other every week, sometimes more than once. In the last couple of months of our relationship, that was even more prominent. I used to go out pretty often but now I wasn't going because parties were forbidden due to Covid. I used to partake in group hobbies, but I found myself ditching them in order to meet up with him - many times already in advance, ie. I didn't even sign up for some weekly classes in the evening because I wanted to have my schedule clear *in case* he wanted/could meet up. I feel bad writing this, but more than once I ditched my friends (decade-long friendships!) in favour of meeting up with him instead. I even adapted my working from home schedule based on when we could meet! My whole routine, my whole mind really, revolved around him. I never wanted to say no to him, because I feared we wouldn't have a chance to meet otherwise.

Why is this a problem? Because I probably expected the same from him, but of course that didn't happen - it's not a healthy attitude to have! Because when I was bored when I had nothing going on besides the possibility of meeting up with him, I reacted badly if he said he couldn't meet. Because I overanalyzed and ruminated about every single sentence he wrote, which I probably wouldn't do if I hadn't had so much free time on my hands. Same for getting anxious when he didn't reply for hours. Because with time I didn't have *any* boundaries with him anymore. Because when he pulled away slightly, I didn't have it in me to give him space, instead got clingy and demanding. Because when he broke up with me, I couldn't imagine my everyday life without him in it - because I'd gotten so used to planning it around him that I had been doing it automatically.

I'm not saying I'm all to blame that things didn't work anymore between us. I'm not. I know a lot of it has to do with him, with his poor communication and with him not prioritizing me anymore. I know my needs matter, too. However, on my end I could have handled things in a better way if my life/routine/mood hadn't depended so heavily on him. He didn't ask me to make all my decisions based on him, that's totally on me.

It's probably never a good idea to make someone the center of your universe. But that's even more important f you have anxious attachment style (and even more so if it's a casual relationship!). There will be much less anxiety in your life/relationship if you have other things to do, other things to look forward to, other sources of excitement. You will ruminate less. You won't be so inclined to catastrophic thinking, because regardless of what happens, it *won't* be a catastrophe - your partner will be just a *part* of your life.

I just hope I've learned from this hearbreak and that no matter how much I like someone (provided that there'll be someone else at some point, of course) I won't ever do this again. And if someone is not giving me enough, I hope I have the strength to walk away from the situation sooner. The center of my universe should be ME. A partner can just add to that - and if he no longer does, I should be able to let go of him. And also, I definitely need more friends, lol.",r8s3ol,102,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/r8s3ol/tip_1_dont_make_them_the_center_of_your_universe/,AnxiousAttachment,1

I'm tired of this. It feels like a constant kick in my progress. I was doing so well. And now he's gone cold on me.

I'm sick of it. I'm so tired. And I promised myself that the next time this happens, I will leave him. I'm going to leave him. i have to. For the sake of my mental health.

195,What do you do to manage your anxiety and control yourself from messaging/calling when your partner has asked for space?,"My partner asks for space sometimes to process or to have a break from conflict. We are constantly running into the trap of that making my anxiety go wild and I start calling, messaging, saying I can't do this and we need to resolve things right away. He then feels more overwhelmed and wants more space and then lashes out when he feels trapped into not being able to space or risk the relationship. Our relationship has become extremely unhealthy and we are hurting each other a lot.

The thing is, I logically know that pursuing him in this state makes everything worse. It hurts him and me, and I want to give him the space he needs, but I just can't get a grip on the anxiety. What do you do to stop incessantly ruminating, calling, messaging, and just generally being in a state of severe angst while your partner needs space. I'm so tired of my state of calm depending on contact with my partner and I want desperately to stop feeling that way. I want to be able to just live my life and have a good time even when he needs space without constantly pining away for when my partner re-establishes contact and we make up.",15szblq,101,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/15szblq/what_do_you_do_to_manage_your_anxiety_and_control/,AnxiousAttachment,1

199,I’m currently experiencing a spiral and this is how I’m self soothing,"32f

Thank you guys for being in this community. It gives me a safe space to type some shit out and get control of my fight or flight response. 

Freshly dating 36m (1 month). It’s going well and I’m scared. The intrusive thoughts are picking up on every little thing right now.  It’s a slow build from noticing strange phone behaviours last weekend when he was over. 

After posting here, I got some good advice and since he’s been staying over twice a week at this point, leaving sleep stuff and a toothbrush here, the fast pace made me anxious about his intentions so I felt comfortable enough to say, “hey I know it’s early, but I feel that I want to put chatting anyone else up on hold while I get to know you better. How do you feel about that?” He said he felt the same way and that leaving his stuff here was his way of telling me that. I felt great and ready to be a little more vulnerable with this person. 

He’s been very consistent, he’s been communicative.. and here I am sitting in a panic because I see his snap location is somewhere else that isn’t home. 

Intrusive thoughts:
- he didn’t mention seeing friends or doing anything tonight 
- he said he picked up a shift at work tomorrow, that’s weird 
- he must be at another girls house 
- text him and ask what he’s up to
- see if he replies and how he replies
- he’s going to lie and tell me he fell asleep and I’m going to have to admit that I saw his snap location and knows that he’s lying 

Self soothing thoughts
- you’ve been dating for a month. He doesn’t have to report his plans or whereabouts to you 
- he’s likely at a friends house, it’s friday
- you’ve been wrong about this in past relationships and have wasted a lot of time, cancelled plans and let this affect you all for nothing 
- this is your fear of abandonment acting up
- if he is a sketchbag, at least you’d know 
- you’re seeing all his good sides because this is new. Losing him should not feel this threatening yet, you don’t truly know him 
- you’ve moved on from situations like this several times. You’ll be ok. You’ll be better than ok 
- if he’s meant for you, you’ll hear from him tonight and he will be honest 




So much of my worth goes into someone liking me enough. I know at the end of the day if he’s the right guy then those anxious thoughts will be proven wrong, and if they aren’t it’s more about me leaving a situation that isn’t right for me. He may have been genuine in saying he feels the same way, he may have not. Either way, this impending doom I’m afraid of, it’s not going to be as bad as I think it’ll be. It’s a pain I can get past and will be happy on my own. I’ve BEEN happy on my own. 

Thanks if you’ve made it this far… I’m not cold and shaking anymore. My heart rates slowed down.


*Edit 10 minutes after I posted this: he texted me. He told me where he was, what he’s up to, he’s hanging with some work friends.

200,I just broke up with someone I believe is an avoidant and I feel so good to be by myself (even in this pandemic),"I’ve been going to therapy for almost a year now. My therapist suggested me to read “attached” by Amir Levine last month and suggested that I share it with my then boyfriend, too. At the time of that therapy session, I’d already started describing the relationship as a rollercoaster ride to my friends. Because he’d say things that were really sweet and show that he wanted affection but this would never last. His demeanour would change quickly after we spend some time together to shutting down on me and only replying in short responses.

The week prior to the breakup, he said to me that he’s never had a girlfriend this caring before and he promised he’d always hold my heart. The following week he went radio silent on me all the sudden. I was emotionally drained at this point after communicating with him so many times. It was difficult and sad but I decided to give up trying to salvage this relationship. Eventually, we arrived at the same conclusion, which I think is the best possible outcome. 

With this pandemic I’m isolated by myself all the time now but I go for a long walk, eat healthy, and try to meditate everyday. I also video chat with my friends regularly on the weekends. My takeaway is that, yes, it’s hard and sometimes lonely by yourself, but it’s really not worth changing another person by sacrificing who you are. If you haven’t already, please read the book I mentioned. I finished it after the breakup but every case they mentioned in the book, I can relate to. It was so triggering but also empowering to know that i made the right decision. Taking care of yourself should always be the top priority.",ga62df,104,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ga62df/i_just_broke_up_with_someone_i_believe_is_an/,AnxiousAttachment,1

202,"""you're not addicted to the person, you're addicted to the pattern"" (rant)"," I realized don't fear loss, I fear being *triggered* as well. Took me a long time to realize this. I was watching a video (I forgot which one) and the creator mentioned that people are addicted to the pattern of unavailability, not the person themselves. 

This so so true. Each time I finally moved on from someone , I completely forget their existence. I never truly ""loved"" that person (don't get me wrong I did care about them but I think my version of love is heavily skewed) I was trying to solve old patterns through them. 

Every time I'm out of the relationship, the limerence dies within 90 days. I was never genuinely attached to them, just their pattern. I didn't truly fear losing that person, I feared the feeling of being TRIGGERED by the lack of access to them. 

I feared the hot sweats, nausea, intrusive thoughts, loss of appetite, and loss of interest in literally everything except that person. I feared losing control over myself. I fear limerence, not loss. 

I have to remind myself over and over that attachment isn't love (it's a part of it but not all of it) and limerence *especially* isn't love. 

I also have to avoid being a hypocrite. I get mad at avoidants for their emotional detachment when I'm actually detached too. Engaging in fantasies of other people is how I avoid my real emotions. 

Talking with some of my family yesterday, i realized that I can't cry during certain heavy topics. When people express genuine affection towards me, I feel extremely uncomfortable and I want to get away from them. 

Chasing unavailable people is easy, because then I don't have to look at myself and address the fact that I'm terrified of intimacy too. Their flattery gasses my head the sweet ego stroking I want without ever revealing who I am deep down inside. 

I (just like avoidants) can blame the other person. ""If only they did this"", ""if only they were that"" knowing full well they won't do certain things or act a certain way. Its so much easier to say ""you're the problem"" than to look deeply at yourself and address those deep fears of inadequacy and fear of being *seen*. 

This is why I don't get too mad at avoidants when they behave the way they do. APs and avoidants are two sides of the same intimacy fear coin.",120snpa,100,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/120snpa/youre_not_addicted_to_the_person_youre_addicted/,AnxiousAttachment,1
203,A useful tool for improving communication with your partner,"My DA partner and I sometimes struggle with my frequent need for reassurance.

I'm the rabbit, the carrots represent reassurance, and my partner is the chef responsible for picking carrots from the carrot plantation.

Sometimes, I'll express that I'm feeling hungry. If she's stressed, she'll let me know that the chef hasn't found any carrots yet but will be able to visit the carrot plantation within a couple of days.

The baseline daily anxiety wanes with time. A different anxiety replaces it, but it’s prone to waves so you get moments of respite. 

Return to routine:
You get your time back, and your ability to say No back. You get to experience the comfort of not feeling gaslit, jealous or needy at random intervals throughout the day.

The Addiction Fades:
Eventually, you stop checking your phone for their texts. You forget to stalk their instagram.  They start to look like Just Some Person. 

Long live the group chat: 
You become much closer with your friends, calling and texting them whenever you’d previously text Them. Your social life becomes vibrant again, and going out is fun again. 
 
Meeting someone new: 
This time you know a few moves of the dance. You’re conscious of your emotional habits. You make different dating choices. 

You heal.
You choose the stable person who lets you feel totally at peace. You move at a regular pace.

I think I am using self soothing techniques wrong. Instead of actually enjoying them, I do them just as a way to distract from my feelings of abandonment when my girlfriend doesn’t give me adequate attention. How do I start actually enjoying being by myself and stop obsessing about my partner? 

so far the techniques i’ve tried are: 

-putting my phone on do not disturb for long periods of time so that i’m not waiting for the text notification and am able to use my phone
-downloading cbt therapy guides from pinterest for cognitive distortions/journaling
-visiting friends or scheduling time with other people to distract from anxious feelings
-taking up hobbies that don’t require my phone (cross stitching, crocheting, drawing) so i obsess over notifications less
-the newest one i’ve been trying is turning off her message alerts until 5pm every day and not allowing myself to check for her texts until then. 

ultimately i’ve found that while these methods can be an okay distraction, they don’t prevent the resentment building up because i still feel unwanted when my girlfriend doesn’t text me during the day.

I hate it how avoidantly attached people are so much more respected even though they are also full of stress, disconnection and annoying in my opinion.",10qv6fx,96,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10qv6fx/how_not_to_feel_like_crap_about_yourself_when_the/,AnxiousAttachment,1

216,"Asked some direct questions with the girl I was seeing, and walked away when my basic needs weren't met","I met a really cute girl at a social event at a bar just over a month ago. I wasn't even especially looking to date at the time, just having some time off from it all but she made a move on me and made it clear she was very into me. I was really into it, not gonna lie and delighted that something was happening organically instead of on an app.

Anyway as time passed and we went on a couple more dates, it became clear that the same pattern was forming, like me doing 95% of the work, carrying the conversation, getting ignored for days at a time, her doing the bare minimum. I also got Covid and whilst other friends/family checked on me and asked if I needed stuff, she didn't really check in with how I was feeling or offer any help etc. I know it's early days to be giving that kind of support to each other, but showing kindness and compassion is something I look for in a partner as I would do the same for them.

A couple of days ago, after her withdrawal triggered an anxious episode, I just asked straight up if she wanted to continue or not and how she was feeling. Didn't attach any emotion to it, or dump my anxiety on her. Just made it clear that I need direct communication sometimes.

No response for over 24 hours, despite her coming onto WhatsApp a few times throughout the day. Then the usual ""Oh I didn't see your message, I'm so busy sorry, I like you but don't have loads of time to date"". In past situations I've definitely been guilty of leaving this sort of interaction as open-ended, but this time I just clearly stated I needed someone to have a mutual level of interest and energy, and said thanks it was fun but walked away. None of my usual ""I don't mind doing casual"", no ""ok, well let me know if you wanna get in touch again in a few months"", no emotionally fuelled response.

I hope this means I'm starting to lean into my more secure tendencies, because I know I can be secure when my self-esteem is good and I establish boundaries. Currently I'm feeling relief and empowerment whilst trying not to fall into the spiral of ""nobody out there for me"" etc etc. It is tough, especially in the lesbian dating world as dating pools are small, but it was the right decision and I'm pleased with myself.  My biggest downfall is that I do like sex a lot and if somebody attractive wants to have sex or make out with me, it's my biggest weakness. It really feeds my ego when someone attractive is into me, and I know I have to work on that, and trying to form more genuine connections first. I'm a bit intimacy-starved most of the time so sex is a rare luxury... In this case we never slept together which made it easier to walk away but tbh if she had been more forthcoming with that stuff I definitely would have got physically involved with her.

But to others in the same boat, yes you can give things a chance, but you can pull the plug early, you don't have to keep pushing and pulling. It's so empowering to choose to walk away yourself, rather than waiting on them to pull the plug. Make your needs and boundaries clear from the outset, and the rest will follow.",t16d9j,95,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/t16d9j/asked_some_direct_questions_with_the_girl_i_was/,AnxiousAttachment,1
217,Amazing insight into my anxious attachment.,"The past couple of days have been an amazing opportunity for self-reflection. Truly, the universe is giving me a gift. Two weeks ago, I was broken up with. The relationship was something I'd been thinking about ending weeks before. Yet, in the days following, my fear of abandonment was triggered as bad as it has ever been.

A couple days after the break-up, my previous ex (not the one who just broke up with me) reached out to see if I'd like to meet up. She had also dumped me, several months prior, causing the world to come crashing down. I've barely heard from her since. She was asking if I was dating someone and talking about all the fun times we'd had. She didnt say it, but I sense she is thinking about getting back together. Mind you, I went through several weeks of hell after she ended it. 

The thing is, I now have zero attraction to her. None!

I am realizing that my anxious attachment is like my nervous system taking over my body. It isn't even me, it's like an alien takes over when someone rejects me. I have investigated where it comes from in therapy, and I can't point to a single event. My mom says, ""you were always clingy, even as a baby you wanted to be close"". So, perhaps, I've always been this way. I've been reading about ""rejection sensitive dysphoria"". It is thought to be caused by your brain structure and results in very strong emotional reactions to rejection. And, so, I wonder if being anxiously attached is biological and has always been there...... regardless, I attach strongly to partners. This is not a bad thing -- I am giving, safe, protective and focused on my partner. There are many good things about being open-hearted. And, maybe, it's just who I am. Maybe, there is nothing wrong with these feelings.",150wv38,93,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/150wv38/amazing_insight_into_my_anxious_attachment/,AnxiousAttachment,1
218,I think even secure people will get anxious when avoidants go into deactivation,"I’ve been really thinking a lot lately and I think it’s normal to get anxious and hurt when someone you love doesn’t reply or doesn’t follow through with plans. 

I don’t bombard my partner with messages/calls. I give him ample space. But whenever I invite him to go out, he goes MIA. I won’t hear a word from him for days. In this time, I just leave him alone. I don’t text him anymore and just wait for him to come back. 

Honestly, it has become too hurtful and tiring. I hate the words “next time”, “one time”, “next week”, or any vague promise of a future. Because I think I’m just being led on when no actual plans are made. 

This is just a rant. I’m just going through things.

220,My List: How I hacked becoming secure as a former AP,"Hello beautiful people. I wrote this in a comment the other day and a few people were interested so I thought I’d make a post in case others find it helpful too! 

[**Here is My List**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQXbDt3nsd5U2W6oQ7WRDp-7ppsOF_SlNNlsIlKsFnTBv6WUCxIGv1WqV_AvNp58pn3319QpbANY5i7/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)

This is pretty much my blueprint for a relationship. Making it was easier said than done and don’t get me wrong, it took me a while, and it was refined many times. But it’s helped me become so much more secure, I cant recommend it enough! It’s like my safety net. 

I came up with the items on the list by thinking about what went wrong in my past relationships & the lessons i don’t need to learn again. This was a great self-soothing exercise for me because it gave me back some control. I read over it often & remind myself I won’t let my heart get hurt by letting these things get in the way again. Feel free to use mine as a starting point, but definitely have a sit down with yourself for this. This is your contract with yourself to keep your heart safe & it should be tailored to you.

So, here’s a guide to make your own if you’d like to. I hope it’s as helpful to you as it was for me!

ETA: *It’s important to distinguish this list from qualities you’d like in a partner.*

My List has six columns (I’ll break down what they mean in a minute)
1) Dealbreakers*
2) Musts
3) Needs*
4) Desires
5) What I will do
6) What I won’t do

*you can make it easier with just these two if you like.

**Materials**

* Motivation (when I was in peak anxiety mode & I would do anything to make me feel better)
* Relationship inventory
* Whiteboard or a spreadsheet (lots of editing happens)
* Time (you don’t have to do it all at once!)

**Method**

**Step 1:** What I did first was make a relationship inventory and some good old factor analysis! I wrote down everyone I’ve ever been romantically involved with, what I liked about dating them and what went wrong. You could even consider relationships with primary caregivers. 

**Step 2:** I sorted things into categories/columns. I did mine on the floor with a whiteboard, a cup of coffee and lots of colourful pens!

1) Dealbreakers: Things I just absolutely won’t tolerate & will end the relationship over. I tell myself that it’s out of my hands if they break those rules. 
2) Musts: Important things that I need to be understood
3) Needs: The things that keep me from becoming anxious or unhappy (love languages come in here)
4) Desires: Where I’d like the relationship to go in the future. Communicating this early on can prevent unnecessary heartbreaks down the line (marriage, family, living situation, your ideal relationship)

5/6. What I Will/Won’t Do: basically the value I bring to the relationship

I kept it where I could see it for a couple of weeks and refined it whenever I thought of something else. I added things as I went that felt like they were obvious to me but might not be obvious to someone else. 

*It’s important to be incredibly specific with each item, because the more vague the point is the easier it will be to ‘let it slide’ or talk yourself out of once you have your love-glasses on.*

**Step 3:** Once I was happy with my progress, I showed it to my partner as things were becoming more serious (i.e. before committing to a relationship). How someone reacts to the list can be a huge indicator to me of where things are headed. If they really care about me & want to be in my life they won’t be scared off by My List, they’ll be grateful that things are clear cut for them too. If they disrespect it, I have my answer. Showing my partner was surprisingly nerve wracking to do but once I knew he was aware of my rules it was a huge weight lifted. If he breaks them it’s out of my hands. He asked for clarification around some things and in the end we agreed on everything. It went so well, he even asked for a copy so that he can refer to it when he needs to, and he made his own list which i’m very grateful for.

I hope you find this helpful & I’d love to hear your thoughts! Best wishes x",ydkc7f,92,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ydkc7f/my_list_how_i_hacked_becoming_secure_as_a_former/,AnxiousAttachment,1

222,tips to prevent spiraling when texting,"1. after sending a risky text or a text you’re awaiting a reply to, delete the chat. this way you can’t see when they’ve read it and you can’t ruminate over the exact words you said if they don’t answer for a while. and you can’t unsend the message if you start spiraling. You lose chat history but the payoff is so worth it in my opinion. 

2. send statements instead of questions. for example “hey are you available to call right now?” turns into “hey i’d love to talk on the phone if you’re not too busy”. or “hello? are you there?” becomes “let me know when you’re ready”. 
idk about u guys but when a question is ignored it hurts me way way more than when a statement is ignored. one feels like they’re blatantly ignoring me. the other feels moreso like they’re just busy. hard to explain, maybe just me. 

3. have a “no serious talks over text” rule for urself. if it’s serious: calling or face to face convo only. this way you won’t feel anxious waiting around for a reply and they can’t ghost you if they get scared of your emotions. 

4. if you do find urself waiting by the phone for a reply, mute notifications from that person and set a check-in schedule: maybe you manually check their chat twice a day, once at 10am once at 10pm. this way you can go about your day thinking maybe they already responded , and you can function as normally. 

hopefully these make sense and are helpful. these are all rly helpful to me when i’m feeling anxious so thought i’d share.",qh72b5,93,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/qh72b5/tips_to_prevent_spiraling_when_texting/,AnxiousAttachment,1
223,"Write a ""Remember"" list! How I am trying to abstain from going back to an Avoidant partner.","A few months ago I ended a relationship with a partner who is Avoidant and needs to heal from a lot of trauma before he could be ready for a healthy relationship. Two weeks ago we reconnected and it was exciting and romantic for a short time but then I remembered all of the shit that went wrong before as little things kept popping up. So yesterday I wrote a list of everything I SHOULD not forget about what went wrong in the relationship to keep me from repeating the same patterns. I can read this the next time I start to forget what it was like to date him and run the other direction. It's helping me move on.

 I thought I would share this as it might be helpful to any of you who keep going back to the same person and repeating patterns! It was a LONG list but here are some examples that I wrote...

\-Remember that he has been unable to take accountability for his actions.

\-Remember how he swings from being utterly in love with you to not be able to deal with a relationship and shuts down or stonewalls.

\-Remember that you can't save or fix him.

\-Remember that he has been holding onto resentments about you.

\-Remember that he does not know how to work through conflict and will become agitated when you disagree with him or bring up important issues. Remember how you haven't been able to express yourself without fear.

\-Remember that Rome wasn't built in a day and that this person needs more time to heal.

I hope this helps :)

224,it gets better!,"Today has been a truly remarkable day for me. My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly three years, but during a significant portion of our relationship, I struggled with a severe anxious attachment style. This meant I often found myself desperately wanting to fix any issues that arose, not giving her the space she needed and constantly seeking reassurance from her. My behavior was a classic manifestation of an anxious attachment, and I knew that if I didn't address it, it could become unsustainable and overwhelming for her, potentially endangering our relationship.

Recognizing the potential harm my behavior could cause, I made a decision to work on fixing my anxious attachment. One particular source of insecurity for me was when my girlfriend went out with her friend group late at night. In the past, I had a habit of constantly needing updates and wanting her to call me, which invariably led to tension and distance between us by the end of the night.

However, tonight marked a significant turning point. Instead of succumbing to my anxious tendencies, I mustered the courage to tell her to have a great time and to simply text me when she got back so I knew she was safe at home. To my surprise and relief, she not only texted me but also called me on her way home. She happily shared the details of her night and expressed excitement about seeing me tomorrow.

The remarkable thing was that, this time, I felt secure. I didn't experience that sinking feeling in my heart that used to haunt me when fear or anxiety crept in. I realized that it is possible to evolve and transform from an anxious attachment style into a more secure and confident one ESPECIALLY when you find yourself with a secure partner. 

I'm sharing my experience to emphasize that change is achievable. You can become the secure attachment partner you aspire to be. I fully understand how exhausting and painful an anxious attachment style can be, but it's crucial to remember that these behaviors stem from love and a deep desire to connect. Especially when your need for this constantly connection, ends up pushing away your partner. By reading this on this subreddit and considering your own attachment style, you've already taken the crucial first step towards personal growth and a healthier, happier relationship.

225,"Are you really AP if you only start ""activating"" when something is wrong?","I noticed I have no problem giving people their space. I actually prefer to be alone myself. With romantic partners I'll think of them a lot and miss them when they're not around, but I don't bother them. 

I only start acting clingy and protesting when there's a clear shift in their behavior and I can't figure out what's wrong because they won't communicate.

Is that really being AP or is that normal? How do secures deal with that kind of thing? I feel like I've developed a lot of emotional discipline where I can have full blown panic attacks but not act on it (although I'm literally dying on the inside lol).

227,Anxious attachment at its core is about the fear of loss,"I’ve been reflecting a lot on my anxious attachment style and one thing I found very interesting is that a lot of it improved only after my breakup with my long time partner. This sounds counterintuitive.. but I think it’s because I realized that although the loss was painful, I was OK. I had spent so much time & energy trying to prevent that very thing and when it happened, well, I was okay. In fact sometimes I was happy. After that, I found someone much healthier for me. 

With this, I realized that really at the core of anxious attachment is this deep fear of losing the person we love. We desperately cling to them because we don’t want to face the idea that one day they will not love us, that one day they will leave us. But if we think about it, every relationship in our life, our friends, our family, everything is impermanent. Life is unpredictable, and loss happens. Though romantic loss isn’t a death, it can very much feel like one. But grief is a part of life. 
I’m sure you are all aware that one day your family members may die. What do you do in response to this realization? You hold them closer and appreciate each and every moment to the best of your ability. And I think we should take this same approach into our romantic relationships. 

We can never know what the future holds and although someone can reassure you for eternity, everyone and everything is subject to change. But right now, right in this moment, they love you. And that’s all that matters. Because this moment is all that we can be certain of. 
So, I think we should approach our attachment style with the intention of accepting loss, instead of attempting to always reassure ourselves that loss won’t happen. Because it might. What you can learn to trust though is that you will be OK if it happens. That you are lovable and capable of being truly loved over and over again in life. It takes courage to love, it takes courage to grieve, and that’s a very lovely thing.",ymom1r,92,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ymom1r/anxious_attachment_at_its_core_is_about_the_fear/,AnxiousAttachment,1

229,a reason I'll never look back :),"I've thought a lot about my past relationship with an avoidant. I reflected on the good and bad and everything in between. I came to the realisation that I didn't get much from him. And I say this with no judgement at all. There really wasn't much I was getting from him as a boyfriend. Of course when we were together it was nice sometimes. And we had good chemistry sexually. That's part of what kept me there for so long. But I realise I couldn't trust him to be there for me when I really needed him. Things were always too much for him and there was always so much he put on his plate. I empathised with that the best I could but eventually it became very one sided. And I ended up an anxious mess who has to play catch up with her life. 🙃

231,How can I stop being insecure about my partner finding other people attractive?,"Hey all! I'm looking for some no-judgement, compassionate, supportive advice here. I've struggled with this in almost every relationship I've ever been in 🥺

For some reason, the idea of my partner finding other people attractive absolutely drives me crazy. I know my boyfriend loves me, is choosing me, and isn't going to cheat on me. But I just get so stressed thinking about him finding other girls attractive.

He doesn't even tell me he does, so it's not like he's the trigger for this. I have a few times gone into my desperate question-asking mode where I'll ask him and he'll tell me ""yes, I think other people are good-looking, but it doesn't mean I'm thinking about them or want them"". 

But I just start overthinking when I see him talking to girls, see girls he follows on social media, etc. etc.. My brain goes insane, and I genuinely can't stop thinking about it and getting upset about it. I start to feel so bad about myself, and like I'm not good enough.

I feel like when I'm single, I do SO well with loving myself and accepting the way I look.

But as soon as I'm in a relationship, my mind leaps to thoughts of ""he must be checking them out. he must be thinking about them. he must be comparing me to them."" and I gradually lose all my confidence and self-love.

Another thing: It's so frustrating because I know that \*I\* find other men good-looking, but I know that's not a threat to my relationship and that my boyfriend has nothing to worry about. But I for some reason can't reverse that logic. 

Please try to not be too judgemental of me, I'm after some compassionate support, I know this isn't a healthy mindset and I want to work on it. Any advice please?

233,"In case you need to hear a ""success"" story","I've been seeing someone now for 7 months and until recently my anxiety was through the roof. At the time I had only heard bad stories about AAs and DAs/FAs in relationships so I wanted to talk about how we've managed in our relationship in case anyone needs to hear it right now to give them hope.

My current partner is 30M and leans DA. He hasn't been in a long term relationship before because he's generally been afraid of getting too emotionally close to someone and then getting hurt and highly values his ""alone time"". At first I wasn't sure I would be able to handle this. I decided to be honest with him one day and tell him that I have an anxious attachment style and while I want to respect his need for space, I also need some reassurance every once in a while. Rather than criticize him, I focused on examples of times when he did a great job at making me feel reassured which helped avoid potentially triggering the ""I cant do anything right so might as well not try"" deactivation strategy DAs often have. He was really receptive to it and we talked about ways he can provide this without feeling like his need for space is being violated. 

Now we have a pretty good system going where if he needs alone time he'll send me a text saying something like ""it's an introvert kind of day, but I still love you!"" And I won't feel the need to call and text a million times.

235,I may have found the biggest trigger and cure for AP.,"So I've been trying healing my attachment issues for about 4 years now. Believe me when I say it is a struggle some days especially when encountering a new relationship. 

I feel like I'm pretty secure(ish) at this point but I would still often get major episodes of anxiety, spirals, over thinking, clingy. So what I tried to do is find a common ""factor"" in all my episodes. What I found was of all the times I've had major episodes there would be a recurring behavior I was doing.

Lying. I would lie to the people I was interested in, I would even lie to myself. Mostly because I am very lonely. I would tell people that I was Ok with their avoidant behavior. Or that I was Ok with keeping it casual when in my heart I know I want a stable healthy monogamous relationship. I would lie about who I was and make up stories to impress people I liked in the hopes they would like me. I am introverted so I would lie to myself and force myself to go out and do things I didn't want to. 

So recently I've started telling the absolute truth at all times. No over blown stories, no exaggerations, tell everyone the truth. If I was anxious in a moment or uncomfortable with something or someone I would just flat out say it. And I've felt a lot more secure in who I was and felt alot better.

Now I don't mean use truth to hurt people. I'll never be that blunt asshole, if I think saying something might hurt someone I don't say it.

236,Aware that you're AP? Here's what you can do.,"I just wanted to share a rough guide from my own experience about dealing with anxious attachment and managing the symptoms. A lot of people who have been using this subreddit are aware of their attachment, but don't really know where to go from there. Awareness alone is a fantastic first step, but it's not enough to help you lessen the effects and improve out of your situation. A lot of people also seem to get really discouraged that they're doing the work to try and become more secure, but can't figure out why anxious flare ups are still happening. 

Dealing with this style takes a multi-faceted approach and has to be tackled from many angles. Here are some suggestions. 

**1) Research your attachment:** This is where most people are already, but it's an important enough step to start with. Delve into as many sources you can. The book *Attached*,  the youtube series Personal Development School by Thais Gibson, and the book *Journey from Abandonment to Healing* were all sources that helped me get an understanding of my attachment style from a very basic level. 

**2) Identify your wounds:** Once you've learned a bit more about attachment theory in general, you'll see a lot of advice centered around core wounds. Thais Gibson has a great outline on these. For anxious attachers like ourselves, the core wound of not being good enough is a big one. A lot of anxious attachers suffer from deeply low esteem. Because of this, many of us are deeply dependent on the validation from others to feel good. This process would be greatly aided by the help of therapy. During therapy I was able to go back into my childhood and trace the source of my poor self-esteem to my experience with school peers and academics. 

I also discovered that a lot of my self-esteem issues manifest in my adulthood due to not feeling accomplished in my career, not feeling I have hobbies and interests enough to keep occupied or fulfilled, feeling like a failure at everything I do. I ended up discovering with my therapist that these issues come from crippling insecurities about my intelligence and capabilities, and that in fact dating and relationships have been used as a coping strategy to escape from those fears. 

**3) Target your wounds:** Working with a therapist can be instrumental for this process if you are able to access one. I did a lot of inner child work to address my child-self's feelings of not being pretty enough, smart enough etc. This also helped me change the language and tone I used to speak with myself from being punitive to being loving and forgiving. Self love is an important part of the healing process. I did some gratitude journaling in which I started to take better stock of the things that I did have going for me which were positive. 

It's important to me that I feel like a capable adult who is financially independent, and not feeling that way had led me to feel vulnerable and fearful. Now I am doing my best to work on career and self, and do more ""adulting"" things so that I feel secure in knowing I can take care of myself. I also dove into to a ton of hobbies, both old and new and made some strides in those. The goal is to have enough sources of validation from my own reservoirs of self esteem, so that I don't have to depend on others.

**4) Anxiety management:** THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. A ton of people here beat themselves up so much because they aren't responding to anxious triggers differently than they had before. Doing the long term work is an important part of the journey toward being secure, but they WILL NOT fix anxious spiraling. In order to fix anxious spiraling, the best information I have come across that has actually worked is through this series [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTuX_ShUrw0)

You can not think you're way out of an anxious spiral. You can not just try and tell yourself to feel differently and expect it work. When you're activated you're brain is in flight or fight mode. You're entire physiology is responding to a perceived threat; in our case it's often the fear of abandonment. You don't have access to your rationality, so don't beat yourself up if you're not able to stay rational. 

You have to stay with your anxious feelings in a mindful way. That means be aware of and note the unpleasant sensations without resorting to ruminating, overthinking etc. If you've ever practiced mindfulness, this is the mental state you're supposed to get into. I usually tell myself, ""okay my chest is tight, my heart is beating fast, I'm breathing really hard. These are all just sensations of my body.""  You're mind is trained to think that ruminating is a helpful strategy as a response to the trigger.  It will feel unpleasant, but using this method is best way to ensure that your brain slowly starts lessening the response associated with that trigger.

However, the goal is to rewire your brain to realise that you are actual not in danger and not in threat. I would highly recommend the series that I linked to learn more about how to do this. 

&#x200B;

So I hope this advice is helpful to someone. Especially part 4. It's great that we are aware of our attachment styles but there is just so much more that goes into it when it comes to actually working ourselves to secure.",ofua1m,89,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ofua1m/aware_that_youre_ap_heres_what_you_can_do/,AnxiousAttachment,1
237,Anyone else find that distractions don't really help or is it just me?,"My partner and I are currently long distance and my anxious attachment is killing me. Over-analyzing every text, feeling insecure when they goes to a club with friends etc. I just can't take it any more. 

I've been trying to distract myself and be in the moment with my family (who I'm visiting after a year) but nothing seems to be helping. I'm literally on a vacation with my folks and I can't be present with them because I'm constantly thinking of my partner and suffering from separation anxiety. It makes me embarrassed and guilty. Most of all, it makes me feel defeated because I'm realizing even distractions don't help and that sucks. If I can't distract myself in this situation, maybe I never will be able to. I've tried various activities over the past few months and just can't help but ruminate. Is it time to throw in the white flag? Has anyone called it and been happier after?

238,"Embrace the Process of Going No Contact till it No Longer Becomes ""No Contact"" and instead You Just Living Your Life, Moving On & Knowing You Deserve Better...","I wrote this journal entry a while back when processing a breakup. I hope it gives you some solace and clarity. The below may or may not fully resonate with you but it is a personal account of my own realisations. If you want to delve deeper in your process, please check out the website link in my bio for 1-1 support. 

~ ~ ~

Why have I kept contacting him/wanting to still *“hang out”* after he left me, broke my heart and been repeatedly rejecting me? Why? What’s driving that behaviour? 

A struggle to fully let go? Do I want him to never forget me? Us? To prove to myself that he can’t be  *""that bad”* or  *“that evil”?* Maybe he can show me those sweeter, sensitive sides to him that I initially experienced if I stick around long enough/ *”wait it out”?*

Maybe if he’s around me long enough he can realise what a foolish mistake he’s made and value me again? Learn to love me again better this time? Maybe I will get the loving side again and prove to my parents, bullies and all the old conditioning that - 

*“See! I told you guys I’m worthy! I mean, I’ll prove you all wrong! I **am** loveable! People **can** be with me and **love** being with me! People can and do want me! So fxck you all!”*

… but this is a wounded, traumatised, hurt part of myself that has been taught she is not enough, loveable or worth being with and if she can get an emotionally unavailable person’s attention then she can prove herself, her worth, value and lovability, that she’s enough?

And that’s deeply sad because she thinks she can only do this by getting someone who has left her, broken her heart and mistreated her to change their minds (& heart) and accept her again. If he could just accept and want her again - she will be okay, enough, worthy, lovable…

If she can just get his attention, energy, love and validation again then she can prove her parents & those bullies all wrong! If she can  *""get”* or have someone want her again, if she can *“belong”* in another’s life and heart who mistreated and rejected her - that she will be whole, complete and just o-k!

…Well this is faulty programming as the focus is on the external and not the internal. All that is sought and wanted externally has to be given internally from within **AND** from **other** available sources - **NOT** this person, **NOT** your ex - where the dynamic reminds her of an old feeling she endured as a child; with her parents, in school, in the playground. She’s still in an old, self-abandoning pattern when she lets the irrational tug consume and defeat her by focusing on someone who is not deserving of her.

The old feelings of longing, aching, emptiness, despair, loneliness, sadness, frustration, anxiety and being *“in limbo”* waiting, feeling not seen, heard, accepted, misunderstood, not loved or valued, not safe, like she’s not enough, that something is *“wrong”* with her - how she used to be scapegoated as a child, like an outsider not worthy of belonging anywhere - not within her own family, school or in the world. Just an alien destined for repeated rejection and abandonment. 

…

Well… being in this pattern perpetuates the old cycle of pain, trauma and abandonment.

You abandon yourself when you give your energy to those who abandon you. 

How will it affect your sense of self-love, self-esteem, self-worth and confidence by returning to someone who rejected you? Who hurt you? You’re opening up the wound over and over again.

It does not align with how you truly want to feel about yourself.

How do **you** / How do **I** want to feel about myself?

Like I’m **ENOUGH**, accepted, valued, worthy, beautiful, resilient, strong, at ease, at peace, deserving of the best life has to offer. I want to feel secure, self-assured, abundant, free, light, empowered, self-contained, fulfilled, whole, complete, grounded, present, rooted, influential, connected.

Going to the source of your pain (i.e. your ex) brings you more pain and takes you out of allignment.

Putting self-respect in practice is ceasing all contact with an ex who betrayed you. It is not giving your energy to places where it is not appreciated, valued or even accepted and wanted let alone reciprocated.
Self-respect is valuing your energy, attention, time, resources, yourself, your body and your heart.
It is not wanting someone who does not want you or waiting for them to want you again(!) 
It is not longing and living in stagnation. 
It is not losing yourself in a relationship.

It is honouring yourself fully even if your emotions are really strong sometimes. It is resisting the tug, the pull and urge and being grounded as you navigate certain experiences in life and look at the bigger picture holistically. It is being connected to your essence, to your wise self. How would you want the *“ideal”* version of yourself to act?

She would cease all contact. She would keep building herself and her life up.
She would give energy towards those who welcome it, want it, appreciate and value it. Who would reciprocate it.
She values her time and energy. She cares about herself, her present and her future.
She does things for herself not for the validation of others.
She lives her life and expresses herself for herself - without attachment to any particular outcome from anyone or anything. She trusts her own wisdom. ",wg1s4i,88,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/wg1s4i/embrace_the_process_of_going_no_contact_till_it/,AnxiousAttachment,1
239,Learning how to slow down and embracing the moment when building a relationship,"Something that I've struggled with is knowing how to tolerate uncertainty while dating. Until recently, I never made the connection that it was connected to my AP attachment. So what would happen is I would attempt to self-soothe by seeking reassurance from the person I was dating. Or worse, I couldn't tolerate letting a relationship build over time nor was I able to give the other person the chance to process their emotions as we would get to know each other. I would rationalize that everything had to move quickly! This latter part was also a new revelation to me that I had never connected to my attachment style. It was a pattern that I was unaware of and I would repeatedly sabotage myself even when people initiated interest with me.  I recently wrote a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/15ey4ko/ap_struggling_with_uncertainty_and_selfsabotage/) about my struggles with the uncertainty aspect during the dating phase.

The other day I just happened to read really great post from another user with AP who has learned how to cope with uncertainty and how AP can lead to us not being able to tolerate the building aspect of beginning a relationship. It was so insightful to me that I wanted to put it into practice. I went out recently with someone who I'm still seeing and this time I went out with the intention to just enjoy the moment and not worry about future outcomes. I found myself being able to show more of my true self and this person told me that she enjoyed the time we spent together. Since then, I haven't been focusing on constant contact. We want to see each other again and we also have our own lives that we are living so I'm not finding myself worrying about trying to call or text this person to ""maintain"" a connection. We communicate of course, but it's not all day thing or daily. What's been communicated between the both of us is enough and we are still in those early stages so it's not even essential or makes much sense. We're both looking forward to what comes next. As for me. I'm looking forward to continuing to grow and shift my mindset. 

u/Astrnougat gave me permission to share her [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/15rveo0/how_to_handle_texting_as_an_anxious_woman_in/jwb3sn4/). I'm also going to quote it below. I hope others find it useful too. Thank you Astrnougat!

> I am anxious too - and first off, realize that your uncomfortable-ness with texting has everything to do with one major factor within you: inability to tolerate uncertainty.

> Probably because your parents weren’t stable with how they connected with you, giving you enough affection to know that it felt good but unable to sustain it for whatever reason so you felt starved of it for periods of time. As a little kid, the uncertainty of their presence is intolerable because you need to feel connected with your caregiver to literally survive. This was a life and death situation for you then

> So yeah - it makes sense why you feel terrified with uncertainty now. But it’s NOT a life or death situation now. And it’s on you to learn how to deal with this uncertainty.

> Here’s what I did while dating my bf and what I still do today to deal with the times he isn’t as text-y.

> First of all: it takes 3-4 months to really know someone. So they really shouldn’t be a part of your daily life for at least that long.

> Second: adjust your expectations. For me I had a list. My ultimate goal is daily contact and check ins with a nightly phone call before bed on the days we are apart. Several hour breaks in texting is normal as long as we touch base in the am and again later. I want someone who also wants this. Then I had to think: how long should it be before I expect this? That is some long-term committed relationship shit. We are neither long-term nor committed. So I should be patient and allow that to GROW NATURALLY.

> How long does it take to grow? Dates 1-5: I would only expect texting every few days before dates to set up and maybe to see how they’re doing, ask about a thing we talked about, send something that made me think about them. Honestly daily texts at this stage is a little too clingy Dates 6-10: getting more serious. We should probably be talking every other day or every day, but I still definitely don’t expect a phone call or a daily check-in or good morning. More like, we just naturally have more to talk about Dates 12+: I would assume at this point we are committed and serious, and should talk every single day. Maybe wish each other good morning. We are becoming a part of each others lives and seeing how we fit with each other now. 3-4 months: new relationship. Saying I love you’s, now you can start to bring up: hey I like to say good morning and goodnight every night we are not together. Now you can establish a nightly phone call routine. Now you can check in daily, ask about work, settle into a real relationship. 4 mos +: your texting should be deeply established by now and will actually probably start to drop off at this point because you are used to each other and what was happening at the beginning was probably pretty unsustainable.

> Step 3: tolerate uncertainty. As outlined above, there is a loooooonnnngggg period of time while dating that you don’t actually know if they are good for you or if they are a good fit. Most people are still deciding after a year! That’s fine and normal. You need to see people in many situations before you truly know them. You NEED to be able to tolerate uncertainty so you can take the time and have a stable enough head to not jump into commitment with the wrong person.

> NOTICE what’s happening: they haven’t texted in 5 hours. You’re starting to wonder why. Your anxiety is rising. What is happening in your body? What are the physiological symptoms of this anxiety? Racing heart? Fast breathing? Tingling hands? Racing thoughts? Deep breathing and meditation. Watch the agitation. Does it die down after a while?

> Time limit: give yourself a time limit. It’s been 4 dates. My expectations are that we don’t text daily. If I don’t hear from them by the day before our next date, I will be worried

> Accept reality: you are anxious because you LIKE this person! How lucky to have met someone you like! You appreciate them, you enjoy getting to know them, they make you feel positively, it makes sense that you don’t want to lose that. If they make YOU feel that way, most likely you make them feel that way. Don’t focus on the anxiety, focus on the excitement! Anxiety is a type of excitement after all. Take your time to get to know them, you can handle the excitement, you’re a grown ass lady.

> Socratic questions: so you’re activated. What thoughts does this bring up for you? What assumptions are you making from not hearing from them? What do you think it means? What are possible OTHER reasons why they might not be texting you that are benign? What is the most likely reason? What is the worst case scenario? What is the most likely scenario?

> This is a great opportunity to learn how to tolerate uncertainty. So use it while you got it!

> Edit: wow it seems this was super helpful for people! I highly recommend CBT therapy, absolutely lifechanging for me.

> I have a page in my phone journal just called THOUGHT LOG. It’s a list of questions to ask myself and to work through whenever I’m in an activated state. I just copy and paste it all and put it on a new entry and start from scratch with each troubling thought. Usually with enough time I will find that there is a “broken belief” in there that is causing most of the distress. Something like: “if they loved me, they would text me”. If you believe that thought, it’ll really get in your way.

> A core mode of some therapies is separating out your adult self and your child self, and asking that scared little kid a bunch of questions like a loving parent would, and guiding them to healthier thinking. After a while with my thought logs, I actually just have an out loud conversation with myself instead of writing things out, it’s faster.

> Also look up DBT worksheets on “distress tolerance”.

> It’s a two-fold issue of having “broken beliefs” which are causing your thoughts to be painful and difficult, and also not being able to tolerate the distress of those thoughts, so you act quickly to alleviate them and you end up making bad decisions. If you can tolerate the distress, you will have the time to work through to the broken thoughts. It’s about slowly replacing the broken ones (which are deeply ingrained) over time.

> It’s like playing an instrument. The more you repeat and repeat and keep teaching yourself that a thought is incorrect, the faster it will be replaced with healthy ones over time!",15vxslr,87,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/15vxslr/learning_how_to_slow_down_and_embracing_the/,AnxiousAttachment,1

245,reminder: anxious attachment isn’t about neediness,"anxiously attached people have the same amount of needs as anyone else. even avoidant people deep down have a lot of needs in a relationship. for us anxious types, the problem is not our needs, but the unhealthy and unproductive ways that we express those needs. depression, anger, and protest behaviors are counterproductive because they don’t actually result in our attachment needs being met, they just end up hurting us and pushing others away.

so don’t beat yourself up for being ‘needy’, or try to hide the fact that you have needs from your partners. you’re never going to be able to get rid of your needs and trying to will just end up with you imploding. instead, work on finding functional ways to communicate those needs that don’t do harm to the self or overwhelm the people in your life. 

if you feel like your partner is not showing you the love you need, entertaining self-hating thoughts, making demands to them, or lashing out at them in anger will not change that. being open with them and suggesting compromises that work for you both, talking to your therapist, or spending more time with loving friends and family are much more functional options to get what you need.

248,"I feel like most of the posts I see here, the OP isn’t always the problem, but their SO is.","I’ve been seeing a lot of posts of people struggling with their anxiety and not feeling securely attached. It takes two to tango. It seems like a lot of the posters are with avoidant partners or just partners who aren’t willing or aware enough to form a relationship with a secure attachment. Both partners have to be self aware and on board.

I am currently dating someone for the first time who seems self aware and emotionally healthy enough to be consistent and form a secure attachment with me. The first two months of dating I was being overly anxious which I kept a lid on, and talked through it in therapy. But now I’m not feeling all that anxious, because of his consistency.

And I mean, maybe a lot of anxiously attached folks here really do have a problem with wanting too much time, badgering, asking for too much, being needy, being overly worried. 

But a lot of people here aren’t JUST anxiously attached. It’s exacerbated by the partners you are with. If you are with an avoidant partner or even just a neglectful or not so great partner. Take the time to find someone who will not neglect you.

Because if my new relationship wasn’t turning out to be A1 with the attachment, honestly I would rather be alone.

> ""To demonstrate how sensitive the attachment system of people with an anxious attachment style is, a study from Chris Fraley’s lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign—he is the same researcher who designed the ECR-R attachment styles inventory—in collaboration with Paula Niedenthal from Blaise Pascal University in Clermont-Ferrand, France, found a unique way of measuring the vigilance to social cues of the anxious attachment style. They used a “morph movie” technique—a computerized movie in which a face initially displays a specific emotional expression (e.g., anger) and gradually evolves into one displaying a neutral expression. [...] The study showed that people with an anxious attachment style tend to jump to conclusions very quickly, and when they do, they tend to misinterpret people’s emotional state. Only when the experiment was designed in such a way that anxious participants had to wait a little longer—they couldn’t react immediately when they spotted a change, but had to wait a little longer—and get more information before making a judgment did they have an advantage over other participants. **This is an important lesson for someone with an anxious attachment style: If you just wait a little longer before reacting and jumping to conclusions, you will have an uncanny ability to decipher the world around you and use it to your advantage.**""

250,Relax: love makes no sense.,"Sometimes healing comes suddenly! I lived in an unhappy relationship for 20 years. Without knowing anything better, I allowed the push-pull dynamic of anxious (me) and avoidant (my ex) attachment to lead into toxicity, infidelity and abuse. 

Since the breakup of that relationship, I've dated a couple of folks: each for several months. They broke up with me: I cried and felt bad about myself.

Throughout the last few years, I've peeled back the onion layers through therapy. During my last breakup, everything felt wrong....why was I so upset about something over which I have no control? They broke up with me, I did nothing wrong. And, finally, through therapy I realized that my happiness doesn't (and shouldn't) depend on others. I am at peace, in a casual but monogamous relationship with someone who dumped me and triggered my anxiety.......but, I just love them, however imperfect they are. I like who they are, I want to spend time with them....but, I don't need them. Supringsly, in reflecting on this journey, I feel whole, I feel at peace. I am lucky to spend time with someone who's essence I cherish.

251,Secure Attachment - What is it?,"I think many people mistakenly think secure attachment is some magical fix all. It gets built up in people's minds and put on some “perfect” pedestal. And in reality securely attached people are not perfect. They too can end up falling for toxic people or ending up in abusive relationships. Hence the possibility of peoples attachment going from secure to insecure. It doesn’t ONLY happen in childhood, insecurity can also appear later in life due to traumatic relationships. 

The only real difference I have seen is that much of the time those that are more secure have better sense of self worth and self esteem and tend to be their more authentic selves. Not because they are perfect and have no flaws or never made mistakes or never experienced a rough time, but because they don’t let that define who they are. Therefore they don’t feel the need to hide that part of them. Though it's not impossible for them to lose sight of this too, from time to time. After all, we are all human. 

Personally I think that being secure is not something that someone would effortlessly be their whole life. Even for people who were raised with secure attachment, it doesn’t mean that as adults they don’t have to work to stay that way. Like everyone else, they need to learn and grow as people too. Life is hard and with attachment being fluid it means even those who are raised as secure, can go in and out of insecurity as well. And in their insecure times whether they lean toward the avoidant or anxious spectrum can be guided based on one’s personality more than anything. 

So I believe that the concept of secure attachment or being secure, means working to have and maintain healthy views of oneself and employing useful coping mechanisms during tough times. However, it is not perfect, or infallible. It is a continuing process. Regardless of attachment as a child, as adults, it takes work to maintain it and is a part of how we grow as people. By looking at it this way, I think it gives me a healthier view and expectation of others, and even myself. 

What do you consider secure attachment to be? How does it affect how you see other people and even yourself?",14f76uf,83,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/14f76uf/secure_attachment_what_is_it/,AnxiousAttachment,1
252,The importance of feeling safe,"One of the things that helps children develop secure attachment is the feeling of being safe. And not just physically safe (like being protected or living in a safe environment) but also emotionally safe. When these are threatened or inconsistent it can and does lead to a range of insecure attachment styles. 

I have found in my healing journey how important it is for me to feel this sense of safety. And while I need to have this with a partner for sure, I also need to feel this within myself. As in feel safe with myself. To know I can advocate for and protect myself (to the best of my abilities). To feel emotionally safe with myself, I have to be aware of my self-talk and not let the inner critic/judge take over. Treat myself with the same kind of love and support that makes me feel safe with a partner. 

How has the need to feel safe shown up for you in your experiences? And what ways have you found effective to find safety within yourself?",13qmlx2,83,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/13qmlx2/the_importance_of_feeling_safe/,AnxiousAttachment,1
253,STOP. TALKING. TO. YOUR. EXES.,"The amount of times people reach back out to their exes, or try to continue being friends w them, or the ex reaches out and they respond or wanna “catch up because they got along well before” is ridiculoussss. 95% of said exes are avoidants. We know BETTER than this! We ARE better than this!! I don’t care if you liked being in their company and wanna be friends, that’s an excuse because there are billions of other friends you could have. It never turns out well. Never. I promise you are not the exception. You’re just gonna get hurt again. We know of all people we are going to be attached and it’s going to hurt like hell. I swear, the second time you end things hurts worst than the first. It causes you a ton of damage the more time you’re spending on these people. Please just stop lying to yourself and treat yourself with respect for once. Let them go, do whatever you have to do to stop talking to your exes.

254,AVOIDANT SUB IS SCARY AF (RANT),"Just venting.

I know that everyone comes from a place of trauma, I try to always be sympathetic towards any non-secure attachment styles and issues.

But I am very freaking surprised to see the avoidant sub full of posts of relationships that are almost ""perfect"" in every way, but the OP wants to end it over very strange and mundane things.  


For example:  


1. Everything is perfect, the partner is very understanding, but he/she is very ""direct"". So op is thinking of ending it. 
2. Everything is perfect, the partner is a very good match, but his family politics (yes, the freaking family politics) don't align with OP. So OP is thinking of ending it.
3. Everything is perfect, the partner is a very understanding person. But OP is thinking of ending it.

I know this is my personal perspective, and everyone has their reasons and is free to do whatever, but is freaking scary to see the reasons for the avoidant to end a good relationship, specially when they recognize that the partner is almost perfect for them in every other way.

I see a lot of positive response from other avoidants on the comments, but a lot of them reinforce the mundane/not important reasons to end a relationship.

255,My mood during my last relationship vs when it was ending vs one month later,"I’ve posted about my recent break up on this thread a couple times. The relationship had been rocky for some time, but I was too scared to leave because I thought the pain would be too much to bear. And it WAS rough for a little while, but looking at these graphs, it’s shocking that I was actually in way more pain DURING the relationship than after (and even more than while it was ending and we were still living together). I’m happier now than I’ve been in the last year and a half. What a breath of fresh air. 

Sending love to you all. Being AP is hard as shit, but I still have hope that one day I’ll find myself in a relationship that serves me. One where I can grow with the other person.

256,How to use your anxious – avoidant relationship to grow and become securely attached ( for anxious folks),"Hi there everyone. I am reflecting on my own relationship at the moment, and wanting to write a little bit about how I have been using this relationship as an opportunity to grow into a more securely attached type. I’m going to use a couple of psychological frameworks, obviously attachment theory and also Ifs or internal family systems theory. This theory supposes that the mind is made up of an unknowable number of sub personalities, with an underlying true self that is in essence, a perfect attachment figure. This true self is capable of providing warmth and compassion to every part of us. Myself and my partner are both therapists. We are also both meditators with experience of examining our thoughts and feelings directly. I hope to be able to describe how being triggered can actually grow us considerably.

I have met someone with whom I have started to really feel my anxious attachment style. Often, when I get into relationships I usually feel like the less invested one, but with this woman I have fallen very quickly in love. It’s horrifying and wonderful all at the same time. I have never felt so vulnerable. I am used to being the helper, the one who can introduce the other into new realms of experience, and can remain in a subtly powerful position. With her, she was able to be with me through some things that no one else ever has. I started to fall in love, and I started to attach. It became very uncomfortable very quickly. I wanted to see her all the time, I felt easily confused or insulted by her avoidance, or I felt that she was inevitably going to hurt me or betray me. This is an unconscious and automatic pattern in my mind. Even while she definitely was able to reassure and be present with how I was feeling. 
I started to really realize that she could actually be trusted, even though she is somewhat avoidant.  We have incredible opportunity together, and we experience spiritual things with each other. We have been able to really open our hearts with each other, and when we are in this state, it is obvious to see the potential for secure attachment. 

But frequently we are not in this state. And so I have been practicing with my emotions in the meantime. Watching and observing, with as little judgment as possible, as my mind comes up with reasons to run away or to get upset. Sometimes I get a knot in my stomach or I feel sick. Other times I feel longing or I feel love or I feel aching in my heart. It can be truly agonizing.

When I turn inwards and focus on the sensations one of a few things tends to happen. 
Either I can’t tolerate it, and I reach out to friends or to my lover for reassurance. Hopefully directly and vulnerably, but sometimes indirectly and I’m looking at that. Sometimes I try to withdraw, hoping that they will be inspired to initiate contact. I’m still trying to understand if this is a good idea or not. It feels like a good idea… In that I am giving myself space to be independent. And I am allowing myself to trust myself alone, and it gives her a chance to have her own need for connection arise.

Other times, I turn inward and make contact with the aching part inside of myself. I have a young wounded child in me, and When I really go inside and listen, I can feel the longing and tenderness of this part of me reaching out towards this woman. It’s as if I can feel the aloneness and the pain of abandonment, and I can feel the part of me fixated on The provider of love and security. Of course, she is ultimately not that. And when I can fully be with this part, feeling it’s longing and listening to its cries inside of me, it will shift on occasion and turn towards me. It will allow me to hold it, the way that it wants to be held by her. In fact, because of the intensity of the longing that has occurred because of this relationship, I am able to make better contact with this part than I otherwise would be.  It’s been super up for me lately, and so I am able to experience it, even if it’s uncomfortable, more easily.  When this happens, I can cry. There is a release of tension, and this part of me feels loved and appreciated. I can feel it wound, and I can hold it tenderly. This seems to create the secure attachment inside of myself that I Truly long for. As much as it seems like your partner is going to somehow be the one who loves you, it seems to me that the deepest relationship you can have is with yourself. I often say, Nobody can go through the door of death with you.  In the moment of death, will I be able to tenderly appreciate my own vulnerability and loss of everything I have ever held to? Perhaps if I am generously loving towards myself during life…

Another, Third experience I have had is of a more sudden shift. Rather than an emotional release, I can have a sudden shift I. Perspective. One morning I was deeply feeling the confusion and longing, and as I was looking at a tree, I suddenly felt as though I would be all right. It was like awakening from a dream. I recognized my wholeness, and felt freedom from the whole thing. If she rejects me, so what? I still have myself. If the relationship ends? I will have used it to my fullest. And if Who I am is in someway intolerable for her, and it becomes obvious that she doesn’t really want my true self, then I will have given myself a full opportunity. Instead of trying to hide or suppress my needs and feelings, I will have been honest and real with myself, and actually given her the opportunity to love me and given myself the opportunity to love her. If somehow the relationship ends in this way, In these moments I recognize my wholeness. That it’s all right. I didn’t need her to be the one. It’s not death.

These are some of my reflections on this process. Perhaps I will write more at some point after I’ve gained more experience with this. Let me know if you have any thoughts or feelings, or if you have any of your own experience with practicing around your anxious style. Feel free to also say that I am barking up the wrong tree and will definitely get my heart broken :-) I’d love to hear what anyone has to share about this from their own experience.",lbf3tk,84,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/lbf3tk/how_to_use_your_anxious_avoidant_relationship_to/,AnxiousAttachment,1
257,"Experiences with partner, who deactivates/shuts down/emotionally detaches","hi,
I (AP) am curious how you guys experienced and felt when your SO would deactivate, shut down and/or emotionally detach. 
How did you find out? Did you understand what was going on right from the beginning? How was the first situation when it happened?

Before my relationship I only saw this behavior to some extent from my mother and I was really shocked and didn't understand when my then-gf (FA) did that for the first time. It was just so scary and I simply couldn't cope to see someone completely shutting down and needing space while I am begging them to open up and communicate again to solve that conflict. 

I am curious to hear how you guys felt in such situations. I never heard any of my friends having similar experiences, apparently I am the only one.",156xw8q,82,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/156xw8q/experiences_with_partner_who_deactivatesshuts/,AnxiousAttachment,1
258,Should I start blocking inconsistent men?,"I always seem to like guys more than they like me and trap myself waiting around for them thinking ""I'm over reacting, I'm just too needy, give them space/time"". But it sends me into an anxious spiral until I explode. I'm starting to think maybe it's just healthier that at the very first sign of inconsistency I should just block them. 

There's a guy who's a mutual friend of mine that I've had a crush on for quite some time. He at first showed interest and would call me just to talk for hours. Then he didn't speak to me for months. Over time I completely let go of any expectations and genuinely saw him as a platonic friend so one random day I sent him something on ig, truly not even expecting a response other than ""lol"" or a like. But he turned it into a whole convo and asked me about my recent vacation etc. 

At first I was dry but then I amped up my tone since he seemed interested and we had a pretty lengthy convo where he was showing interest, then out of the blue mid convo he left me on read. The last thing I sent wasn't just one or two words or anything dry, it was a chunky reply to what he said. So no reason to ignore. 

Then he liked my story a few days later? Did he just forget we were in the middle of a conversation? 

I just wanna block him. I feel confused and led on. But he technically never did anything bad to me and he isn't a bad guy. What if he sees me as a friend and gets really hurt that I would block him out of the blue? 

Now there's this guy who seemed obsessed with me at first. He wanted to see me every single day for a week so we did. And every day it was ""I like you so much, you're so cute etc."" then we texted every day and he would tell me he misses me/thinks I'm really special etc. so I started to really get feelings for him. 

Then out of no where he leaves one of my messages on read (just a heart emoji) and hasn't texted me in a week. But he liked a few of my posts and even shared one to his own story yesterday. But hasn't hit me up. He also hasn't talked about wanting to see me again. 

I want to block him. Bc I know if I just ""communicate my feelings"" it's gonna turn into his laundry list of excuses and he's so busy blah blah blah. I don't think he's been lying to me, I can tell he really likes me. So I don't wanna hurt him by blocking him randomly. But shit I'm hurting myself waiting around for his text. 

Blocking these guys would instantly cure my anxiety. But I would probably hurt them in doing so, and also be left wondering ""what if I just gave it time ?"" So I'm stuck. Do I try to suppress my anxiety and wait it out? Or block and run.",14e9iyu,82,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/14e9iyu/should_i_start_blocking_inconsistent_men/,AnxiousAttachment,1

261,So f**ckin tired of this attachment style - A vent.,"This anxious/insecure attachment thing is getting so out of hand. It makes me feel so anxious, insecure, powerless and mostly.. desperate. I get SO desperate for the attention and validation of whoever i'm talking to/getting to know in the dating world. It makes me feel so overwhelmed and it's exhausting. I feel like I can't date. IDK. I've dated around so much, I've been in so many situationships but it has only been recently where I've felt like I'm ready to look for a long-term partner. Well. I thought I was.

Why am I triggered rn? Because someone I have been getting to know really well over the past couple weeks hasn't texted me back in >24 hours. It doesn't help that I'm already super into her and my last text was about our next date. Granted, I know she's a shitty texture and I've been treating that as some sort of exposure therapy. Also, her last text to me didn't signal anything of disinterest or anything but even so.. I'm so goddamn anxious right now. Poor response times and slow texts has always been a trigger for me - more than anything else really.

I think what frustrates me most about this attachment style is that it is SO out of character for who I am. Most of (if not all) of my friends don't have a clue. In my day to day and in all my platonic relationships I am so confident, bold, secure and self-assured. I think I lead people to believe that I am untouchable. When in fact I care so much, so often and maybe too much. I get hurt, am sensitive and etc. I put up this front that I don't care and that I don't experience rejection or worries .. that I'm invincible. If you met me, you would have never guess I get anxiously attached!! I'm a busy person, I have shit to do. Stressing over texts is just not worth having on my agenda but it can't be helped. UGH.

And tbh I've tried so hard to talk myself out of it. I know my worth and what I want. I know that these interactions don't define me.

I don't know. I'm just feeling particularly triggered right now and it's super frustrating and i'm sooo sick of it.

264,Identifying Self-Abandonment,"We all know that abandonment is a core wound for anxious attachment, and that abandonment can take many forms. Most often we externalize this to others. Maybe it was because our caregivers in childhood were not there for us consistently or maybe even not at all. So due to that we focus on others abandoning us. Though that is just the more obvious way abandonment looks. Our caregivers could have also taught us to abandon ourselves, with little things like being taught not to trust or listen to ourselves, that our thoughts and feelings were not a priority. In turn, as adults, while we may have this focus on other’s abandoning us, we actually “abandon” ourselves first. We do this by being disconnected from our authentic selves, ignoring or downgrading our own feelings and needs, not listening to our intuition, putting others needs above our own...and so on. This all stems from the same issues that made us feel abandoned by our caregivers in some way, shape, or form. It's the basis of much of our limiting beliefs and narratives, which feed how we interact with others we have relationships with.

It is not. Look at the breakup subs. So many people in relationships with avoidants have been discarded. You can't fix or change this person. Not all avoidants are bad people, but a relationship with one will never work out. Also a lot of stories on here aren't even related to avoidance, you're just dating a horrible person.

268,He wants me to love him yet leave him alone at the same time. It's exhausting 💔,"What hurts the most about my relationship is the constant uncertainty. It's almost as if he wants to hold on to me but at a safe distance. Sort of like: *come to my house but we talk from the doorstep*. The invitation is there. The company is welcomed. Yet entry is still somewhat prohibited. And then when you leave because it's too cold to stay outside, they offer you a warm blanket and a spot at the outdoor heater. Means nothing though because it's not the same as being warm in front of a fireplace **inside**. When the outdoor heater isn't enough and I want to go elsewhere for warmth, he will give me his jacket and question why what he's providing isn't enough for me. It's almost like he's pushed me away but has held on to my neck so I don't actually go anywhere. And just as I finally have the strength to leave, he opens his door and let's me spend the weekend. He makes me feel at home. Monday comes and I ask about plans for another sleepover, suddenly I'm outside again without even noticing how I was placed there.

I'm using this example because this is how the relationship feels. He hates it when I bring up the future, despite it being 3 years. Yet when I start to plan for my own future, he gets worried that I want to leave. He needs space and doesn't always need to see me. Yet when I take some space for myself or plan a with friends, he shows an attitude or is upset he can't see me. He showers me with sex and physical affection yet he finds me too emotional when I want to discuss (any) topic on a deeper level. He wants me to love him and leave him alone all at the same time. 

I know most of you will tell me to leave. But I am not here for that because I already know I should. I just need a listening ear and some support.

270,Post-Breakup Processing for AP,"I (32M, AP) decided to end my relationship with my (31M, DA) partner about six weeks ago. We had been dating for four years, but had been FWBs for four years before that – I know, lots to unpack there. 

Things had been rocky for about eight months before we decided to mutually end it. Pretty typical story: I knew we had some minor issues like everyone, but thought that we were pretty solid/on marriage track when he dropped a bomb on me saying that he didn’t love me anymore, that he was feeling very trapped and overwhelmed as things seemed to be getting more serious. He needed his space and wanted to move out and for us each to have our own places while “working on the relationship.” We basically talked ourselves in circles for those eight months until we were each exhausted with the other and we decided to try out a temporary break that eventually became a breakup. 

I’m now six weeks out from the official end and just wanted to share a few things I’ve noticed and interested to hear if others have had similar/different thoughts:

* Healing/moving towards greater secure responses has been a lot of one-step forward, two-steps back. I’ve had to learn to be more compassionate with myself and stop a lot of the judging self-talk. Interestingly, my AP has often wanted me to hyperfocus on exact, precise steps/actions I should be taking to be moving forward, when in reality I needed to learn to just let things flow and focus more on consistent behavior changes instead of doing any one particular thing; it’s only been after some time has passed that I see how far I’ve come. Which leads to my next point:

* When things feel intense or urgent, that’s exactly when I need to be slowing down. Urgency has turned into one of my most reliable warning signs. When I feel the need to engage on an issue or a feeling *right this second*, that’s exactly when I know I shouldn’t take immediate action. Instead, I have to sit with the feeling (it’s very uncomfortable and early on it felt like I was dying) and just know that it will pass and that I will likely feel differently about it in a day or two; not necessarily better or worse (yes do it/no don’t) but just more nuanced about it. 

* I realized how much of myself I kept hidden from him and from myself in our relationship. I have a lot of hypervigilance from an anxious-narcissistic mother and because of that I’ve had a lot of trouble being my authentic self with other people; I’ve always thought it just made sense that of course I would use all of the information (phrasing, body language) that other people were throwing out to mold myself into the least objectionable/most helpful form, and then work towards my goals from there. I realize now that I did the same thing with my ex, becoming interested in his interests and using those as points of connection, but it’s only been lately that I realized that I was depriving him the opportunity of getting to know and connect with me on things I cared about, I guess I was worried deep down that he wouldn’t be interested and I wanted to avoid that disappointment. 

* Anger is a normal part of the process. I’ve been feeling this a lot lately. There’s been a lot of anger at him for his behavior but also a lot of anger at myself for letting things get as far as they did. I’m not sure yet what it all means, but I’m just letting it flow and some days the anger has turned into quick bouts of grief, but they’re becoming less frequent over time. They still surprise me though when they pop out of nowhere, coming in flashes of grief/crying.

* There’s also been a slight sadistic pleasure in watching his social media/hearing from mutual friends that he’s really stressed out at work and seems to be struggling right now too. I include this because I think for me, it sticks out because after years of him being cold/emotionally unavailable, it feels good to see him finally have some emotions. It’s not the case at all, but it feels satisfying because it almost feels like he’s finally emotionally attuning to where I’m at; something he was never capable of doing previously.  

I don’t know. I hope that helps if anyone is in a similar situation.",168voop,79,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/168voop/postbreakup_processing_for_ap/,AnxiousAttachment,1
271,What healing looks like for two insecurely attached partners actively working towards security.,"As an FA who's leaned anxious, I'm 2 years into my healing journey and counting. I married my avoidant partner in April who's been on this shared journey. We're both leaning more secure. I've shared quite a bit about my own personal journey and our relationship journey here. Feel free to explore my post history. I just wanted to share and remind you guys that true change is a process, for many, it'll be life long. I'm discovering things everyday about myself through the lense of my past. It's like writing a new story but it's sooooo worth it! My partner and I have come a long way since some therapy and practicing healthier relating when triggered. 

Like yesterday, I expressed something that caught my avoidant partner off gaurd which was about me feeling stuck at my job and just in life. I saw him withdrawing into himself and becoming uncomfortable. He'd taken it personally and that my feelings were based in what he lacks as a partner. I almost became completely triggered but I calmed myself, we went through our night, I told him I love him before bed. I know from what he's shared in therapy and with me before that he like many avoidants perceive criticism and rejection if their partners are unhappy. Just like more anxious leaning folks perceive rejection and fear abandonment in these scenarios. I decided to talk about it this morning and he explained exactly what I thought was going on in his head. Truthfully, I was frustrated that this is still a thing since I just want to be able to share with my partner how I feel in a non-criticizing vulnerable way without them taking it personally. So we closed the conversation for a couple of hours. But I remind myself, that I married this man knowing his tough childhood physical and emotional abandonment. 

So I went out to him on our patio. He expressed disappointment in himself for being triggered by his old programming and neglecting to meet me in that moment. That it sucked to be sitting across from his wife expressing dissatisfaction. That he felt responsible. I told him that I did just need his support and thanked him for recognizing that now. Then I told him that he doesn't know just how much his presence means in my life, healing our childhood wounds along side each other has been so tough but I have no desire to leave him. Especially with how I see him steadily evolving as I am. I smiled but I was also tearing up because vulnerability is hard. I look over and he's crying a bit too. He takes my hand and tells me he loves me. He'd panicked enternally because I am important to him. He helps me stand up, we embraced. This scenario just a year prior would have been a 3 day dramatic affair.",156ze9q,82,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/156ze9q/what_healing_looks_like_for_two_insecurely/,AnxiousAttachment,1
272,"Can a Man Be Anxiously Attached and Still Seen as ""Masculine?""","I'm anxiously attached in dating. I just got out of a 5 month relationship that ended because of my inability to give my girlfriend enough space because of my fears of abandonment. She also said it was hard for her to look at me as a confident masculine man because of my neediness.

I feel like anxiously attached women are able to be in relationships more easily because there isn't the same expectation of being a stoic ""rock"" the way women want their man to be.

273,How can I move from anxious attachment to secure attachment? I am really struggling.,"
How can I stop making my world revolve around my boyfriend? Almost 99% of our problems are due to me relying on him so much and being let down.  It seems as if I can’t do anything or go anywhere without my boyfriend. And he is totally okay with doing things without me, and I can’t seem to understand that. If he lags on me for 2 + hours I get so anxious , and I am constantly checking my phone, I catch myself doing it and i tell myself to stop, to do something else instead but there’s a voice in my head that is constantly saying,  “ check the phone he probably already answered”  I check and nothing, and i just get angry at myself for checking knowing damn well he didn’t reply and I get so angry for being this way, I feel humiliated.  


 I know that he has his own life, that it’s normal and healthy for him to be his own person, have a life besides our relationship and not expect him to be with me 24/7. But I don’t understand that I get so jealous and controlling. I get so insecure when he goes places without me. 

We got into a little argument yesterday because I just didn’t understand how he could be okay with going on a trip  without me, when I wouldn’t leave him.  His brother is going to Mexico with his boyfriend, and I had asked him if they invited him would he go( I can’t travel to Mexico, that’s why I wouldn’t be able to go with them) but he said yes, I don’t know why that hurt me so much, but it did. I wouldn’t even think of going to Mexico without him and leaving him behind, but without hesitation, he said he would. 

I know I’m wrong for thinking he should stay behind, and not go if they invited him but how can I stop thinking this way? Thinking as if I own him as if he needs to be with me all the time. He is so kind, and always makes sure that  I have what I need or want, I am not only hurting myself, but I am hurting him too, and I don’t want to continue doing so, because he doesn’t deserve this. I hate that I am like this, it is so draining, I know that I am wrong, I know that this is toxic behavior and I need to stop, but I don’t know how. 

(Please be kind, I don’t need to hear, “ you are so toxic” or things like  that , because I know, I thought about all the wrong things that I am already, I just want to know how I can fix this, thank you )",13qw3ai,79,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/13qw3ai/how_can_i_move_from_anxious_attachment_to_secure/,AnxiousAttachment,1
274,A breakthrough in Anxious Attachment with therapy,"If you are wondering: is what's happening to my relationships my fault or are they just avoidant/fearful, you've come to the right post!! 

Recently in therapy, I asked this question. He asked me 3 questions instead. 

1. How does this person make you feel? 
2. What does this person do for YOU?
3. What have other people said about this person/situation? 

In the case of my former best friend, she made me feel like I was always the villain and she the victim. When I asked objective 3rd parties about her sensitivity, they agreed that is was off the charts. So I let her go. 

In the case of my current partner, he makes me feel unwanted and demanding. Other people have told me to break it off. Here is why I didn't realize i needed to sooner, and you may also fall into this trap:

I thought a DA would be more callous. 

Like needing 3 days of ""space"" anytime you open up. Or leaving messages on read for a full day. I will list my partner's red flags so hopefully you won't make my mistake. 

1. Never confronted my trauma or anxiety. He stared at me blankly when i told him about my dark family history. 
2. Told me at month 3 that it would take him about a year to consider ""i love you."" 
3. He mentioned his FRIENDS say he's coldhearted. 
4. He didn't emotionally reassure me when i needed it most. 

I kept telling myself these were his ""quirks"" and i was at fault. After all, he was consistent in messaging me, saying goodnight and goodmorning. But I missed what he did when I opened up: 

He avoided. 

He didn't ask questions about my trauma. He didn't say ""no i definitely want to see you"" when i said ""it feels like you dont ever want to see me."" When i told him about a bad nightmare, he said ""that sounds heavy."" 

Fellow people here, you are sunflowers. You need light and love and water. Do not try to ask anything of a stone. A stone has no needs. A stone will not understand why YOU have needs. 

As long as you are working on your wound, remember: it is never all on you. Be more selfish. You only deserve the best.

275,My experience as an anxiously attached man,"I'm (27m) new to this sub, so I hope I don't sound like a million other posts, but I just wanted to describe my experience with the intersection of anxious attachment and being a man. 

I have been told I'm a pretty masculine man. I've worked as a mechanic, I have a deep voice, I have a beard, I like a lot of typically masculine things. I am in pretty good physical shape and I'm getting pretty strong. This is obviously pretty surface level stuff, but it's what is typically considered masculine. The reason I say this is because I have pretty severe attachment anxiety, and I really think that our culture has no ready-made role or societal niche for anxiously attached men. I'm not saying it's worse than being an anxiously attached woman. I have no idea what that's like. I just want to describe my own experience, as I've recently had a breakthrough into how to really integrate your attachment anxiety into your personality in a healthy way. This has taken me a very, very long time to realize, because for the longest time I had a hard to shake feeling that men are supposed to be not just secure, but almost avoidant. That's what our culture promotes in a host of ways. 

This made me absolutely loath myself. My attachment anxiety caused the end of my one serious relationship when I had two emotional breakdowns that made my girlfriend incredibly uncomfortable. That is the only relationship I've had. Since that happened, I've been absolutely terrified of having a relationship, and not only has it made me too scared to ask anyone out, but I am pretty sure it has given me an air of being closed off, or maybe desperate and self-centered.

I just felt like there was no place for a man like me. No one likes an anxiously attached man who can't stop thinking about having an intimate relationship. I'm a ""beta,"" or an incel, or a simp, or whatever. Men should be independent, and should have no problem hooking up and forgetting about it. 

I am currently in my master's degree to be a therapist, and I have been able to integrate most of my personality traits into my sense of self, but my relationship preoccupation is really one of the most central elements of my inner life, and it was something I could not handle. 

You might have experienced a feedback loop like this: 

""I am never going to have a stable, healthy relationship where I feel like my needs are met, so I'm always anxious with people I'm interested in, which makes me awkward and not myself, which means I am never going to have a stable, healthy relationship...""

You can break that feedback loop by learning to like who you are, but as a man, that's incredibly difficult if you're anxiously attached. A dark, irrational side of a lot men (or maybe it's just me) says ""even just thinking about ""having your needs met"" is feminine."" So the anxious attachment seems to make it impossible to like who you are, which makes it impossible to heal the anxious attachment. 

The other challenge is that it's very difficult to simply forget social norms and ""be yourself,"" when your main project in life is to be accepted. 

Okay, so what changed? How did I learn to be happy with my whole self, including my way of relating to others? 

In order for this to make sense, it might help to describe the actual event. I got two texts: one from the ex girlfriend (I'll call her Tiffany. We're now friends, but live several states apart), and one from my roommate. I am going to be visiting a group of friends including Tiffany, and she asked me about the ingredients for my favorite drink. I told her, and she replied saying everyone is excited for me to visit, and they will have the drink ready to go when I get there. It felt really great. 

While I was thinking about that text, I got the other text--an article that my roomate sent me that I found really interesting. That's when it hit me. Those of us with anxious attachment know what it means to want to be loved and appreciated more than most people do. We crave things like the text from Tiffany more than most, but everyone wants to feel loved. This awareness, as well as our tendency to be empathetic means that we are EXPERTS in giving this kind of affection. 

So I thought about how I could reply to my roommate in such a way that would embody this. After thinking about it, I said ""this is great, keep them coming. By the way, how did you discover (author's name)."" That's what I would want to hear. Doing this made me feel GREAT about myself. For the first time, I really saw what I wanted to be like as a person--as a man. 

We can be meaningfully, genuinely kind and generous in a unique and poweful way because of our personalities, and that has been the most healing thing I've experienced. And this healing is not a masculine or feminine thing, even if the place I was in before was colored by my masculine experiences. If you, regardless of your gender, learn to use your desire for others as a means of fulfilling that desire *in* others, I really believe you can learn to love yourself 

^(and as a bonus, people are going to absolutely LOVE having you around ;))",zru9hd,82,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/zru9hd/my_experience_as_an_anxiously_attached_man/,AnxiousAttachment,1
276,the avoidant butt kissing here is annoying,"Controversial post, but I don't mind. Luckily these posts are far and few in between. But when they do happen it's annoying. I lurk in this group read posts nearly everyday and I very rarely see anxious people that are so unaware and lacking in self reflection that they are anti DA. When they do appear, they rightfully got dog piled with down votes and comments holding them accountable.

At some point I noticed there were more posts complaining about anti DA posts than there were actual anti DA posts. From what I've seen here most anxious folks pretzel twist themselves into what their DA partner wants and people please only to feel resentful that none of their efforts were returned. Now, should they take a look themselves and ask themselves why they are so eager to over give to people who give them nothing?

Absolutely. Should they take accountability for their own actions, reactions, and inactions (which means if someone isn't treating you well... Leave!)? Absolutely. The problem with these ""anti DA"" posts is that it comes off as gaslighting. Another way of telling APs that their feelings and needs are too much and they need to pretzel themselves more into what society or DAs or who ever the crave approval from wants. It's any other way of telling APs that how they're treated is their fault. APs are allowed to be in pain. Especially considering a lot of them are new to attachment theory and are fresh out of a toxic draining relationship 

You'll never see avoidants making posts and threads with replies in the hundreds because they said something bad about APs. In fact you'll see replies agreeing that the AP behavior is toxic (which it is, I'm not saying the avoidants are wrong). Why is it when APs rant toxic DA behavior they get dog piled basically telling them that they're wrong for ranting and that they're anti DA? It's like if your going to rant about DAs you have to use fluffy language and borderline kiss their ass or you'll be told you're toxic. APs have the right feel their raw pain just like  avoidants do. 

I feel like a few people here over empathize with DAs lowkey seeking approval from them. Yes, we know DAs have their child hood traumas and pain too.. Their pain is valid and we know they're acting out of self preservation. But that doesn't get rid of the pain of being stonewalled, ghosted, gaslit, and horrifically criticized.

If you look at avoidant subs they mostly focus on their own healing and don't worry too much about what others are thinking of them. And that's how it should be. That is the healthy way to go about healing. You'll never see avoindants making threads complaining about ""anti AP"" posts. They created a small safe haven, for themselves, by themselves and that is awesome. Yet when I come here I see posts that are too concerned with avoidants feelings.

I think what happens here is that a lot of APs have fawning as their trauma response. So this results in a lot of self abandonment and indirect shaming of other people that are similar to their unhealed traits.  Nobody wants to look like the cringy needy unaware  AP. So it's easy to point to someone who is new in their healing and be like ""see I'm not like THOSE APs! That behavior is toxic unlike me!"", it's almost like shaming yourself through another person who's like you. 

I'm hoping this sub can just stay on track with our own issues and not be so concerned with avoidants who which, ultimately don't concern themselves too much about what APs think of them. Respect and have compassion the avoidants, respect and have compassion yourself, and focus on *you* because *you* deserve it too.",uhikgx,81,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/uhikgx/the_avoidant_butt_kissing_here_is_annoying/,AnxiousAttachment,1
277,How to stop overthinking every single text conversation,"For context, my SO and I are currently long distance and in completely different timezones. We usually have a short text conversation in the morning for me which is right before bed for them. 

So today, we had a conversation and I phrased something I had done in the past in a very roundabout way (idk I was groggy and had just woken up). They said the timeline of what I was saying didn't add up, in a joking manner. I immediately got defensive because I thought they were trying to catch me in a lie and described everything in detail, to which they responded by saying that they were just teasing me. I didn't want them to think that I was just making this up or was lying to them. The immediate next text was about how they were super sleepy and were going to crash. We said goodnight and that was that.

I've been feeling really anxious since then. Did they think I was lying just to impress them? What else do they think I lie about? Why did they want to verify my timeline? I'm really insecure in our relationship and constantly feel the need to ""impress"" my partner so the fact that the possibility that they think I might be lying just makes me very anxious. Now, I'm just counting down the hours till they wake up so I know everything is okay. Ughh I hate living with anxiety.

279,The APs handbook: Step 1: make a pros and cons list. Step 2: proceed to ignore list full of red flags,"Thought I’d just share a little something which with the benefit of hindsight I think is pretty funny.

First, some whistle stop context for you. I’m 33M, AP and going 4/4 for toxic relationships with unavailable partners. After four years of therapy and introspection, I thought I was obviously ready to get it right with a more suitable partner.

Enter *her*. Three weeks of pure magic suddenly turned to a week of absolute hell as the red hot fire suddenly and unexpectedly (with no explanation from her ofc) turned icy cold with a side of intense anxiety and pain.

But I’m aware™ now so I know what’s up. I’m too attached to somebody I hardly know and all I need to do is just unattach a little bit. I'm clearly idealising her, so I know, I’ll make a pros and cons list which should hopefully pull me back from the brink.

Here’s the list I put together at the time:

**Pros**

* Pretty
* Smart
* Talented
* Sex is great
* Been in therapy
* Sociable
* Sweet *(not actually true)*
* Great apartment 
* Wholesome *(not actually true)*
* Same religion

**Cons**

* Doesn’t make me laugh that much
* Not a great texter - not often enough, and doesn’t send stuff about her day which I'd like
* Pretty selfish in bed - doesn't reciprocate 
* Differing schedules
* Likely emotional baggage *(not denigrating this of course - I have this too)*
* We don't seem to like the same things
* We don't seem to like *doing* the same things
* Less passionate about culture than I am
* Doesn’t seem communicative
* Wants to take things much slower than me (aka casual)

So fellow APs, what did I do with this list? This list so full of red flags it could be a Chinese military parade? This list where the cons are all relational and show a remarkable incompatibility in almost every way, and the pros a basic laundry list of tickbox adjectives?

Obviously i concluded she is still utterly perfect and I’ve finally found my soulmate! Full steam ahead! <3 <3 <3 <3

&#x200B;

I know I'm making light of this, but it's just such an absurd example of how difficult it can be to actually make rational decisions (even when you *know* what to do) when already activated. At the time I really was in pain and even though this should have been my out, I unfortunately just couldn't see what was written down right in front of me.

Something I'm hoping will prevent this in future is getting my friends and family to hold me accountable. I've told them I have a bad picker and have asked them to be forthright with their judgements about my relationships. Next time I'll show them the list and hopefully they'll see the red flags I refused to see!

P.s. if you're curious,  it ended in a puff of smoke a few weeks later when I did actually express a need for consistency that she refused to fulfill. I was sad ofc but in the end I feel very lucky to have escaped the trap early this time (I'm not quite 5/5 yet).",13iglfe,80,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/13iglfe/the_aps_handbook_step_1_make_a_pros_and_cons_list/,AnxiousAttachment,1

But guess what, I didn't do it! I was so disappointed and turned off by his lack of awareness, it really grossed me out.

284,The long anticipated breakup finally happened,"My (31F, AA) boyfriend (33M, avoidant of some kind) of nearly 4 years and I finally broke up this weekend after damn near a year and a half of feeling like this was inevitable. 

I am so tired. I’m tired from the last two years of walking on a tightrope trying to figure out the exact things he needed to be happy and stay with me. I’m tired from carrying the weight and responsibility of the relationship on my shoulders. I’m tired from listening to words that don’t match actions and I’m tired of being gaslit into thinking there weren’t any issues just because he was too uncomfortable to talk to me about them. I’m tired from being forced to live in almost constant discomfort for years so that he didn’t have to be uncomfortable for even 5 minutes. I’m tired from him blaming his ADHD for everything and I’m tired of feeling like I go through every day trying to make his life easier because that felt like an act of love, while simultaneously having to beg for him to do almost anything for me. I’m tired of reading books on attachment theory and adult ADHD in relationships to try to fix myself when I honestly didn’t need that much fixing to begin with.

And if I’m being honest, I’m tired from reading and refreshing this sub multiple times a day in a desperate attempt to find some solidarity or some lightbulb moment where things will click into place for me and I’ll either finally realize my worth and have the confidence to walk away or I’ll figure out the magic combination that will make things work. 

I watched a video a few months ago of a man who had gone through a divorce that he openly admitted was his fault. Him and his ex had gone to couples therapy post divorce to try to improve their relationship for co-parenting reasons and he said the thing his ex wife said that has stuck with him through the years was that she felt as though he got to walk away from their marriage with all these things he learned about himself, while all she got were things she had to unlearn. And I’m thinking about that a whole fuck of a lot today.

I really, really don’t think this is what relationships are meant to look or feel like, y’all. I’m reminded now of the refrain I took on when my last ex and I broke up - I don’t know that I have an actual anxiety problem as much as I feel like I maybe had a bad partner problem.

“Hey there. Thank you for your vulnerability and sharing about what sounds like such a cruel relationship. I’m glad that you’re out of that relationship, but understandably abusive relationships leave lingering feelings and fears that can be triggered. It’s good to hear that you’re trying to work through those wounds on your own. 
I’ve had to learn and unlearn a lot about how I project my past trauma into relationships that have or had nothing to do with my past trauma. Awareness about that projection is a big step, so I wish you the best when it comes to healing that part of you. 

It’s not that you fucked shit up, but I don’t think this feels right to me anymore. This feels a little too difficult and fragile so early on into our reconnection. I don’t like feeling compared to my past self when I thought this was about us trying things out again as the people we are now. I know I’m a very different person than the person you met like 6 years ago when I was in active addiction. 

I was really into you and I still feel that you’re a beautiful, special person. I tried very hard to be affirming and reassuring, especially after you voiced that need. But to me it feels like my attempts and actions aren’t having much effect or being taken seriously. I tried to give you what you said you needed, but I don’t think I can do that anymore. I hope you realize that you’re very worthy of a safe, caring relationship with someone who values you and where you value yourself.”

287,realizing you didn't like the person as much as you thought,"Attachment sure does have a way of tricking you into pedestalizing someone. I just thought about how after nearly every relationship I've had, once I've finally moved on, I realized that I actually didn't like the person that much. 

I became obsessed with the idea of them in my head. I was obsessed with a fantasy, not the real person. And I feel like that affected my behavior in the relationship too. I started viewing them (although unintentionally) as a possession for my own comfort. 

Like a child that hangs on to their security blanket to feel safe. It's really easy for me to get to that point if I get lovev-bombed. All the feel good chemicals I get from the attention makes me feel like they're a drug or something. And that I need to keep chasing them to get that high. 

Once I've gained distance I can see them for who they are more clearly and I can make more logical decisions. I think this is why I don't particularly let people get too close to me and I don't like compliments at first. Because I feel like once someone gets into my head, they have complete power over me. It's a very uncomfortable feeling. 

I'm starting to understand why space is so important. I feel like If had more of a life of my own and gained my self esteem from other places than my exes, I wouldn't have had such a hard time leaving.

But for those of you, who're truly here to heal, you'll want something other than being validated for your suffering, you'll want real change and I can tell you it's 100% possible. Don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise, or tells you how to act in your relationship or what's healthy for you to do. No one knows what you should do, only a part of you that you're repressing due to childhood shit - your only job is to free that part. Your emotional life is more related to your internal world than your external circumstances, so as long as you come here to try to heal while focusing on everything external in the present, you're missing the opportunity to revisit your past and achieve the internal changes you actually need to achieve the external changes you long for.

Talking about your problems over and over is not going to heal you... Your subconscious learns through repetition plus emotion, so every time you complain here while feeling shitty dissing your ex, you're actually rewiring your brain to believe what you already believe subconsciously: you're the victim and you have to protect yourself by gaining control by any means necessary - for APs the response just happens to be fawn rather than flight like for avoidants. This is what gives APs the sense of moral superiority. You're not morally superior, you just learned to keep yourself safe by going closer to your partner rather than away. It's not healthier, it's just more socially accepted.

Emotional venting is only good to keep the status quo. It changes literally nothing, all it does is let you release some steam so you don't have to actually do anything differently. Problem-frustration-release and round and round you go, all you did was let off some steam so you can continue the cycle. If you constantly emotionally vent, you don't want to change. You want people to change so you can stay the same, which makes you kind of a hypocrite. And the people who think they're being super compassionate by validating your emotions? They're practicing idiot compassion that will cause pain in the long run, but it does make you feel right in your wrongness for the few seconds it takes to release the steam.

Avoiding your triggers is actually robbing yourself of the opportunity to heal your wounds. You can keep shitting on avoidants and act like avoiding them will make you feel better, but all you're doing is avoiding your triggers so you don't have to deal with your actual feelings, instead they stay repressed and will later appear as somatic symptoms or generalized anxiety/depression. And if you managed to find a partner that's compatible wiith your triggers, good luck with parenting! You'll definitely fuck up your children due to your unresolved issues, just like your parents did with you and you won't even notice.

You're not a victim. You're an adult human being with a lot of agency over your own life and choices. If you believe anything else, you're stuck in an old lie from your childhood when you may have been an actual victim and actually powerless, your subconscious never got the memo that you're an adult now and things have changed. Your avoidant is not making you feel anything that you're not feeling already. They're just stepping on the same landmine over and over that was already planted therebefore they even knew you.

You're not empathetic, you're codependent. You don't have true empathy, you have empathy until you can get your needs met by having it aka ""if I do xyz, maybe you'll love me and I'll feel worthy."" but then if they don't play into you getting that? That empathy is now anger and resentment, and ""how could they?"" That's circumstantial empathy at best, and even then it's with a hidden agenda. APs fawn, avoidants flight, that's the difference that gives you a sense of righteousness because fawning is socially acceptable, or often actually expected.

You don't have control, you never will. Life has control and it can always pull out the rug from underneath you, the problem in your relationship is that both sides are desperately trying to get control to make themselves feel safe. If you only feel good when you have control that means you don't trust yourself, other people, or the world, which always always causes suffering.

I know a lot of you will not agree, and that's ok. I have more experience, evidence, and proof of all of this being true than I could count, but you don't have to follow my advice or even agree with it. You can do what you want, just don't try to parade around in your righteousness as if you were actually trying to change. You want to vent, release, and place your frustration anywhere externally, but you do not want to do anything differently or look within to be able to address your own pain.",vlufn5,78,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vlufn5/this_sub_became_a_circlejerk/,AnxiousAttachment,1

291,Are Avoidant People Really the Problem with Dating?,"I found this article to be really useful and hope it can help anyone who reads it

\-----

As someone who has had to work my ass off to earn my emotional security through the years, I understand my clients when they constantly text me asking if the latest date is really interested in them.  Or when they ask for “techniques” to get someone to fall for them. Or when someone simply plays hot and cold.  I remember those days when I would sit with my girlfriends and do the same thing.  I’ve learned from all of these experiences that if you need to host a play by play viewing party, your anxiety has been activated.

While it may be easiest to blame an avoidant partner (as conventional dating advice often encourages us to do), the real lesson that needs to be learned is to face your anxiety and earn your self-confidence back.  That’s right, the annoying avoidant partner is really your best opportunity to overcome your anxiety.

Carl Jung says, “Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.”  If we are getting annoyed at someone’s perceived unavailability, what does that really say about our own availability?

## Breaking the Rules to Clear my Relationship Karma

I recently was introduced to someone through a mutual friend that I quite liked.  He, however, had all the classic signs of someone emotionally avoidant right from the start.  As a refresher (or in case you didn’t know that you can assess this stuff early on, here were some of the red flags):

* Pining after an ex and discussing why he should have married her
* Acting like a boyfriend but still talking about dating other women
* Withholding sex without discussing why
* Constant pushing and pulling

In the past, all of these behaviors would have put me on the defensive and broken me down emotionally.  Yet, at this point in my life - having had to work on my own abandonment and anxiety issues -  I was able to see the behavior from a more mindful and less personal perspective.  This guy was scared like hell about relationships EVEN THOUGH HE DESPERATELY WANTED TO BE IN ONE.

It made me sad and yet I knew that we were drawn to each other in order to help clear each other’s karma related to past relationships.  I needed to stand firm in my boundaries and speak my truth about what it is that I really want and he needed to learn that not all woman are crazy people out to steal things from him.  I showed up for him as an example of what love and acceptance really is and he showed up to remind me of how much relational trauma can royally mess up someone’s view of romance.

During our time together, he mentioned on a number of occasions that men often act like jack asses because they have been hurt by a woman.  This is consistent with what I have seen in my practice.  He went on to tell about how he had his heart broken when he was in his early twenties and how much this has affected his ability to trust women and be in a real relationship.  The real issue was not having this experience.  The real issue is that he was still angry about it - he was much further behind in his healing journey.  It was at that point I realized that this was indeed a karmic relationship and I needed to pay attention to what was transpiring.

## Conventional Dating Advice Gone Bad

In these circumstances, conventional dating advice often tells people to run like hell away from the other person.  We promote a lot of fear of other people and we teach people to succumb to the anxiety that they feel when they are unsure of how someone feels about them.  Instead of promoting a positive view of a difficult situation, we take our emotions and our anxiety at face value and do a hell of a lot of damage to each other.

It’s no longer necessary. We all have a choice to make.

## New Rules for Dealing with Avoidant Attachment Styles: Why Mindfulness is Necessary in Dating

In the United States, we have a fantasy that meeting the right person will fill an empty place in our heart.  We believe that someone else can give us what we are missing.  We spend countless hours searching and auditioning prospective partners in an endless quest of finding “the one.”  Yet, we do not spend nearly as much time working on ourselves to earn the emotional security necessary to actually be in a real relationship.  Someone else’s behavior should not make or break your day but provide you enough data to determine how you should move forward.

***In other words, their perceived emotional unavailability should be a sign that you are too available and a warning that you are abandoning yourself and setting up a co-dependent relationship.***

How did I break the rules in my situation? I spent too much time with him early on (including playing house - which has never happened before).  It was never planned and it kind of just happened due to me traveling and not necessarily being in a normal routine but I needed to own the fact that I was avoiding my writing and my work life.  I really liked this guy but my intuition kept saying that my role was to be more helpful than what i could expect to receive in return.

This realization pissed me off at first.  And then it hit me one day like a ton of bricks.  I was meditating in a beautiful park when visions of why my relationships with exes did not work.  I’ve had this pattern of abandoning my own interests and my higher self in the past. I would stop dancing.  I would stop working on creative projects.  I would sit and wait until he came home to make plans etc… This was THE opportunity to break that cycle and ascend to a higher levels of self-care.  So when he, for a second time, called me “too sensitive,” I cut him off and stated that he sent mixed signals.  I told him that that was not my issue and he could call me when he was ready to acknowledge his own fear of being in a real relationship AND that I would always be supportive if he needed anything.   He went silent.  I don’t think he said anything because I don’t think he was aware of how much fear and anxiety he was living in.  We stopped the conversation before it got too stressful and went out for ice cream.  We laughed.  We enjoyed our time together.  The next day,  I got busy planning my tango schedule, planning a weekend away, and catching up on much needed work.

We eventually went our separate ways without a lot of drama - for which I am grateful for. Karmic relationships really are like that.  While it continues to be an unclear situation it is not a crazy making situation simply because I saw the lesson in the connection and accepted it for what it was.  We both continue to have work to do and we came together to learn valuable lessons.  We honor and respect each other but most of all, my perception of emotional avoidance has changed significantly and allows for the compassion needed to more securely step away from someone else’s troubles and find my own center.  Learning to deal with my anxiety and self-soothe is the lesson that being in contact with emotionally avoidant people teaches.  Projecting blame on others without working on ourselves is simply a waste of time and energy. They are perfect situations to practice becoming still within oneself and listening to your intuition.

## Meditation and Avoidant Attachment Style

If you have been on a spiritual path as an effort to explore your own anxiety and heal relational trauma, the avoidants will show up.  They show up because they are trying to heal but don’t have a clue as to where to start! The best thing you can do is maintain your daily practice, be a good role model as it pertains to boundaries, and trust your intuition.  Meditation will be the secret to keeping yourself balanced enough to see the avoidant’s behavior for what it really is (their fear projected) and not take it personally.  It will also give you the space you need to decide if you have to walk away.  The truth is that the more relational trauma someone has had the more of a journey they need.  Sometimes they are willing to walk that journey and sometimes they are avoiding facing themselves.  You do not need to continue to sacrifice your higher good to accommodate their broken hearts.  You simply need to follow your higher good and keep moving forward with grace.

The biggest point to take away is that just because you understand where they are coming from does not mean you are the person to help them.  Sometimes you meet because you are simply supposed to give them your therapist’s phone number!  If you can maintain your compassion with appropriate boundaries, you can help change the world one intimate connection at a time.

292,First time I realize on my own that I create stories in my head,"I never realized it, but texting is the worst way to communicate with someone. I don’t know why I never thought of it before. 

My date is currently at home with a headache. We talked about the day being hard, and that he’s going to bed soon to fight that. 
I said « it will all be fine, and in any case, I’m here for you » (meaning : if you want to talk about your bad day, or not talk about your bad day but talk about anything else, I’m here for you). 

Now. He liked it. Like the little heart thing on IG. I don’t know why I expected an answer from that. When I know for a fact he’s not one to write a whole peplum about how great I am for saying that. How narcissistic of me. Another realization. 

So I started to do some research, i.e Google « Anxious Attachment Liking Message Not Answering ».
And then I realized by reading stuff … texting is the worst medium to say something like that. And also, I’m expecting an answer by saying something nice (which I 100% think by the way, this is not a game played or something) when the other person is at home with an headache. 

I don’t see him. I can’t see him. Maybe he smiled. Maybe he’s holding his head because of the pain. So there’s no reason to spiral on something like this.

I have updated the About section and Rules. So please have a look. The Rules are in effect immediately. I encourage you to see them as the ""boundaries"" and ""deal breakers"" for this sub. Please respect them. Breaking the rules will lead to removal of posts and/or comments. Repeated offenses will lead to being banned from the sub, either temporarily or permanently.

In time I will also be updating/fine tuning the FAQ section. And as I get things more organized I will also be looking to expand the Mod Team to help keep things running smoothly. I will post more about that when the time comes.

I have managed to clean up the very long Report queue. I will be keeping a close eye on it as well. As I am still just one person, there may be minor delays in reviewing any reported posts and comments, but be certain I will check them in a timely manner.

Thanks!

Update Edit: Learning to operate within the bounds of other people's boundaries (aka rules) is in important relational technique. While the boundaries are just the edges of a space, make sure you are turning around and looking at the space within. There is so much to be talked about in this space. And the rules are not saying the relationships are a taboo subject. The point is to guide you within yourself to figure out how you as an individual are relating and focusing on what limiting beliefs hold you back from relating in a healthier way. The amount of down votes I have gotten for stating the importance of healing yourself first, is only further proof, that these rules are needed. As many are not coming here to truly learn about anxious attachment and heal themselves.

303,THAT feeling when you get a text/validation,"So I have textbook anxious attachment I believe from my childhood. And I of course always end up dating or purely just interested in people who are hard to get /avoidant. 

The problem I’m having is I’m talking to this girl (few dates, back and forth, nothing huge) and not sure if she likes me even after having been talking for a while. But I’ve noticed that when I get a text from her (especially after not getting a text from her for more than a few days), I get a HUGE immediate rush/high/whatever you wanna call it. It’s literally like a dopamine rush or a caffeine hit or getting an A on a test you studies hard for and I instantly become happier. Like I’ll be more talkative, energetic, confident. Mainly because obviously I get that validation knowing she still likes me or maybe deeper knowing that she hasn’t “left” me yet. 

But the problem is that if I’m getting this rush when I get a response from her, it naturally means I was in a relative low before the text. It’s not like I’m depressed or anything, but I’ve always hated how I’m so dependent to be really happy on external things like a girl showing validation for me. It’s like even now, a text from her would calm my “anxiety”. I’m able to do day to day things fine and happy, but it would become better if I had that. I think I’ve become so used to needing that validation that I don’t even notice when I’m being triggered or realizing that I need a text back to be happier. 

And of course, the feeling fades. I eventually get stressed again when I don’t get a text or validation and the cycle continues. I know I’m probably trying to recreate my past by unconsciously getting those ambivalent feelings of attraction and that’s what drives me. 

I saw a video saying people who have anxious attachment literally get a dopamine rush when they get that text. And then have stress hormone cortisol when it goes away. And it literally becomes an addiction like a drug to get that rush back. And that’s how I kind of feel.

304,Coping with inconsistency in a healthy way?,"Do you guys have any tips for handling inconsistency in people’s responses/moods? Like many of us, I’m way too hypervigilant of normal changes in moods, behaviors, responses, etc. If I notice a negative change I go into panic mode and want to fix it—as if they’re not allowed to be a human with a full range of emotions. 

I realize how harmful that mindset is and how it’s exactly what my parents did to me. So I’m really trying to learn how to be okay with these changes and with people expressing negative feelings, or not always sounding excited to talk to me. I’ve been making a lot of progress, but for example I absolutely hate the sinking gut feeling I get whenever the person I’m interested in seems off or in a bad mood. It’s especially bad since there’s physical and emotional distance due to him needing space to heal his trauma, so I have almost no way of feeling reassured except when he decides to be more affectionate or sends videos of himself playing guitar, etc. I appreciate those little moments so much but it stings a lot when things inevitably go back to feeling “off.”

Anyway, I would love to hear any insight you guys have on how to better cope with the anxiety that comes with sensing these changes.

305,Just a few reminders to the anxiously attached in relationships with the avoidant attached:,"Avoidants have an extremely difficult time allowing themselves to feel their feelings, understand them, and communicate them. If they cannot properly manage their own, they WILL NOT be able to handle yours, especially when anxieties are high.

Continuing to chase them/try to save them will continue to reinforce their tendencies to avoid in the long term. Sure, things can be good in the short term, but until the trauma and tendencies are seriously and consistently worked on, the core operation will still exist and cycle. They may or may not reach a point where they want to work on their trauma and heal these tendencies, but they have to figure out how to do this on their own. This is the same for us anxiously attached individuals. We cannot resolve our anxieties to get to a secure attachment if we keep counting on their attention to give us relief.

310,But our connection and chemistry are unique...,"I'd like to share my story for everyone who is currently struggling with being in a relationship where their needs are not met.

After my relationship with a DA ended I found out about attachment theory. I read a lot of stuff on the internet and on Reddit in particular. I was convinced that my situation was absolutely unique, that nobody had the same bond, chemistry and connection as my DA ex and me.

Boy was I in for a surprise!

I was reading other people's stories and it sounded like they had all dated my ex. Down to the lovebombing, future faking  the exact same excuses when they flaked, the inability to change.

Some people on here ask about advice regarding how to help their avoidant partner to change.

The bitter truth is that you can't. They have to recognise that there is an issue, would want to work on it and do the hard work.

You must never neglect your own needs in order to not scare away a partner who is not doing their share. 

If you are overthinking, over-accommodating and over-compromising you are not in a healthy relationship. 

Speak up about your needs, find a solution together and if they are not capable of meeting you halfway do not stay and give them space and time. It's not going to change them. I did and suffered for 2 years.


So please everybody who thinks that their situation is different, read the stories on here, evaluate whether you are getting what you need. If not you are wasting your time.

Finishing on a positive note, there are so many people on here who have worked on themselves, know how to communicate and show up for their partner. This makes me hopeful for my next relationship.",v2kmwu,75,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/v2kmwu/but_our_connection_and_chemistry_are_unique/,AnxiousAttachment,1

I'm day 3 no contact. 

Didn't sleep well yesterday and a part of me hopes we get back together. But I know that I'll only get heartbroken and broken up with again

I don't deserve to be stonewalled, or someone who refuses to really talk about the issues we had.....which was him not putting in as much effort as before and pulling away.

I'm scared I'll give in when he comes back. Last time I went 4 days no contact and when I broke it he was talking about how he has so much to make up for and how he's gonna do better. 

I hate that I love him. And I hate the fact that other than him being an avoidant he is the man of my dreams. 

 I'm really scared of not being with him.
 I'm scared of ending up alone.

I hate that I'm not like other people who have healthy long term relationships. I feel broken.

But I have to choose myself. And I want healthy love int he long run.

312,a good partner will want to hear your thoughts/feelings/concerns. Do not forget you are wanted.,"As someone who has recently become hyper aware of how my anxious emotional reactions were the detriment of my last relationship, I’ve been swinging the opposite direction in my current relationship and trying really hard not to “rock the boat”. It’s been such a struggle to differentiate when is a time for me to express my needs and when it is a time for me to self soothe. I think this is the biggest question for an anxious person as they are becoming more aware of their reactions. 

This weekend I am on a family trip and it just happened to be on the same weekend my partner’s friends have their birthday celebrations in places that involve a lot of drinking and overnight sleeping. When my partner brought this up to me, I immediately felt my throat/chest tighten up but just sort of nodded and was like, “okay no problem have fun!!”

My thoughts have been spinning out of control on this trip and though I thought I’d been keeping my cool & that my partner hadn’t noticed, the next day after one of the parties he told me to call him and said we could discuss any concerns I had going into the overnight trip. On the phone I was a bit brief with him basically saying my concerns were just the usual what he’d think but I have no choice but to trust him.

The phone call ended and i felt a little bit weird and disconnected and texted him more authentically and said hey I’m sorry I was like that on the phone, the truth is is I have been having a hard time not wanting to be that annoying gf but I’ve been feeling a bit anxious. I felt like there was nothing I could do about it so I was just trying to push the feeling down.

He told me he had sensed my anxiousness and wanted me to tell him my concerns/feelings, and that it wasn’t annoying at all, and that next time just tell him and we could talk about it.

I was like oh. Wow

It seems so obvious but us anxious people for some reason forget that we are actually cared for and that our secure partners WANT to know how to make us feel more comfortable/loved/seen. Maybe you’re in a relationship with an avoidant (like I was in my previous relationship) so this might not FEEL applicable to you. But I do think your avoidant partner does want these things, they just won’t be able to give it to you in such a freeing, immediate comforting way as you may need. You may need to exercise patience with this, or revaluate whether that is something you can handle. 
BUT with an avoidant or secure partner, remembering your partner WANTS to love you and you are deserving &amp; worthy DESPITE your feelings of shame is so so so important in moving towards security.

313,"Best response to ""let's be friends"" after breakup?","I was recently broken up with and have been actively trying to fix my anxious tendencies. I'm hurt and upset, and the person who dumped me immediately went to: let's be friends. They want to continue hanging out as if nothing had happened! They also said that they ""never want to talk about the conflict"" that initiated the breakup again.

I'm hurt and haven't even expressed how hurt I am. I feel like the relationship was primarily about my sacrificing myself on the alter of her personal trauma and overwhelm. I care about this person and want her to heal. I even hope that their breaking up with me was reactive, in the moment, and that she'll come to her senses.

314,3 years of hard mental health work. I finally scored a secure attachment.,"I went from disorganized to secure. Honestly, I feel like a completely different person than I was 3 years ago.

315,"Sometimes, it’s not me, it’s you.","I came across a post that went something like: 

“There’s nothing wrong with you feeling anxious, when they withdraw.
You’re not crazy for feeling crazy, when they don’t communicate. It’s not that you have anxious attachment, that you feel anxious, when they are giving mixed signals. It’s not fear of abandonment when you feel uneasy with a lot of time apart. The only thing that is wrong is that you don’t validate your feelings and stand up for what you deserve. Stop diagnosing yourself for being human.”

Now I’m not saying that I don’t exhibit anxious attachment characteristics, but I also believe Anxious Attachment is closer to Secure Attachment than Dismissive Attachment is to Secure Attachment. 

I’m a big lover, a gift giver, altruistic, an artist, a letter writer, big heart person. Creative. Joyful. Spirited. My DA ex made me feel ashamed of some of the BEST things about me. I want deep connection. 

So when they call you needy, look at how they approach the idea, of needing things from others. 

When they say you’re clingy, look at how they’re afraid to hold onto anything. 

If they think you’re demanding, look at how they view the idea, of asking for help. 

Be gentle with yourself. Sometimes it’s not you, it’s them.

316,Facing rejection,"Person I've been dating for a few months but we met years ago. He's a textbook avoidant. I just need to vent and hoping someone can relate or share encouraging words. 

He started out so consistent in terms of communication. Texting me every so often and randomly hitting me with compliments and ""I miss you""s. It was so cute. 

But it started to slow down. I said this made me sad and he reassured me how he felt and explained that he can't be too communicative over text be he can reassure me if I feel sad. so that eased my anxiety pretty much permanently. From that point on I just didn't care when he wouldn't reply for hours. Crazy such a small amount of reassurance can ease me so much. 

Anyway lately communication has been null. Mostly me texting first. I was feeling distant from him so I decided to plan a little trip with him and he seemed excited. He gave me a bunch of ideas for our trip and he was the one mostly invested. We confirmed days and looked at airbnbs. My only stipulation was that I needed us to solidify plans within the next few days bc of work and money situations. 

He promised we'd confirm things in 1-2 days (his words). Well 3 days passed. Each day I reached out to get an update. Day one he put it off, day two an excuse, day 3 I asked him to let me know when he can confirm things and he just says ""ok"" 

Day four I wanted to reach out again but the anxiety kicked into over drive. Will I come across as annoying if I text him too much? Maybe I should just shut up and take a damn hint? Na don't be silly, you have to ask for reassurance. But what if that turns him off or annoys him? Am I being annoying? Am I being Selfish? 

I sent and unsent like 5 different messages, all variations of ""what's going on? Everything ok? Did you change your mind?"" 

He responds after my like 5th unsend, dry and cold. ""I can't do what you want me to do this fast."" 

It sent me over the edge. He saw my messages? And ignored them. Didn't bother chiming in even tho he could clearly see me unsending stuff anxiously. Over the course of an hour. He could've said something nice and reassuring. ""Hey still looking forward to our plans just need more time"" or something idk. He knows I get anxious, and we've communicated about it before. 


I was so chest-burningly anxious that I said ""don't worry I don't want to go on a trip with you anyway. Let's cancel our plans"" 

And he says ""ok"" 

The next morning I asked ""so just to be clear here you meant that you didn't want to go on this trip with me right""

And he goes ""nope never said that, you're being delusional bc ur anxious and I can't deal with that. So yeah I'd much prefer to cancel the trip plans"" 

I was so so hurt. He knew how excited I was about this. He also failed to reassure me in those few days when clearly I was getting anxious. 

For whatever reason he had been slowly losing interest in me and this was his opportunity to cut and run without seeming like the bad guy. Just puts it all on me and ghosts. 

I feel rejected and sad and hurt and disappointed. 

I apologized for my reaction and told him that because I'm anxious I need reassurance and clearly he can't give that to me so we probably aren't a good match

Left on read. After years of friendship. Cool. Rejection hurts.

Update: I reached out again to check in and ask if we are ok. He said we're ok and that he's taking time to think about what happened/what to say and he's just been feeling weird but we are fine. he texted me back a next day explaining in very great detail and multiple long paragraphs everything he's been going through. Health issues with his father, among other things. He apologized a couple times for not communicating enough and took responsibility for triggering my anxiety by being so distant and unclear. I'm really happy he did this on his own and without me having to beg for an explanation or ask for an apology!",15ab2zz,74,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/15ab2zz/facing_rejection/,AnxiousAttachment,1
317,Restlessness and difficulty feeling satisfaction from doing things alone,"Does anyone else experience this? Is this common with anxious attachment?

When I am alone and I have free time to do anything I want, I find that I easily become restless and can't figure out what to do with myself. I have many hobbies, interests, and goals that require alone time, but my motivation to engage with them dwindles and I find myself ruminating about other people (usually my partner).

Eventually, I pick something out and try to do it, but I can't seem to really invest myself in it. Then I leave and pick something else to do, and again, I am not really into whatever I'm doing. It's not always this way, sometimes I manage to settle into doing something, but as soon as that finishes, I'm back into the restless state again.

If I reach out to my partner in that state, it's obvious that I'm just trying to fill the void. It's not satisfying for either of us, and it gives her nothing to desire from the interaction. It feels like talking when there's nothing left to say, it's forced and there's no substance.

I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences this or if they have any insight to share. Thanks.",14k0qww,75,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/14k0qww/restlessness_and_difficulty_feeling_satisfaction/,AnxiousAttachment,1

Then I imagined a situation in the future if I was married to him. Maybe I'm sick or pregnant. Would he meet my needs? No. Would he be able to communicate about issues? no.

If he came back as a friend I'd let him but keep some distance. I've taken him off his shiny throne now and just see him as a person with problems. Saying that I also see that I'm the same. He triggered a lot of things in me that made me anxious. I'm taking a leaf from his tree and reclaiming my space and prioritizing myself.

We were together for 3.5 years, known each other for way longer. It was not an easy decision, at all. I thought about this for a LONG time. And in typical avoidant manner, he was very cool and calm about it and wished me well... then proceeded to block me everywhere 😂

I feel no temptation to reach out. I feel no temptation to stalk his socials. I haven't even checked whether he's online, which is what I expected from myself. I think because I thought about it for a long time, I processed the loss already. All I know is, I feel really calm today. I barely cried when we broke up, which I expected. I'm grateful about this.

323,Breakup but Silver Lining,"My partner of three months and I broke up last night. 

It's hard, but he showed his true colors. Everything felt great for those months and then last week he pulled away and didn't talk to me for four days. 

I totally spiralled, but was able to find support and regulation in friends, therapy and journaling. I didn't take my anxiety out on him. 

That said, when we finally talked, I prioritized my needs. I can't be with someone who completely checks out. He said he needs time to himself and that he got too wrapped in our relationship; that was the first time he shared those feelings and thoughts with me.

It hurts to lose him and what we had, but long-term I think it was the right thing. 

Sharing because.... First, your needs matter. And second, sometimes the conversation around advocating for those needs in a healthy way makes it sound like doing so will always feel positive. In a sense, it does; I am proud of myself. But I'm also sad. 

We can hold that pride and that sadness. And now I have the time and availability to find a partner who can actually meet my needs. Not date me for three months, ghost for four days and then breakup.

324,Awareness Is Nothing Without Action,"I began delving into attachment theory 2 years ago when I started dating someone new &amp;amp; found myself triggered when he went radio silent after a month or so of consistent communication, it was right after our 3rd date--which went really well.  It activated the anxious part of my attachment system &amp;amp; also my deep fears of abandonment rooted in maternal abandonment from my childhood. I ended up agreeing to a no labels/FWB arrangement.  I don't recommend this if you have any anxious tendencies.  I identify as FA with anxious tendencies.

I maintained this connection despite the emotional discomfort at times.  I began viewing it as ""exposure therapy"" &amp;amp; was less affected by his behavior over time, though not completely immune to feelings of anxiety. The relationship was very one-sided &amp;amp; he even admitted he could be selfish. I functioned as a pro bono therapist countless times because the need to be needed is very alluring for me apparently. But I did feel resentful at times, even though I knew I was enabling the behavior.   I refuse to be a victim about it, but also was sick of settling for less than the reciprocity I told him was important in all my friendships. But I \*showed\* him that reciprocity wasn't important by accepting his half-assed, low-effort ""friendship"". And the hot & cold behavior/mixed signals I experienced gave me emotional whiplash!

The reality is I can read all the books/articles, listen to all the podcasts &amp;amp; watch all the videos on attachment theory, trauma-bonding, etc.  But if I keep allowing people in my life who take me for granted or take advantage of my compassionate nature, I'll continue to get the same disappointing &amp;amp; hurtful outcomes. I must **actively choose** to let go of who &amp;amp; what no longer supports the life I want.  Letting go of people, *especially those who are really unhealthy for me*, has always been difficult. I'm codependent AF in that regard, though I've worked really hard to heal my codependency, too.  But I think to truly heal &amp;amp; adopt a more secure style, cutting off contact completely with him is necessary. It's like an alcoholic hanging out in a bar &amp;amp; hoping to stay sober.  So, I'm taking the one day at a time approach, just like someone working toward sobriety.  Sending love to everyone who's dealing with a similar situation.

325,Recovered AP: How I Became Secure While Dating a DA,"Thank you for the kindness and support on my recent post. It wasn't easy sharing my story and I appreciate the encouragement! I promise I will update you all in a few months and let know what life after a toxic relationship is like.

I've been asked how I became secure, especially while in a relationship with a DA given how triggering their behaviours can be to an AP. It has not been easy and my personal experience taught me that true security only comes when you leave the relationship. But of course everyone is different. Below is a list of how I worked on being secure while with a DA.

1. Spending more time alone. Part of the reason why I was constantly triggered in my relationship is because I was around him all the time out of fear of him leaving me or cheating on me if I wasn't with him (activated attachment system). My insistence on always seeing him came from a fear of abandonment but also a control issue; my reasoning was, if I am always with him then he has no time to cheat on me or realise he is better off without me. This was also partly fuelled by how bad he was at reassuring me *even when* I did ask for reassurance. Being away from him was thus very scary and often very difficult. However I started being more deliberate about spending more time alone. And I would sit with my feelings and allow them to wash over me. I felt every bad feeling and faced my mental demons head on. Eventually being alone started to be easier and I started enjoying my own company. I also realised just how much of my own interests and hobbies I was neglecting because I was preoccupied by my relationship. Once I picked up on former interests, time away from him became something I looked forward to. This time alone also gave me the space I needed to think about my relationship and realise just how abusive it was. Which leads me to the second thing.


2. I started writing out my relationship. By this I mean I journalled a lot of the situations that triggered me and all of the times he made me feel bad about myself. This led me to creating an entire map of the relationship from its beginning to the present day. Seeing the dynamic of the relationship written down on paper gave me a new perspective to what I was dealing with... and boy was it bad. I realised that 90% of my time in this relationship was just stress or mental illness. I had more depressive episodes than normal, I had more panic attacks and my self-esteem, especially as it related to my body image, was on the floor. Seeing how badly this relationship was affecting me made me realise that I deserved better. My attitude towards my boyfriend began to change and I was less keen to make effort in the relationship because I knew I would be watering a poisonous plant if I continued trying to be closer to him. Eventually, each time he would push my away, I would accept it. I wouldn't protest, I wouldn't ask him why and I wouldn't panic. I simply accepted it and went to spend time by myself. Journalling helps so much, it's so underrated.


3. Making myself familiar with the secure attachment style. It's very easy as APs to be obsessed with consuming content about DAs. But in doing so, we become fixated on the toxicity of the anxious/avoidant trap that we deny ourselves the opportunity of learning about healthier attachments and bonds. I read the Attached book as I assume most of us have. I watched Thais Gibson and Briana MacWilliams on YouTube. But this time, I did so to educate myself on the behaviours of a securely attached person as opposed to an avoidant person. By learning more about how secure men treat women and how secure people navigate their lives and relationships, I realised I wanted better for myself than what was being offered to me. I no longer had interest in trying to make things work with my DA. I began to desire something completely different. As a result, I created a different vision for my life and what I wanted for my future relationships. My ideal future doesn't involve my partner anymore.

I hope this helps!",ng0r3b,75,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ng0r3b/recovered_ap_how_i_became_secure_while_dating_a_da/,AnxiousAttachment,1
326,I hate dating. Everything I was anxious about came true,"I hate dating. I just got ghosted. I hate when I get triggered because I was right about what went wrong. I was in the “talking stage” with someone for 2 months and had gone on a couple dates. We talked every single day which made me feel secure. I last saw him NYE, but he had plans that night so we parted ways. After that night he started pulling away.

I freaked out. I started analyzing everything I said during our time together. I started wondering if he met someone else. I never told him about any of this. But then he suddenly stopped responding to my messages. After getting ignored for a few days, my anxiety was at an all-time high, and I couldn’t think about anything else. I started obsessively watching over his social media for any signs of what went wrong.

So I double texted and asked if everything was okay. I also asked to let me know if he just didn’t want to date anymore. He said sometimes he just doesn’t feel like talking to anyone, wanted to keep seeing each other, and apologized. But he continued to message and snap me inconsistently after that conversation.

This set me off again, and I went down a social media rabbit hole. Turns out he met someone else on NYE and has probably moved on to her instead. He’s more or less stopped talking to me now but still watches everything I post on social media.

Now I’m just sitting here, embarrassed of my actions and thinking things like “of course he doesn’t want me, look at how you act. She’s probably way cooler and normal and you’d pick her too.” 

I hate this. I don’t feel good enough. 2 months of communication, and he picked someone he met one night. I also wish people could just be honest or upfront, so I don’t get so confused and anxious. Why didn’t he take the out when I gave it to him? Just not feeling great lately.

327,"Left by someone I love because of my AA, I can't stand myself anymore","TW: self harm/ self deprication

The details don't matter but I was recently abandoned and broken up with by someone who had fallen in love with me and vice versa. 

He was the first person I opened up to about my AA and he actually accepted it. He had been through multiple, Countless of my episodes of over texting and over calling and blocking/unblocking and unsendsng messages etc. but he said it would never change how he sees me. Lately it's been rly good and I only had one episode in the last three months. But recently he's been experiencing family health issues and his own mental strife bc of the situation, so he's been distant as hell. He made sure to reassure me super well and explain every detail of why he's been distant. But idk it didn't help this time. 

Well the other week I lashed out again bc I felt extremely anxious at how distant he was that week. and he left me. He wouldn't even talk to say goodbye he just texted to say he was done and refused to talk about if further. 

Anyway, I'm completely in hatred of myself. My AA goes against everything I want to be and all the best parts of myself. I feel like I become a monster when I'm anxious, a completely different person who acts and thinks in ways that my normal self would NEVER. I hate hate hate this part of me. I KNEW he loved me and was going through a lot. Why did this monster have to convince me he hated me? And make me lash out in anxiety?? 


 I've been in therapy for years and although it has helped tremendously my AA still isn't gone completely. I don't curse or say mean things anymore like I did with my first boyfriend 7 years ago anymore. I also limit myself to how much I will text/call them. And when they ask me to leave them alone now I'll actually listen and stop. 

But the monster is still there. And I hate her so effing much. 

This was the last straw for me. I lost the love of my life forever because of this sh*t. I've never been able to hold down a relationship for longer than like 6 months because of this. I'm never going to be in a long  relationship. TW (self harm) : 

I've thought many times about finding ""some way"" to physically remind myself to never speak to my partners when I'm anxious, bc I never learn my lesson. Maybe a tattoo would be enough tho, I was thinking of getting something. 

I'm just so at rock bottom rn and absolutely hate myself. I'm sorry this post is so negative I just need to talk to someone about this. I'm desperate for a solution and to kill this monster in me. 

The monster keeps scaring away everyone I love the most. I feel hopeless and I miss my ex so much.

328,My bf wants us to go on a break and I need help on how to cope,"My bf and I have been having a lot of arguments and issues recently, and so we’ve been struggling and our relationship has been quite exhausting and hard for both of us. I have an anxious attachment style (that I’ve been working on + making progress on), and I would describe my boyfriend as avoidant-leaning but still quite secure usually. 

Because of the exhaustion of our relationship recently my boyfriend said he wants us to go on a break. He described his feelings as numbness towards our relationship, and that he doesn’t have the energy or desire to work on our problems together right now. He hopes that with some space, he can work on himself, and that desire to focus on us will return. 

We had a couple of days of not talking, after which he called me and said he thinks he may need a 1-2 month-long break. And after that, he will reconsider how he feels (if he needs more time, or if he wants to work on things). He says he hopes he will want to work on things, but isn’t sure if that’s where he will land yet. 

This triggered the biggest panics attack / anxious attachment moment I’ve ever felt. I wanted to protest, I kept crying and telling him “I don’t know what to do”. I felt like I was begging him to find another option. I don’t want to break up, but the idea of waiting around for him to see how he feels seems like pure torture to me. 

What can I do in this situation? 🥺 I want to use this time to work on myself. But I don’t know how I can handle the anxiety of not knowing if he wants to come back to me. The day to day anxiety sounds too much to bear. I’m just struggling and losing it right now, please help 🥺",152z6tu,72,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/152z6tu/my_bf_wants_us_to_go_on_a_break_and_i_need_help/,AnxiousAttachment,1
329,A break up guide for my Anxious Folks.,"Hello :) I am going through a break up right now as an AP and i had experiance a lot of heartbreak in the past so i thought i can remember my own coping mechanisms and apply it to my life right now. 

1) Deciding/accepting that it really is over. 

: As a person with abondanment issues. I have this fantasy that they will come back to me and repair everything that is going on inside me. As if even when i am in a relationship with them, i crave that they leave me but they will regret their desicion and be miserable at the end(my care giver abondened me when i was 3) Just accept that it is over. It is a huge relief.

2) Be clear about the reasons why it is over. 

: You are so vulnarable because of this attachment style. You might experiance activation strategies which can make you see your ex as in a higher position than you. You might remember all the good things that happend with them but not the bad ones. Your mind will cling to them as if they were the best thing that happened to you and only you didnt say one time this and that ,relationship would survive but in reality you were never satisfied anyway. Until you feel this way, write every detail that made you miserable in the relationship on notes on your phone. Be very clear and concrate about why this person isnt right for you. The things that made you guys incompatible. When you are in the stage of rose glasses and longing, open your phone and read the things that you wrote. You will see things clearly and move from more logical place.

3) Boundaries

: Your ex can try to return. Be aware of this. My ex(potentially avoidant attacher) tried to come back after ending things out of the blue. Often this person just understands that maybe the they could open their hearts but in reality they are often not look in to their own issues and things will be the same. Dont test the relationship when it is already tested. Remember the huge deal breakers and move on. Set some boundaries for yourself and your heart. This could be No Contact, Blocking, not seeing them. Whatever you need. Remember the point one. Accept that is over.

4) Self Image

: As an AP you might have negative self image. You might feel you are the main reason why this relationship didnt work out. You are always meant to be abondent or unlovable because of your attachment style. First you should stop identifying with Anxious Attachment. You might be in the black holes of attachment theory and why you are always heart broken. This is good to some extent but be mindfull that your self image is not only consists of your attachment style and the problems you experainced because of it. You are not AA. It is just how you attach to people and this can also change. You are much more than AA. What are your good qualities for example ? What are your likes and dislikes ? What are your values in life. There are many other qualities that makes you, you. You might even leave this sub if it triggers you. Try to see yourself as you are , not with your distorted negative self image. Write down your distorted thoughts about yourself such as i am deserved to be abondent and try to see how absurd it is. Try to change that belief. Try to see yourself more realisticly.

5) Coping strategies

:Have some coping strategies when your mind is racing or you are dysregulated. These are meditation, playing and instrument, cooking a nice meal for myself. Meditation helps alot. It gets better with practice and believe me it changes your life. These can differ for you for sure. Try to take good care of yourself. Make a problem list and try to solve everything one by one. Take care of your body and mental well being. Some examples can be to be careful about dehydration or be mindfull about your screen time. 

6) Try to fullfill your life

: As AAs we have the tendency for longing for a relationship. We need to learn to have fullfiling lifes without any romantic partners. We need to have good emotional support. Focus on good friendships. This is also important. Build your own family from friends. What are your need and wants from life? What can you improve today? What can you be excited for ? What are your dreams? The last 3 steps are needed even though you are not going through a breakup. We might have the tendency to abonden ourselfs because of past traumas. Be mindfull of that. Really try to reparent yourself. 


yeah these are my coping strategies. I try my best. I have my own ups and downs. I just wanted to share with you. maybe can help somone. Much love <3",12bb8yi,71,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/12bb8yi/a_break_up_guide_for_my_anxious_folks/,AnxiousAttachment,1
330,I regret giving so much of myself away.,"I hate that I sacrificed so much just to keep the bond. The bond that was barely fulfilling for me, and yet I kept fighting for it to work. He said that he appreciated me putting in so much effort, but I don’t know what I was doing or why I cared so much. I just know he went through so much and I really wanted to help him. But I only ended up giving away my own power and blindly going along and before I knew it, he walked away.

337,Anxious-Avoidant Attachment Relationship Pattern,,fgmwi8,74,12,https://i.redd.it/3fh0yfvudxl41.jpg,AnxiousAttachment,1
338,When attachment doesn't matter,"If someone is cheating, lying, manipulative to where you can see it's intentional, being verbally or physically abusive, ghosts you, not ready for a commitment, etc. You have to walk away. If you're finding it hard to leave, you'll need to lean on whatever community you have to help. Find a support group, therapy, etc. None of these things are a part of being insecurely attached. Everyone does not adapt these completely toxic behaviors simply due to their attachment style and past. Some people experience some of the most horrendous or chaotic childhoods or later traumas. Plenty of these people, you wouldn't even know this about them because of how they've overcome. I have beautiful close friendships with some of these people. I'm also married to an avoidant partner who's beginning to lean secure through our relationship and therapy. Do these people still have things they are still working through? Yes. Absolutely no one is perfect. Not secure, avoidant, anxious, or the hybrid (FA) like me. But I know that I am a kind, thoughtful, nurturing, fun to be around and down to earth human being. I deserve to feel secure with that and to be around people who value those great qualities. Also, those who will be honest if there is ever an issue. Allowing me the chance to grow. 

The study of attachment theory is to give you some insight about yourself and others. It's for awareness and can help navigate disconnects or conflict in committed relationships. Just remember that the power you have to protect yourself is great. Hanging on to toxicity due to thinking someone is so broken that they need you to sacrifice yourself more than the healthy or normal level is only harming you. And how many of you have gone through this before just for things to end and to find out that this person indeed can navigate the world without you just fine?! \*\*Raises both hands!\*\* LOL! You'll never get that time back. It's time to learn, nurture, and build a closer relationship to YOU. You are stuck with yourself no matter who comes and goes for as long as you rise every morning. The greatest amount of love, protection, and grace you can show is for yourself. 

As always, when I post, I'm happy to share resources that have helped me on my journey and tips. And I'd love to hear anyone who's making strides on your journey to secure. <3",16n3jgk,72,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/16n3jgk/when_attachment_doesnt_matter/,AnxiousAttachment,1
339,What are some limiting beliefs that you are currently working through?,"Part of insecure attachment is discovering and healing limiting beliefs that keep us stuck in unhealthy patterns. Finding them can be tricky when we are not aware of our own self talk or the deeper feelings behind our fears and anxiety. Once we find them, we need to come up with a way to reframe them, so as to start to reverse that ingrained belief and create a new healthy one to replace it. That takes time and effort, but the first step is to gain awareness of this belief. Then when it comes up inside of us to recognize that is what it is, and have a way to restate that belief into a healthier one. And keep doing this, every time it comes up. Over time you will find this belief doesn’t come up as often and you start relying on the new healthier belief more automatically. 

So what limiting belief are you currently working through or feel stuck on? What ways are you reframing it?",13du4g1,72,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/13du4g1/what_are_some_limiting_beliefs_that_you_are/,AnxiousAttachment,1
340,DAs just don’t like us that much,"I talked with my therapist a few days ago and usually she is very neutral. However, this time it changed. My DA guy returned ( after 3 weeks of ghosting ) saying that he is sorry and wants to be my friend. He blamed everything on his depression, anxiety, ADHD and ex-gf. I thought, that I could give this ""friendship"" a chance, because he might start wanting to work on himself if he gets to know me better (oh well..). Then my therapist told me the hard truth „but maybe he just doesn’t like you enough to date you“. It hurt like hell, but made me all of a sudden so calm. This never crossed my mind, but damn it’s so true. I know some DAs work on their attachment, if they are either mature enough or just very much in love, but that's not my case. We (anxiously attached folks) have to be realistic and at times even brutally honest, when it comes to toxic relationships, just a reminder.",11gd4da,69,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11gd4da/das_just_dont_like_us_that_much/,AnxiousAttachment,1
341,People are wrong to assume DAs have it easier,"I see a lot of people hold resentment towards DAs because of how they deactivate emotionally and dont really feel the pains of love as much as PAs do. Im a PA who had to deal with DAs before and I understand the sentiment. I used to have it as well.

Now that Im improving through therapy and in a great relationship, I honestly think DAs carry a lot of tragedy with their own attachment style.

My girlfriend for instance, shes secure but leans a bit towards avoidance. So from time to time she may get indifferent towards me which may send me into a spiral. She always thought she was the more rational one in the relationship implying being more emotional as a weakness.

Through therapy, she was able to see that she was acting indifferent because of father issues. She learned to open up, to feel things and man... I feel sad seeing how much pain she was carrying around. Her unconscious mind blocked her from feeling certain things from her childhood and now shes opening up and crying putting all that pain away. Its heartbreaking to see how much she suffered and blocked.

Now, had she not be in therapy and in a relationship with me, she would be blind to it and probably keep repeating the pattern thorought her life. I honestly think she would be fine because shes not that avoidant but still. 

Another girl whom I hooked up with 2 years ago was VERY avoidant and I broke things off in a month. I was 30 at that time and knew very well about AT to know to avoid DAs. 

This girl still checks up my Instagram stories, follows me and then blocks me, from time to time. Without ever saying a word.

I feel like avoidants have moments where they feel their loneliness and desire closeness but arent able to. And cant even realize their issue because its blocked from them

While we PAs articulate, research, seek help, support, try to talk,  write, reach out to our partners... Yeah, we suffer a lot but I also think we grow a lot.

DAs may never heal because most of them will never be aware of their issues. They'll just think their more rational and everyone they dated are too emotional and clingy",wkzzcr,72,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/wkzzcr/people_are_wrong_to_assume_das_have_it_easier/,AnxiousAttachment,1
342,My boyfriend turned out to be Avoidant and I'm almost dealing with it in a secure way,"None of my friends are really anxious attachers so, what seems like normal practice is HUGE and difficult for me. For the first time in my life at 27 I've made some healthy choices in a relationship for once and just felt the need to share.

I've been dating this guy for 5 months, all going well minus a few squabbles over insignificant things. He was very aware that I was anxious and we talked about attachment styles, did some quizzes and he came out as secure. Quids in, or so I thought... He's always been an introvert and we agreed on seeing each other 1-2 times a week because he needs his own space, and he's been mentioning this more recently. I've always complied but it has made me sad because it feels like rejection, even though it isn't.

Anyway, last week was fine, texting every day, got told I was loved and shown verbal and physical affection. Sleepover on Friday, a lovely Saturday morning and then an attempted breakup at Saturday lunch? Very emotionally sat me down and said I was fantastic and wonderful but deserved better and he should die alone as a hermit, that he's going through ""some stuff"" right now and needs to be alone to do it and he doesn't feel ""free"" any more.

I turned around and, while panicked, asked him how long he'd been feeling like this (a week or less, he didn't know) and said that we should take a break for a while and then maybe we can work some things out so he feels less trapped and make sure his needs are met.

And in this break, I haven't texted him once. I am anxious because I don't want to lose him, but for once I haven't sent that long long text, or rang him up. I've talked to my family and friends about my fears, and done some work on analysing if my own needs are being met in this relationship and trying to give myself a sense of that control back. I realise that his pulling away isn't a reflection on my own value or worth. Plus, I've finally taken the step to find a councellor to work on it as I'm just fed up of being anxious and insecure and don't want to be like this anymore.

It may sound small and insignificant but it's a huge step for me and I just wanted to share with some people that might appriciate it.",w4jv5x,73,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/w4jv5x/my_boyfriend_turned_out_to_be_avoidant_and_im/,AnxiousAttachment,1
343,Open letter from the avoidant to the anxiously attached,"> I see your panic. I hear it in your breathing, your sighs, your many signs and gestures—the ones meant to elicit attention from me. I resent you in this mood because it means I lose a partner and gain a child. I become the parent. I become your “fix.” In your panic, my existence is no longer mine. I’m no longer free, whole, separate from you. With nobody in you to meet me, I am trapped and alone.

> Your dependence becomes a weight for me to carry. It’s like a child in you with nowhere to go. Sometimes it feels like an insatiable bully, entitled, demanding I care for it. But it has no sense of time, and I could meet it for hours, resenting you each minute. And nothing changes.

> I want to be loved, not needed.

> Part of me also yearns to be taken care of.

347,Throwing up my own red flags.,"How do you deal with realising you're throwing up.ypur own red flags when dating?
I was triggered in a situation where I was getting to know someone.  Super sweet guy.
We both decided we would be friends. Grow from that.
But I pushed boundaries.  And kissed him.
He didn't stop me but in hindsight (even though he didn't try n vacate LOL after the incident) I was pushing his  boundaries. 
When he went sms silent I was triggered. Sent a pretty blunt text. Basically saying if he wasn't interested to be honest, not ghost me.
The next day I regretted it. I apologised for the text n pushing boundaries. That I still have things from my past I didn't realise I'm still healing from.
He responded. Basically saying we all carry things from our own past. He wasn't sure what he wanted from me. Friendship, more or nothing.
I know hes fearful avoidant.  I knew him years ago n he ran when he was becoming vulnerable.  And he did it again.
This all happened 2 weeks ago.
I sent a message last week just saying I worried about him. And I hoped he wasn't cutting himself off from the world. I left it at that.....

Until last night.  Oh my. I definitely threw up my own red flags. After a few drinks I decided to try calling him. He didn't answer. So...I was triggered.
Let's just say what I sent was beyond embarrassing 😳  and I know if I were him, I wouldn't interact with me ever again.

How the hell do I stop myself being triggered when I feel rejected? I thought I was becoming more secure in my attachment.  But it seems I'm far from it....",15cp2lk,72,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/15cp2lk/throwing_up_my_own_red_flags/,AnxiousAttachment,1
348,Feeling really helpless tonight.,"Feeling super distant from my partner today. Despite exchanging texts here and there throughout the day. Strong feelings of not being good enough are so heavy on my mind the last few days. Does anyone else sometimes feel like there's a canyon separating you and your partner? And there's a bright shiny love on the other side just waiting for you to figure out how to cross the distance? And feeling so helpless and hopeless like the key to figuring it out is so out of reach? And watching it fade like a sunset like you're watching it slowly darken and you'll somehow never see it again? All the work. All the effort feels so useless sometimes. 

Really just felt the need to share this for some reason. I had journaled a version of it a bit ago but it didn't seem to help tonight.

350,Secure scripts:,"Hey gang. A new thing I’ve been doing that has been helping with a lot with AP, is I wrote down a list of “secure scripts” that help kick me out of the AP headspace.

I’ve been learning that a lot of my anxious thoughts come from some core beliefs that are faulty - so these secure scripts sort of short-circuit a lot of the automatic thoughts that come from those core beliefs. Learning is all about repetition, so the more I remind myself of thee regularly, the better!

Anyways, here are the ones I have so far, please share some more if you have any! 

*EDIT: HAH - so I went over these with my therapist and she decided to “edit” them. She said she still doesn’t want me to be mind-reading people. So I added her edits underneath the originals.

- I trust that this person enjoys my company
*EDIT: I have no evidence that this person doesn’t enjoy my company

- This person is happy to hear from me 
*EDIT: I have no evidence that this person is unhappy to hear from me.

- My affections are valuable, and so are my thoughts, questions, feelings, and comments

- Relationships are about connecting with an other - not about fixing myself 

And here are the core relationship scripts of a secure person (found from some scholarly articles):

- if I encounter an obstacle/am distressed, I can approach the other for help
- the other will be available and supportive when I ask for help
- I will experience relief and comfort as a result of proximity with the other

I also have a bunch for texting in particular so I can remind myself how to behave securely. Mind you, these ones are not therapist approved as of yet - but I struggle with texting as it makes me super anxious, and these are the “traits” of a secure texter:

- balanced with initiation
- direct with expressing feelings, asking questions
- often sends follow-up texts after dates
- ⁠prefers to text regularly but not necessarily frequently
- concise with communication and expression
- doesn’t get hung up with over analysis
- takes texts at face-value
- not afraid to ask for clarification or mention when something is bothering them
- most likely one to use emojis and exclamation where they feel it helps express themselves
- can successfully give people their space, as well as knows how to properly communicate when THEY need space.
- tone feels transparent, honest, non-threatening, reassuring. You know where you stand with them!
- ⁠“less and more both have their place, but balance is key!”

351,Feeling good 3 months post break up with DA ex,"Just for any of you APs out there who need a little hope, I want to let you in on my story. My DA partner of 7 years broke up with me in a very brutal way about 3 months ago. Said he had been lying to himself about wanting to marry me (after buying the sapphire I wanted to make my engagement ring) and that he wanted someone who was more ""optimistic and successful"", all this happened just days after placing an offer on a house together (which luckily fell through).

Anyway, I was devastated. I was actually suicidal. I thought no one else would ever want me and I was desperate for him to love me.

For so long even in the relationship I realised I was deeply depressed. My job sucked and I couldn't get a better one. I felt like no one appreciated me. No one seemed to notice me or show any interest in me. I was putting on weight. I tried to audition for roles in theatre (my hobby) and never got anything. It was like everything I did I failed and I gave too much of myself to others but no one gave me much back and I just felt resentful, bitter and alone.

Going NC and discovering attachment theory was the best thing I ever did. I finally started to find myself again and finally started to heal. I began having therapy and working on my boundaries and looking after myself first instead of trying to desperately please others and ignore my own needs. I started to find my own self worth and value. I started to feel SECURE. I can safely say that I feel peace in my heart. For the first time in a long time I actually feel happy alone.

Funnily enough, when I went NC, he started reaching out. Breadcrumbing me with messages that brought back so much anxiety and pain. I realised just how much this relationship had triggered so much stress and depression and how much better off I was without it. If I chose to respond, I tried to always prioritise my own mental health and avoided crossing my boundaries. Eventually he blocked me for no real reason.

Anyway, recently I was stressing because I was going to a mutual friends party and he was going to be there. I convinced myself it would be fine and that I wasn't going to miss out just because of him. I'm glad I went. I had the best time and everyone was super friendly to me despite the breakup. He looked like a mess however and a few people commented how I looked amazing compared to him lol which was nice for the ego to hear. He tried to talk to me a few times in the night and he seemed quite depressed. In fact myself and a few people are genuinely concerned about his mental health as he seems to have isolated himself from a lot of friends and family and I suspect he is having a break down. As much as I still care about him and don't want him to suffer, I've told myself that it is not my responsibility to look after him and I have to put myself first. His friends have agreed to check on him so that helps me push away the guilt that keeps trying to creep up on me. I think though I've come so far and I genuinely don't feel like I want him back. I've realised I deserve better. I want a healthy relationship with someone who's emotionally aware and with a loving, secure attachment. 

Since the breakup, I've felt less anxious, more happy and am enjoying my life filling it with everything I enjoy and all the people that love me. I've tried to stop desperately people pleasing at the expense of myself. I've lost weight, I'm now a lead in a theatre production that I never thought I would get, I got offered a new job AND my old job was so upset to lose me that they made a counter offer to keep me which I thought would never happen. I've made new amazing friends, people are excited to invite me out to fun things, men are suddenly showing interest in me and it's honestly the happiest I've been in so long. It's like as soon as you learn to start loving yourself, everyone else suddenly see's your value too.

Working on your core wounds and becoming secure actually is the best thing you can do. It's like a dominoes effect and everything in life seems to be drawn to your positive energy and gets better. I've realised that how you see yourself is also what you attract and that goes for relationships and life circumstances to a degree.

353,Avoidant/anxious appreciation post,"Hey y’all! 

With all of the vitriol on this sub lately, I just wanted to counter that by sharing that there are so many insightful, empathetic, helpful comments and contributions I see made by folks with avoidant attachment styles (and anxious!) on this sub. 

I deeply appreciate when folks with insecure attachment styles show up here and offer feedback from personal experience. I literally scour Reddit ALL the time looking for nutrient dense content that helps me reflect on the impact of my attachment style and behaviors, and how to grow. 

The emotional labor that avoidant folks do to illuminate/pin point blind spots (specifically, when it’s offered directly and empathetically) has been a VERY valuable part of my growth and processing as an anxious person earning secure.

The growth that I see in anxious folks when they demonstrate their support to others who are earlier on in their journeys (also directly and empathetically), and also those just looking for the pathway to improve also makes me feel really hopeful.

Both perspectives when offered in grace of one another are an invaluable part of this sub. There have been assholes who have been stirring some very unacceptable, abusive shit lately on this sub in the name of attachment styles, and I’m sure it’s been activating for all of us. While this is being resolved, I just wanted to say that we’re not each others enemies. I deeply understand and empathize with how these folks' behavior might confirm our fears and assumptions about one another, or even trigger past experiences. Their behavior is meant to be divisive.

I want to advocate for a kinder space and just remind folks, even those who are struggling with being hurt by anyone on the spectrum of insecure attachment styles, that this space can be, and has been used better than the way it's been co-opted by this individual/these individuals. Their abuse and personal issues do not represent us. When we’re collaborating respectfully, this sub has some incredible power to inform and transform those who are looking to grow and trying to do better.

Sending y’all love.",z6ckz1,70,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/z6ckz1/avoidantanxious_appreciation_post/,AnxiousAttachment,1
354,Why it’s so important to stop looking for validation from your partner or other external sources,"I am an FA, but lean very anxious when partnered with another FA or DA. Even though I receive compliments all the time from my FA ex, my friends, my family, I fail to internalize them. I constantly need and love it when people tell me I’m beautiful or smart or successful. Yet, I still manage to think, why am I not good enough for so-and-so to commit to me? Why won’t he plant his flag, why doesn’t he want to brag to the world that he’s with me?

Thanks to therapy, tons of AT reading, and hard work, I’m finally starting to find that validation in myself. But it is so fucking hard. Today I received an intro on an OLD platform from a younger man that I wouldn’t personally date. But it was long, detailed, and absolutely gushing with praise for so many things about me. He told me he would marry me on the spot if he could. It was one of the sweetest things I’ve read in a really long time. And even after all my hard work, the first thing I thought of at the end of it was, why couldn’t my FA ex see all of that and take me off the market? I legit ugly cried for a good 10 minutes.

But then after I calmed down, I reminded myself that my FA ex *did* see all of that. How could he be the only person who didn’t? How could he be the *only person* in my orbit who doesn’t love me? That’s when the lightbulb blinked on and I was able to remind myself yet again that his inability to commit has absolutely nothing to do with me. Nothing. NOTHING.

Their deactivation, distancing, rejection, hot and cold behavior, 99% has nothing to do with you. It is all fear. Fear derived from childhood trauma that they have no fault in and no control over. Fear that you’re too good, that they’re not good enough. Have compassion for them, but more importantly, have compassion for yourself. This post is just as much for me as it is for anybody else who it might help.

355,"Stop trying to fix things, stop holding them back in your life, if they want to walk let them walk....","As I kinda become more self aware, I realise the little things I do as an anxious attached....

Trying to maintain ""peace and harmony"", for some imaginary greater good, but at the cost of my emotions, self esteem and wellbeing.

We hold on to people, thinking... 
Ok FWB it is, it's fine, at least they are still in my life right? 
Ok friends, it's fine, they can find someone else, I ll be happy for them, at least they are still on my life right? 

I feel so much shame, of what I put myself through, for people who would not put much thought for me. 

I do miss some people, the people I have to let go, because I feel like I am hanging on, because I am afraid to let go... The abandonment and loneliness to come. 

I need to be strong, some friends are not meant to be, some relationships are not meant to last. I think I can linger on as a ""good friend' for them... but to them... I might just be someone they just be polite with, and hope I bugger off on my own. 

Accept the shame, I am going to be a better person.

I am trying to find ways that I can stay neutral when stress is high instead of absorbing others emotions. A way that my anxious attachments plays out is when a relationship gets turbulent, I have a hard time refraining from trying to fix everything and I suffer and stay miserable until there is a resolution of some kind to ease the pain. I'm sick of letting myself suffer in this way! I'm guessing it's from not feeling in control?

Every time I've begun reciprocating their enthusiasm and eventually returned their attraction they just close up entirely and stop talking about themselves.

359,Started seeing a secure person after being dumped by an FA. It's night and day,"4 months post breakup and I've started seeing this really nice woman. It just cemented attachment theory for me. I also realized it's very important to vet people you date.

#- How we met:

- Approached her in the street. She was waiting for her cab. Had a 10 minutes conversation and I grabbed her phone number.

- She was very sweet and communicative and agreed to go on a date.

- On the date, she was communicative. She was not afraid of talking about the future and what she wanted. 

- She comes from a very healthy family. Parents are still together etc. 

- In between dates, she's communicative. Again, not afraid of being vulnerable. 

- Things are moving very slow. There's no rush. No anxiety on my side. It feels ""normal""


#- How I feel: 

- No anxiety whatsoever 

- I feel comfortable talking about what I want and she's willing to discuss and talk about it

- She's consistent. I don't have to guess ""is she going to bail?"" ""is she going to stop seeing me?""

360,Me and my avoidant bf broke up and I feel so free,"I was gathering the courage to break up with him for a few days already but he always did something to lure me back in. He was breadcrumbing me because he felt I was getting distant until he was the one who broke up with me. I’m not mad at him, I actually don’t feel anything towards him. I’m mad at myself for entertaining his behaviour for so long. He told me he was aware of how he was treating me and “apologized” for it. He didn’t seem aware of it while we were together and while I was begging him to give me a bare minimum, he’d say “I’m not an emotional guy it doesn’t mean I don’t love you”. He never apologized for anything for the whole year we were together and there were many things he should’ve apologized for. I cried for two hours and then picked myself up. This guy didn’t even have decency to break up with me in person but he did it over text. Hanging out once a week was apparently still too much for him. 

Please, I’m begging you, don’t let anyone treat you like this. He drained my energy and used me because he knew I had a soft spot for him. I feel so free now knowing I will never have to worry about him texting me differently than he did yesterday again, will never have to guess if he’s in a good mood or not and if he still has feelings for me.",sbxo1x,69,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/sbxo1x/me_and_my_avoidant_bf_broke_up_and_i_feel_so_free/,AnxiousAttachment,1
361,Ways I've been healing,"I wanted to share some ways I’ve been trying to heal my anxious attachment style for the past month since my break-up which is what motivated me to change. I see a lot of people talking about how important it is to work on themselves and to heal, but I see very little about how to actually do it. I hope this helps and I would love for you to share how you’ve been healing! This is just how I’ve been doing it and it’s totally okay if you’re doing it another way.

1. Therapy – I started going to therapy about a week after the break-up and it’s been great to talk to an unbiased person about the relationship. We’ve been focusing on self-love activities.
2. Creating a morning routine – This one is newer and I’ve just started this week. I have a tendency to get straight out of bed and rush out of the house. Having a morning routine helps me have a more mindful morning. I’ve been making tea and coloring in a coloring book.
3. Affirmations – Every morning I’ve been playing a video with self-love affirmations and I repeat each one to myself.
4. Meditation and Yoga – Trying to do this every day!
5. Educating myself – I’ve been reading a lot of books and watching videos about attachment styles and codependency, so I’m aware of my patterns. I’m debating if I wanted to sign up for Personal Development School.
6. Sleep meditations – I randomly stumbled into this while looking for a regular meditation. Basically, you play the video while you sleep so it reprograms your subconscious
7. Emotion code – I stumbled onto this one on TikTok. It’s the idea that negative emotions can get trapped in your body when you don’t process them fully. It uses muscle testing to ask your subconscious what the emotions are, then you use a magnet to release the energy.
8. Inner child – This is based on a post I saw on here. I set a timer for every hour in the day and at the top of the hour I will check in with my inner child. Ask her if she needs anything, remind her how much I love her, and tell her how I will always be there for her.
9. Nature – I do fieldwork like 3 times a week, so I’m outside for work. But when I’m not doing fieldwork, I try to go on walks around the neighborhood or at the park.
10. Feeling my feelings – I mostly get triggered while I’m in a relationship and not so much now that it has ended, so I haven’t put this to the test yet. But I’ve been practicing with smaller feelings, so hopefully, I will be prepared! I learned to feel your feelings, you have to stop your thoughts and try to feel where the tension is in your body.
11. Journaling – personally I don’t have much motivation to journal unless I’m really triggered, so this isn’t a daily habit for me. But I do gratitude journal where I wrote a good thing that happens each day.",r9z9av,67,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/r9z9av/ways_ive_been_healing/,AnxiousAttachment,1

It is a VERY uncomfortable physical sensation in my body. It feels like the room is getting smaller, there is nobody in the world but me, and I am EXTREMELY alone. Feels like I’m dying, in a sense. All of this will happen over someone I’m not even “official” with, I just happen to like them.

Both friends and myself highly suspect that I have ADHD, so I’m not sure if it’s anxious attachment style or a symptom of ADHD, perhaps both? Does anyone else get this? Is there a name for it? How do you self-soothe and work past this/prevent it from happening so often?

364,"I directly asked for my needs to be met, and it worked!!","I am an FA who has lately been full-on anxious with the person I'm seeing (secure). We've been seeing each other for almost three months and taking it pretty slow in terms of labels, since we're in our 30s and want to make sure it feels right for both of us. This is totally new for me, as someone who used to jump into relationships with people before even knowing if they're right for me. Initially, as an FA, I was avoidant (in my head, anyway—trying to find faults in my partner without expressing them because I knew it was a deactivating strategy and wasn't real), but then as we started to become more comfortable with each other and this person stopped sending quite so much affection via text, I swung over to anxious.

This person is clearly still into me, and I definitely know it when we're in person, but he has to travel for his job, and even though he texts regularly and often, alarm bells keep going off in my head thinking he's not interested, purely because the texts aren't particularly flirty. I've been thinking this is ridiculous of me and trying to push these fears down. But after finishing the book Attached, I finally decided to talk to him about it. I asked if we could talk on the phone, and he said ""yeah, let me call you in five minutes and we can talk while I'm on my run!"" (Should be an indicator that he's into me, lol.)

He has read Attached, so I nervously told him that I know it's silly, but I finished the book and that what I need is more reassurance that he's still into me, particularly via text. He said that it's not silly at all, but he needs more clarification because he thought he was doing that. I told him he probably is, and that it's not that he is doing anything wrong at all, but that at this stage while I'm in therapy and trying to get to secure attachment, and while we're still in the beginning stages, I need more. He completely understood and was happy I told him, and this morning he texted me, ""Good morning, beautiful!"" Just wanted to tell y'all about this win for anyone who's scared that expressing their needs will blow up their relationship!

TL;DR: I asked the secure person I'm seeing for more reassurance, even though I was terrified to do it, and he was happy to meet my needs :)",xe285z,68,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/xe285z/i_directly_asked_for_my_needs_to_be_met_and_it/,AnxiousAttachment,1

I’m loyal, accountable, stand up for myself, have empathy, integrity and character. All goes wacked when I’m met with the opposition. 
Fuck that shit! I know myself, have done the work and bam if it doesn’t come alive when I feel not heard, unseen, dismissed and the list goes on. 

Beginning to think there is a graveyard of fucked up people out there who blindly go through life without self awareness and the self aware get dragged into a lower emotional state with these people once a connection forms. 
Then left with wtf just happened!! 

Wake the fuck up you lower emotionally unintelligent people! stay the fuck away from people if you’re just going to be an adult with fucking diapers on!

Added: I am adding this in because it seems my anger means I did not have empathy. Not true at all. 
I had tons of empathy for this person. I know the issues on their side. But if they can’t or won’t see it, it’s not  my job to keep pointing it out, To try and get them to see. This was very sad and they were upset, crying and promising change multiple times when I tried to leave the relationship because it was not good for me because of things they did not just their attachment style. I tried to work it out but was doing most of the work. 

Once I accepted and agreed to work on it because of my empathy towards them, because I was working on myself, because I was self-aware, this person would continue with inconsistency and knew it was hurting me.  I did not want to deal with anymore as the anxiety was hurting me, andI have that right to leave. It by no means means I did not care or love this person so please stop the bashing.

- It is not demanding to be open about what I need
- It takes two to make or break a relationship
- I love myself no matter what other people think of me

368,Finally walking away,"I have put every piece of my energy and life into loving and trying with my DA. But it truly felt like nothing I did ever got through to him. There was an invisible iron barrier around him. It stopped him ever getting too close. He was so stubborn, he never listened, he never tried, he never saw anyone else's pov. Not just with me. He barely had any friends because he would argue with them. When he was mad he was so cold and cruel, his heart just turned to pure ice. He once told me, and I think this is the most true thing he ever said 'I am myself. I can't change, I will not change. I am just this way'. 

He truly believed it was impossible for people to change. I think this was to make himself feel better that he was afraid to try. I loved him with every inch of my body and heart. Because he was smart, clever, capable and somewhere in there I saw a person desperate to be accepted. He couldn't trust others, he couldn't understand others and most of all he couldn't love others.

But I won't do it anymore. The gaslighting, the push and pull, the abandonment, the running. It's not worth it for a 5 minute rush of brain chemicals everytime he remembered I existed. The constant anxiety and worthlessness isn't worth it. Everytime I go crawling back into the cycle it let's him know he can continue running and I'll always be here. Well this time I'm going to be the one with the courage to leave. And he won't chase me, he won't even care most likely.

372,I think the book 'attached' gives the worst advice to AP's.,"
I read a big chunk of the book not that long ago and I was obviously reading it mainly to see what they said about what each type should do about their problem but I was really surprised at the advice they gave especially to AP's. Their advice is to just find someone who wants to love you the way you want to be loved. I kept reading on thinking they are going to mention some things the types could do to help themselves be less anxious,be less obsessive or heal easier or meet their own needs during the early parts of getting know a love interest but they didn't get into detail about anything else you can do if I remember correctly. I'm 90% sure they pretty much left it there or they didn't elaborate much on other advice. 

The problem I have with their advice is that this mindset might be very damaging to AP's more than the other types because most people will find it burdensome to meet the AP's needs for affection. And they might be turned off and leave as well.

And AP's who haven't healed usually end up losing feelings for someone who meets their needs in a relationship. So it's unrealistic and lazy to think that you should just focus on finding a very loving partner and everything else will fall into place. 


Also I've been thinking about the type of person who can meet the AP's needs and I think it would have to be a very rare type of person. Someone very patient and understanding who is also fine with having a clingy partner for some time maybe because they have been starving for affection themselves. I find it hard to believe this person is trauma free. They've probably been through their own problems with attachment and a dysfunctional upbringing.


The book really disappointed me and the high ratings it has baffles me. It seems carelessly put together in many parts of the chapters.

373,Taking your DA/FA off of the pedestal,"I’ve been talking to my therapist about taking a recent FA ex off of the pedestal that he’s been on for the entire duration of our relationship. I’m realizing that more than being in love, I was in love with the potential that our relationship had. He was a great person- charismatic, charming, successful, handsome, and kind. And yet he was still an absent partner that didn’t meet my needs at all. 

It’s been helpful to actually remind myself of those negative truths. I wasn’t happy. He wasn’t a good boyfriend. I was lonely. 

My therapist also told me that all of those qualities that I admire in him are present in me, but I can’t seem to acknowledge or see them. I’m slowly learning to take him (or any future partner) off of the pedestal and put myself up there. Does anyone else with anxious attachment struggle so hard with seeing their own worth? 

I’ve also been struggling with no contact with my ex, but I came to a realization that has helped with that too. Whenever I want to reach out, it’s when I’m really low & lonely. In those moments when I want to reach out, or have reached out, I’m still looking for HIM to make me feel better. I’m still falling into that same dynamic! I will never feel better until I can provide that safety for myself. i don’t know if that helps anyone else, but it’s kept me from reaching out a few times. The only way to get to the other side (security) is sitting with the uncomfy feelings that come from being alone.",xabjj2,68,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/xabjj2/taking_your_dafa_off_of_the_pedestal/,AnxiousAttachment,1
374,My journey from secure to anxious to (mostly) secure,"Many years ago, I was in my first relationship and was totally secure. I was naive and had rose colored glasses firmly on: my ex was such a great person, he would never lie or cheat, he would communicate any problems I would have trusted him with my life. I was never anxious or mistrustful or suspicious... To the point that I completely failed to realise that he was cheating on me right under my nose.

The relationship ended in an abrupt and traumatic way after 9 years, and this caused the collapse of a lot of my certainties about myself, him, people in general, my self esteem. I was a traumatised wreck. I ended up straight with a narcissist whose psychological abuse destroyed what little was left and when I emerged, I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, and my attachment had turned 200% anxious.

A couple more terrible relationships followed, including an outright abusive one, where I followed the anxious attachment pattern to a T. No matter how much I tried to rebuild my confidence and self esteem, the hot/cold behavior in a bad relationship reactivated the anxiety and my self esteem was destroyed again. All I did was blame myself and think it was yet another proof that I was unlovable and a worthless person.

I also put up with awful situations much longer than I should have because I didn't have the confidence to tell whether they were really bad or whether I was just ""making a big deal"" because of my anxiety. And I was so desperate to get love, & thus validation, that I stuck around trying to ""prove"" I was lovable. 

Then a year ago I discovered attachment theory and figured out what I was dealing with. I started therapy (not specifically for that, but it was also addressed). Awareness of my unconscious anxious patterns changed everything. I had a few short dating experiences and every time I found myself reacting more rationally, identifying the irrational anxiety and being able to distinguish between what was actually not working and what was my anxious attachment getting activated. I still struggled to walk away when I identified an unsuitable situation, but at least I was aware of what I was doing.

Cue six months ago, I got involved with someone who I now realise is extremely avoidant (in love, in life, in everything: his life is a mess) but at the time seemed to me just very reserved and a bit moody. I wasn't familiar with avoidant attatchment so I totally failed to recognise it (he said things he could have read out loud from any article about avoidant attatchment, but I didn't know).

And... I barely even noticed.

What I mean is: you know the hot/cold, sudden disappearing acts that a year ago would have turned me into a clingy wreck of anxiety spikes? I was so busy doing my own thing I just thought, oh he's in a mood again, he'll be back eventually. I was happy to let him have all the space in the world as I wanted my space too and enjoyed it when we came together. He asked for more space once and from then on, I was always very mindful of it and we even devised a system using a colorful towel to signal when he wanted alone time (we lived in nearby bungalows on an island). I just accepted it was hia baseline and felt well matched in terms of independence. I actually thought we were in a healthy secure relationship most of the time, barring a couple of occasions when his neglect turned outright disrespectful - but I communicated firmly because I now have the confidence to think my needs are valid, even though some people have less needs than me. he apologised, we moved on, he actually did better. 

I actually swung so far in the opposite direction from my habit of taking everything personally out of insecurity, that I thought his mood & behavioural swings had nothing to do with me and that his affection for me was constant and secure even though he couldn't always express it. I still fell into the trap that sometimes, when his behaviour was actually a red flag that made me feel anxious, I chalked it up to my anxious tendencies and glossed over it... Mostly. I still took notice that something that makes me anxious is not good. 

The downside is that I was completely blindsided when two weeks ago he broke things off out of the blue freaking out about commitment and future plans, saying he didn't actually have feelings for me and didn't care about seeing me again, relationships trigger him etc. We had been peacefully cuddling and smiling all of 2 hours earlier and I thought all was well. It was quite a shock. 

Even so, I wasn't traumatised and devastated and wrecked with self loathing the way I would have been in the past. I was upset of course, and it hurts to think he didn't care for me the way I thought, but I analysed the situation, reviewed his past behaviour and after learning about avoidant attachment, put it all in perspective and now it makes sense. 

I did my best and ultimately if he doesn't enjoy my company and doesn't love me, there's nothing more to discuss. I politely declined his offer to be friends and haven't reached out since. I still feel a bit angry as it seems like he used me as a pastime till the end knowing he didn't really have feelings and was about to ditch me, but I don't actually think he's a malicious person. I knew the practical ramifications of his ""odd"" behaviour made it unsuitable to pursue a long term relationship with him, so even though I was willing to try if the feelings were there, it makes it somewhat easier to get closure.

A year ago this would have destroyed me emotionally. I was frankly surprised at how rationally I handled it and how quickly I'm moving on this time. I'm not blaming myself, nor him personally - I see the issue for what it is. I almost keep expecting the anxiety and desperation to show up any time, I'm so used to it. I'm sad of course as I cared for him deeply and miss his company that I genuinely enjoyed. But it's not devastating and foundation-wrecking. My foundation is solid.

It just feels like such a tremendous goal I hadn't even realised I'd reached. Here's hoping I can continue on this path.",rtoulm,65,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/rtoulm/my_journey_from_secure_to_anxious_to_mostly_secure/,AnxiousAttachment,1
375,I can’t move on from someone until I am emotionally invested in someone else,"
It’s so weird and I hate it. I get obsessed w people very quickly which is why I end up falling for people who don’t have my same intentions/needs. But I also can’t just let go of these people until I start to talk to someone else and eventually become invested in them. After that happens, I’ll eventually forget the past person and talk to them less and less until I don’t care about them anymore. It’s unhealthy. Like why can’t I just be alone. 


Also- I am alone. I’m never in actual relationships w these people. We just text every day. I’m sure some of them don’t even know I like them more than they like me, mostly Bc I act nonchalant just like they do. I also don’t even know if these “obsessions” are even true feelings or just another way to temporarily distract myself from my emotional needs.

377,My DA partner has lost all my respect. I've decided to end things. How do I even start this conversation?,"We have been together for two years. He is DA and I am currently secure leaning anxious. I entered the relationship with my predominant attachment style being secure with a few anxious tendencies. But when his full DA nature came out, this turned me into predominantly an AP. It was the typical case of having a wonderful honeymoon phase for 5 or 6 months before the committment became reality and his DA nature came into full swing. There have been many ups and downs and I have experienced a level of stress and suffering that I never experienced in my life before. It's taken a lot of work, discipline and therapy to heal myself and learn to be secure again. I even wrote a post talking about how avoidant I feel now because of it.

However, I've realised in the last couple of weeks that, while I'm indeed becoming more secure, my avoidant feelings are actually related to me no longer enjoying the relationship anymore. He's still very much DA. The only difference is I am less affected by it because I am focusing on myself. However, this is not sustainable in the long run. Regardless of how secure I am becoming, I can't fully heal if I am constantly confronted by my triggers. I hate being with someone who constantly makes me feel disposable or like I don't matter. I found the book Attached and I can relate to the Craig and Marsha except for some details.

The final straw? Despite months of talking about living together and starting a family one day, he announced to me that he is thinking of getting a house for himself. The kicker? He even suggested that he would rent out an extra room to save money on living costs. Yes, let that sink in.

The man I was planning a future with surprised me by saying he wants to buy a house on his own and have SOMEONE ELSE live there. Completely disregarding any and all future plans. However, instead of protesting, I just feigned support and encouraged this idea. I even went on a few housing websites and sent him some nice houses he would like (I did this on purpose to prevent a protest behaviour). He obviously got suspicious as he was expecting me to be upset and he asked if I was okay with his plan. I was honest and told him I was very shocked with how he handled it and I expected he would have included me in the matter but it's ultimately his choice and I will support any decision he makes. We had a minor argument but I let him win that one and since then I have been distant with him. I've lost all respect. I've got nothing to say anymore. He's put me off completely. I'm a woman but if I was a man, I would describe this a total boner kill.

I'm going to end things in a couple of days. How do I even start this conversation? What do I say? I suspect he might immediately stonewall and show apathy towards me as I read that's how DAs handle these situations most times (if they're not the dumper). But this is the first time I'm actually going to be breaking up with him. So I don't know how to go about it. Anyone with any experience?

Side note (and yes, I know APs can be toxic too):

Sorry to be negative or judgemental but this experience has taught me that dating a DA is not worth it at all. I understand that they are hurting too. I understand they too are suffering from insecure attachment. But honestly, that does not excuse or justify the complete disregard they demonstrate towards the emotional and physical well being of their partners. Honestly, the anxious-avoidant dance is *emotionally abusive*. In the two years we have been together, I've never experienced such negative feelings in my life. He made me feel so disposable, like I was nothing. He made me question my sanity, and my self-esteem at some point died.
Despite my healing, I know I will be dealing with the trauma of this emotionally abusive relationship for a long time and I will have to go back to therapy.

378,If you love jumping to the worst scenario this is for you..,"I just typed most of this in a reply to another post but decided it deserved its own post.

For those who can’t help but catastrophize and jump to the worst case scenario, I absolutely relate to you, and this is for you:

When people are trying to help they’ll probably say things like, don’t worry, you’re jumping to the worst case scenario, meditate and occupy yourself. And they are absolutely right, you are probably jumping to the absolute worst case scenario while there is no reason to think so! And meditating and occupying yourself and doing breath work can help you momentarily calm down and not spiral into a state of panic. Especially, if there is no factual/tangible reason to do so, except your triggered core wounds. 

However, these are temporary solutions. And I have something better for you. Think of the absolute worst case scenario. Your partner is indeed cheating on you. They will indeed leave you. They indeed moved on and chose someone else. They refuse to apologize or give your relationship a second shot, etc. Will it be absolutely devastating and crushing and break your heart into little pieces? Yes. But so would losing a parent or getting in an accident or filing for bankruptcy... Will you be able to survive, and put the pieces back together, and find joy without that person? ALSO YES.

I’m not saying this to invalidate anyone’s feelings. Trust me I have felt, and still feel immense anxiety and pain regarding relationships. However, this switch in mentality can be really helpful.
What I think AP people need to do more, is not just avoid catastrophizing, but know that even if things go really really bad, you can still survive. We are no longer helpless children that need the adults that abandoned them. We are adults ourselves, and we can work on healing ourselves, and meeting our own needs, and occupying ourselves, and leading healthy happy lives by ourselves, and with other adults. And just because it doesn’t work out with one person, doesn’t mean that it won’t with the next. This mentality will really help you long-term! 

We are stronger then we think we are! We need to build ourselves, and our self-esteem, and enrich our lives with things and people that add joy!

379,going to break up with situationship and it hurts so much,"Hi guys, this is going to be long. But everyone in this community is so supportive, I really just want to write out what I've been going through for catharsis and to start healing. 

Basically I (23F) had a very intense two-month fling with a guy (28M) I met on a summer programme - at first it was casual, but by the end we were spending every night together, most hours of the day together, and we fell pretty hard for each other. He's a wonderful, charismatic person and we had so many things and values in common. I knew from the start he was in an open relationship with another girl, but because I thought I could keep it casual, I didn't care. Probably should also mention that he was my first everything - first kiss, first time having sex, first relationship etc. 

At the end of the two months we discussed what we wanted from the relationship - I didn't want to lose him, so I agreed to try out polyamory with him, because we loved and still wanted to see each other. This didn't work and I found myself tossing and turning in bed sick with anxiety as he went on holiday with his other girlfriend the next month. I decided I couldn't do it any longer and told him that this was really hurting me, I wanted a proper exclusive relationship with him and if not then I would have to leave. I was fully prepared to break up there and then, but surprisingly he said he could see a relationship with me - he just needed time to think about it. Fair enough. 

We kept texting and calling and I was feeling comfortable with it all. 

But I went through a pretty tough situation (losing my passport while overseas, being quarantined etc.) and didn't feel like I could rely on him for emotional support at the time. I'd previously told him that I wanted him to text more, and he was making an effort to do so, but it was still only texting 1-2 times a day which I wasn't really satisfied with. While I was in quarantine I kept trying to pin him down to have a call and iron things out, but he kept saying he was busy and would call later, but then never did. Previously, he'd always called when he promised he would so this felt like a big betrayal of trust. Things came to a head yesterday when I messaged him that I was really hurt that he wasn't taking this as seriously as I was, and that I wasn't important enough to make time for. We talked a bit, he said he was aware we had differences in communication needs and he wanted to consider a relationship only if we were happy with each other's expectations. I said okay, we'll talk tomorrow, no matter what happens I love you, okay? And he never replied. That was a big trigger for me, and I wasn't able to sleep the whole night. 

So I think I'm going to end it today when he calls. Even if he ""chooses"" me, I don't think he's going to be emotionally available or supportive - he's a great guy, and I love when we spend time together, but I don't think he's willing to commit or invest. And I'm tired of being the only one putting in effort to sustain our relationship. I just love him so much though, and the thought of losing him hurts so much. But I know this is what I'll have to do to protect myself. I want someone who wants to text and call me as much as I want to, someone who isn't forced to do things with/for me, someone as ""obsessed"" with me as I am. I don't know if I'll ever find that person, but I don't think I'll find it with him. And I'll just have to make peace with that. He's a lovely person, but I guess we're just not right for each other, and that hurts so much. I don't know if other people can relate to this whole situation but I just want it to stop hurting. The anxiety waiting for him to call is killing me as well. 

Before this relationship, I was so happy being with myself, I never wanted a relationship, I have a thriving social circle and family who love me - but why does it feel like that's no longer enough? I'm afraid of the person I've become who has become so weakened by love. I wonder if I'll ever get back to that healthy state of mind and be able to be happy with just myself and my goals again. I want to stop hoping that things with him will work out, and be able to let him go gracefully. I want to stop constantly second-guessing myself and blaming everything on my anxious attachment, and I want to put my own needs first. 

Thanks for listening reddit, I know this got really long and painful, but I just had to have it all out. I'll update later once I've broken up with him.

Update: I did it. I broke up with him. I laid out my needs (daily call, texting often etc) and he said for him phone and video calls don't build intimacy, he feels like he can only build that from in-person connections. So he can't give me what I need. But he was very apologetic for having hurt me, and I think that gave me some closure at least. I'm trying not to villainise him and to empathise with him, because I don't think he's a bad person. I almost wish he was, because if that's the case, things would be easier I think - but at the moment it's so fucking hard. I can't sleep (again) and am just desperately hoping things will get better. Thank you everyone for your overwhelmingly positive support, I know I have things to work on which I will be going through in therapy, but also I've stopped second-guessing myself and have realised that this relationship just wasn't the right one for me. I love you all and I'm so touched that you've extended so much love and care to me. I hope - no, I know things will get better, and that I'm strong, and I'll make it through this. I deserve the best, and I'm going to get it if it's meant to happen.",16eu2lw,66,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/16eu2lw/going_to_break_up_with_situationship_and_it_hurts/,AnxiousAttachment,1
380,Texting: people with avoidant & anxious attachment styles text more. Secure people tend to text less.,"https://www.lifehack.org/418652/how-your-texting-habit-reveals-your-personality

What I gathered from the article:

-anxious attachment styles text a LOT for obvious reasons. 

-people with avoidant attachment text a lot because it’s a means of maintaining control over the degree of intimacy; unlike in-person communications, they can simply not reply if they don’t want to. 

-secure attachment styles text less, but consistently: they don’t view texting as a way of reminding/being reminded that you care for and love them, because those aren’t things they think need clarified.

From experience —

I’ve been seeing a secure guy. Often we are told infrequent texting is a sign of avoidance, but this article really makes me feel otherwise. I used to lose my shit because the guy I’ve been with would only text me 4-5 messages a day; I addressed this and it has been 10-20 more meaningful emotional texts a day (he is noticeably trying). What matters to secure attachment styles isn’t frequency, it’s CONSISTENCY. They might not text you throughout the day, but they will text you everyday. But think: to them, there is literally no reason not texting every detail of your day would be a problem. They know they like you. They know you like them. 

That being said… talk to your partner. If they’re avoidant, they’ll run. If they’re secure, they’ll try harder.",zx3rvg,67,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/zx3rvg/texting_people_with_avoidant_anxious_attachment/,AnxiousAttachment,1

387,Break up with avoidant after 4 years,"Hello! I am going through an extremely painful breakup and I could use support. If you have been through something like this and have space to read this and share words of encouragement or hope that would mean a lot to me. Thank you so much. 

I have anxious attachment. He has avoidant. We were together 4 years. We were truly family. We were best friends. 

For the last year of our relationship I was doing extremely brave work or changing my anxious attachment style. This was hard with my avoidant partner but I had a great trauma therapist and I worked my ASS OFF to challenge all my anxious behaviors and become more secure. My partner and I went to counseling for a little while to unlearn the push pull dynamic. There was a lot of focus on my attachment style but his didn’t come up as much which is foreshadowing. Eventually we got to a good place and stopped going. 

Through this time I realized that I needed to move to a new city. I feel I’ve outgrown where we live. My Avoidant partner agreed to moving away together and we also planned to get married. This was the plan for a full year and everything was set up. This plan felt like the light at the end of the tunnel for me. All of my hard work will finally pay off and I will be married to my best friend of 4 years and starting over in an exciting new city! However, My gut told me that avoidant partner didn’t really want to do this. He was always extremely resistant to every single big step on our relationship. He never initiated talks about getting married or moving. I did all the work myself in planning. I asked for reassurance that he was all in. He swore that he was all in. I felt ashamed and crazy for doubting him after doing all of my attachment work. We bought plane tickets to go look at homes in the new city. 2 weeks out from the trip we started getting into push pull fights. *I realized that we never spent time on his attachment style in therapy and as a result I was doing all of the work to be secure.* I shared an article on the anxious avoidant trap in hopes of finding ways to better be on eachothers teams. We agreed that it will take a lot of work for us to stay together and change our attachment styles but that it was worth it because we wanted to be together and also we wanted to be secure and healthy individuals. He promised me that he was all in. I believed him. 

Fast forward to the week of the trip:
I come home. He’s been drunk for 24 hours which is not normal. He’s vomited all over the house. Which is not normal. I see that he’s pretending to sleep. Which is not normal. He finally gets up to clean his vomit. He wont look at me. I ask him over and over and over and over and over what’s going on. He won’t look at me he ignores me. Finally after asking “are you breaking up with me” like 10 times he says “yes” I say why and he says “the push pull dynamic is too much and I can’t commit to a future with you.”

Then he ghosted me. Just like that. Hes gone. 4 years of family level partnership and now we are strangers. Im in so much pain all the time.

388,Big realization on FA + DA,"I thought I was FA/AP. I thought I was meant to be with my extremely unaware DA partner. So I analyzed, I read, I talked, I wrote, and I spent a LOT of time overthinking this whole situationship. Of course, it didn't work.

Now, a few months later, I am dating a pretty secure guy (with maaaybe a little DA tendencies, but nothing compared to my previous SO). And my god, the world is different. I feel zero anxiety. I don't care if I don't hear him all day. I don't have to guess if he likes me, I know he does.

And now I see what I had been doing to myself before. How much effort I put in a relationship that only one of us (me) really wanted. And how easy it can be with someone who has a secure attachment style. I also realized that what I thought was 'being extremely in love' was actually 'being anxious all the time'. Of course the good moments felt sooo much better, because they were rare, and I had to fight for them, and I knew I might never get them again. It was not healthy.

So I guess my message would be to everyone who is trying to deal with someone with an insecure AS who is unaware and not making an effort to change: this is not the only way to be in love.

I find that I tend to have a scarcity mindset and so when I only talk to one person and they are responsive, I tend disregard many things about them, whether they are avoidant, boring, compatible with me or even truly care about me. I just lazer focus on the fact that there is this one guy who is still chatting with me and then end up building them up so much in my head and putting them on a pedestel that I forget there are tons of other guys out there, many of whom are much more compatible with me.

And when you start to talk to others you realize how wrong the first person was for you and how really they are nothing special. This is one of the mistakes I have made in the past and trying to avoid making again.

Secure people are able to see that there are tons of options available to them at all times, but for us it is much harder to see unless we talk to multiple people.

392,I finally managed to set a boundary - It went down like a lead balloon.,"So my avoidant ex came back in January after 2 years of no contact. 

We have been texting and he called me once after I asked. He cancelled 2 meetings and didn't call again when he said he would.

""Hey, how are you?"" once a week followed by a text conversation and suggestions to meet up without any concrete plans.

Last week I finally had enough and replied with thanks I'm good but that I didn't enjoy the texting anymore, sorry. He asked what that meant. I told him that I prefer to meet people and talk on the phone and that he obviously only wants to text and that we are therefore not on the same wavelength.
He TEXTED back that of course we are on the same wavelength and that he too likes meeting and calling. ""Maybe we will simply do this sometime. ""

Boom! I would have laughed if it didn't hurt so much.

So I asked what that meant: ""Maybe yes? Maybe no? Maybe sometime?""

That was 6 days ago and total silence since.

I am incredibly proud of myself for making my needs clear even if it lead to what I didn't want.

393,being with a DA is lonelier than being alone,"Rant coming: I'm really hurting right now and need some support. I'll probably delete when I get over this but I have no where else to rant to because no one knows I'm still with him. My family and friends hate him (as a boyfriend for me) and think I left him a long time ago.

Being with him is worse than being alone because at least when I'm alone, I know the full reason why someone is not there for me. Because they're not there. But with my DA, he's there. He's alive and kicking and I see him often. But it's as if his mind is elsewhere, like he'd rather be anywhere but with me, especially when I need support. He calls me demanding when I ask to meet with him for than once a week. He said I should give him freedom when I said it hurt that he makes more effort with other people than with me, his partner for over 3.5 years. When I need a listening ear, he says i should be able to handle my own problems. When my father became ill, he didn't call me until a week later but it was for 5mins. I understand that death is a trigger for him in this case he's suffered loss from illness. But I needed him to be there for me and the best he could do was a few texts and a phone call. When I returned from seeing my dad, he wasn't even there the morning I came back.

Relationships can't work this way. AP people are given such a bad rep for being needy but even a secure person would be deeply hurt by this. Yes, people should be able to handle themselves. But we are social creatures and as a human, wanting support and closeness is not a crime. 

I understand it now. I get it. I now know why I should leave. It can't go on like this. I am so heartbroken. I'm in so much pain.

396,Dating someone secure does not magically make you secure as well,"Hey everyone,

so I have been spending quite some time on this subreddit and also been reading a lot of material on attachment styles in particular. I believe I have begun to see a pattern on this subreddit when it comes to dating a partner with secure attachment, at least applied to a couple of posts. The general underlying thesis seems to be that dating a secure person will be able to make the AP person's problem to disappear. Or at least make the AP person's  regular insecure and damaging behaviors not to be present in the relationship.

I would like to argue that this is not the case. Of course dating a secure partner will make the anxiety and fear you feel much lower, at least compared to dating someone avoidant. However as long as the AP individual does not make consistent efforts to be more secure in themselves the relationship will still take damage since one of the partners still act on their insecure attachment. Let me elaborate.

Even in secure-anxious relationships the anxious person can still loose themselves to a degree, become co-dependent and violate boundaries. The anxious partner will seem secure until their partner no longer have the energy to keep up with the emotional demands of their partner. This will start a similar spiraling circle as compared to dating an avoidant partner. The secure partner will feel that the balance in the relationship is uneven and, often unconsciously, begin to detach to get some space to even out that imbalance. If the AP person continues to act out on their insecure attachment their partner, in long term relationships, will begin to turn more avoidant and eventually most likely break up with their anxious partner.

This is why it is so important, for an anxious person, to learn to stand on their own two feet. To not loose themselves in the relationship and become co-dependent. I believe most people also stop to work on themselves when they enter a relationship with a secure partner since they initially no longer feel the anxiety they did before in previous relationships etc. However, if you do not continue to regularly work on yourself you will eventually become anxious, even in a secure relationship. A secure person is consistent in showing their love for you but will also eventually detach when their anxious partners become too much. This is because a fully secure relationship both have dependence and space. No partner relies completely on the other and both have fulfilling individual lifes on their own. Never expect a secure partner to always be able to meet your needs completely. They should of course  always be able to meet their partner's basic needs but some of the needs for an AP person is too high or even unreasonable.

Sometimes I feel like that the AP does not seem to understand that their insecure and damaging behaviors can actually make your *secure* partner more *avoidant* and then sometimes even blame them for their avoidant behaviors when they are the one who is the biggest cause for its existence. No secure partner will ever be able to ""save you"" and make you 100% secure without you working on yourself and continuously doing that through out the relationship.

I believe AP persons are the most loving and kind people on this planet but they are just hurt. Hurt by people close to them and has no part of the blame in their insecure foundation. If an AP partner learns to not act on their insecurity and eventually creates a healed much more secure foundation they become the ultimate partner. My purpose with this post was simply to give my personal thoughts on the ""thesis"" that the secure partner will be able to heal their insecure partner for them. Only an AP person can heal themselves.",p16scc,62,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/p16scc/dating_someone_secure_does_not_magically_make_you/,AnxiousAttachment,1

I'll basically tell myself this story about how he probably barely thinks about me, I'm not as much of a priority for him, he *says* things about the future but maybe it's just fake, etc. Usually it happens because I feel like I am relying on him in some way and it doesn't feel safe to depend on anyone in a relationship for me.",lc22g4,65,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/lc22g4/does_anyone_else_easily_convince_themselves_that/,AnxiousAttachment,1

399,AA Manipulation Tactics & Protest Behaviour?,"After starting therapy, my therapist really helped open my eyes to behaviours I'm responsible for that contribute to conflict. I realized my behaviours can be VERY emotionally manipulative and controlling. I would have never noticed I was doing this as it came so instinctively and it was shocking to see how toxic (and red flaggy) my behaviour is. Obviously, it comes from a place of needing re-assurance and not being abandoned, rather than trying to assert power or dominance, but still unhealthy nonetheless.

This is hard to even admit but I'm going to be super vulnerable so here are some of my past behaviours:

1. Doing nice things to expect appreciation - Ex. Buying him the 'perfect' gift and asking him if he's happy with it and likes it, etc. If he doesn't give the enthusiastic appreciation I was expecting, I'll get upset and 'play victim' that he doesn't appreciate what I do for him.
2. Purposefully not answering a text or call so he thinks I'm busy and may call again
3. Lying about having plans with friends so he thinks I'm not needy/clingy and have a life outside of the relationship
4. Over-exaggerating my helplessness/pain (like when I'm sick) so he can dote over, take care of me and check in on me with ""How are you doing today?"" texts
5. Getting wishy washy about our plans. Ex. Making up an excuse or lie that I may not be able to see him or make it to one of our plans just so I can hear him say that he misses me and hopes that I can make it. I usually end up going anyway.
6. Asking questions to 'test' him. Ex. If I'm not able to make the dinner reservation, are you still going to go? Or take someone else?
7. Saying things I don't mean or agreeing to things I'm not okay with and then getting passive aggressive. Ex. Telling him that I want him to spend the weekend with his friends but then making passive aggressive comments afterwards that he has time for his friends but can't spare 2 hours to watch a movie with me. (This one is tough, because I DO want him to spend time with friends but I need to find better ways to not get jealous over this and not need so much of his attention)
8. Irrational Jealousy. Ex. I've always wanted to play tennis with him but he doesn't want to because he thinks I stink. Then the other day he was playing tennis with his friend's 5 year-olds. (I was going to make a passive aggressive comment but stopped myself when I realized how irrational this jealousy is)

**Anyone else do this or is comfortable with sharing examples of some of their behaviours?** I've researched self-sabotaging and protest behaviours but some of the examples are vague and it's easier for me to catch myself if I can have an idea of specific examples. I know this is toxic and I'm committed to changing.

402,On letting go…,"It’s hard, isn’t it?

**Logically**, you know that it was all for the best. That he wasn’t good for you. That the relationship was hurting you more than it was helping you. That you were losing a bit of yourself with each day that you stayed. That it was high time you walked out before you completely lost your sense of self.

**Psychologically**, your brain is still trying to process your new normal—one where you’re not always on edge, worried about what he may/may not be doing, and concerned of if you’re still worthy of his time. Your brain is trying to work out if this sudden change is actually good for you because all it has known for the past year is chaos. There is some familiarity in that state so your brain is actively working to restore those continuous releases of dopamine that came with having small bits of your needs met all the while suffering in a pit of endless degradation from the man you were convinced was good for you.

**Emotionally**, your feelings are still all over the place. One day, you’re filled with joy in knowing that you have your freedom back and are back to living life for yourself. Another day, you wake up feeling all alone and that maybe there was something you could’ve done to make him love you—to see you for the real you. Other days, you’re just so angry at the world and don’t even know where to direct that feeling except into your journals that only you will ever read.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned (yet again), it’s that engaging with toxic, unavailable, entitled, and unloving partners serves more to hurt you than fulfill whatever needs you thought they were meeting. The process of unlearning, re-wiring, and letting go after you’ve finally had enough is draining in and of itself.

*So when am I gonna learn? When will I finally realize that despite having different antagonists, it always ends up being the same fvckin story?*

403,Consistent communication = total game changer!,"I just wanted to share some good news with you all!

I met a nice guy online. And not through a dating app, but through mutual interests, yay. (We live in different countries but hopefully that’s a surmountable issue that we can deal with down the road.) 

At this stage we are friends with potential. We both really like each other and are having fun just getting to know each other.

I suggested we take things slow so we can have plenty of time to get to know each other, and have a good foundation for the future. I don’t want another fast-moving crash and burn “situationship,” and he seems to agree with my “short-term pain for long-term gain” perspective.

Moving on to my main point: 
He has always been a very consistent communicator. It has been email bliss!!!!! I feel so lucky!

Even if it’s just a one or two word reply, he still replies. Usually quickly.

It’s rare he lets a single message go unanswered.

In fact, he’s so consistent about replying that when he missed a scheduled phone chat, plus went another 48 hours without a word, I got super worried. 

Some friends told me to just roll with it and not stress, but it just didn’t feel within our realm of normal.

Turns out he was in the hospital. Without his phone.

When he regained consciousness in the hospital, he borrowed a laptop from a nurse and went through and replied to every single one of the emails I had sent him during the 48 hours we were out of touch. Even the crazy panicked spiraling ones. 

Not with a subtext of “hmm, you’re kinda anxious and weird,” but he just wrote really nice and supportive and funny replies. I’m still almost in shock that he did that for me!

So anyhow, once we got back in touch, I asked him to please start sending me a daily “I’m alive” email, if nothing else. That way I know to only worry if I don’t get that email. 

This new arrangement is doing wonders for my anxiety. I’m in communication heaven!

It helped me stress less about how many replies I get & the occasional  email or text that might go unanswered… because just the fact that he’s willing to write me a nice and friendly daily “I’m alive” email is a big enough affirmation on its own. 

:-)

So yeah. I just wanted to share that, and let you all know that it is possible to find someone willing to be super responsive and do kind things that calm your anxiety instead of constantly triggering it. 

I was kinda hesitant to ask for a daily I’m alive email, but I’m so glad I did. 

It feels so much safer now.

I’m sleeping a ton better. 

It’s awesome.

And it’s awesome to be in touch with someone who really reads your messages, and thinks deeply about them, and brings things up later. 

It’s been a long time since I met someone who truly listens to me and cares about getting to know me. I had almost given up on finding someone who was willing to get beyond the superficial.

It’s just so nice to feel heard and safe. For once!!!

I know that a lot of you also struggle with inconsistent communication from others, and how to balance their comfort level with your basic needs.

So I hope this gives others hope! :-)

416,Letter I (avoidant) want to send my anxiously attached ex. I’m more than open to criticism and feedback. I’m having a hard time writing it and can’t seem to get the tone right. I don’t want her to think worse of me after reading it,"Edit: This is actually going to be an email and not a letter. Definitely not a text as that would be too intrusive and would make it seem like I want a reply back. I don’t expect her to want to get back together after she reads this either. It’s simply an apology and admission of guilt and wrong doing. 



F,

I want you to know I’ve been feeling guilty about that last message I sent ever since I sent it. I’m sorry for lashing out and accusing you of hurting me on purpose. I know you wouldn’t do that. I was coming to conclusions and that wasn’t right of me to drag you down with me. I was lost and confused as it was my first time going through all that. I don’t think little of you nor do I hold any resentment. I’m not mad at you or anything like that. 

I learned about attachment theory in the last few months and realized the role that it played in our relationship. It completely crushed me when I discovered I’m avoidant and the implications that came along with that. Suddenly everything started to make sense and explained way too much. When I realized how I made you feel it was a horrible feeling. I can’t apologize enough for that. I had no idea what I was doing or why I was doing it. I never meant to hurt you and make you feel dismissed. 

I now know you’re anxiously attached and that there’s a science behind how we are. You weren’t asking much of me at all and I see that now. You were only asking of me what you needed, which was the bare minimum. I’m truly sorry for making you feel alone in the relationship. You didn’t deserve any of that.

When I said you were too much that was my avoidant traits trying to justify why I was feeling how I was. Our attachment styles really clashed in that way. I can’t blame everything on that, or me being avoidant, but it didn’t help one bit. I had such internal conflict when I wasn’t sure why I was feeling how I was. That was really holding me back and causing such turmoil within me. I’d like to say now that I know what the issue is that I’ll fix it, but that will require a lot of work and won’t happen overnight. You had every reason to believe that I wasn’t going to change though and I don’t blame you for thinking that. Now I want nothing more than to move to a more secure attachment style. 

I wanted to be alone because that’s when I felt the safest. To be by myself wasn’t to get away from you, it was to get away from the situation and the conflict. Part of me didn’t care to look within to try and figure myself out while the other part was scared of what I’d find. When I finally let myself do just that, it all came crashing down.

I’m doing what I can to get better. I can see therapy doing more good than I ever thought it could. I’m a few appointments in and it’s already helping. I always believed that I didn’t need it and that I was above it. I couldn’t have been more wrong though. Journaling has a helped a ton too as it gets my thoughts and feelings out there. Quitting weed is something I’ve been needing to do for a long time as well. I depended on it for way too many years and finally pulled the plug a couple months ago. It didn’t help the relationship when I didn’t answer calls because I didn’t want you to see or hear me high. They say avoidants have a sort of addiction that lets them escape in a way and mine was certainly weed.

So I want you to know that you had such an impact on my life that you made me want to change for the better. Unfortunately it took a relationship ending with someone I truly care about to figure that out. It took trauma and heartbreak to kick start the process. Sometimes all it takes is someone’s own desire to be a better person, and no one else can do it for them or make them see what they need to see.

I’m sorry if reaching out sets you back in any way. I mainly wanted to make sure there were no ill feelings between us. To apologize for how I was is needed for closure and to help me better move on. Hopefully it helps you too.

Sincerely,
O

417,"When anxious, look for facts","For those of you with anxious attachment, one of the greatest things that I have done consistently for myself to help me feel more secure and move towards a secure attachment is: 

Whenever I have a bad thought, I spend time looking at the facts that don’t support that thought.

It is tough at first because it normally feels like my brain is SCREAMING AT ME that my partner doesn’t love me etc.

But if I look at the facts. Write them down. Read them over and over again, the facts don’t lie. My brain will lie to me sometimes. Facts tell the truth.

So as an example...after a fight, my partner needs space. Let’s say one time he forgets to let me know when he will be back (an agreement we have, but if he is super shutdown...he doesn’t think to tell me because he is in flight mode). 

My brain used to tell me, HE WILL LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK.

Now. I think about the facts. 

He’s needed space before and came back each time.
We have a trip in a year together we planned and just put a deposit down on.
If he texts during his space away. I make sure I include that as a fact, because it IS contact. 

It calms my thoughts. It keeps me logical. It helps the anxiety.

Would I later, in a non defensive way, remind him of our agreement? Yes. I will state my needs, but that’s the beauty of space...it allows me time to formulate these statement so I can get my needs met, without triggering my avoidant partner.

This is assuming your partner is also working on it. I get if the person is inconsistent and is treating you poorly, but the facts would still show you the truth. I am now at a place that I would not accept that. I would move on. Because that’s not ok.

But for a partner who is trying and needs space, I need to allow that. And this is a way that I’ve been able to get really good at letting him have that space and keep myself happy, logical and content.

I am actually becoming a person that appreciates space after a fight! Which I NEVER thought I would be. EVER.

So for those of you who have this same issue. Maybe it will help. I will tell you at first it was VERY DIFFICULT.  Now...it literally just takes a few seconds.

I will still have these feelings time to time. BUT...I don’t HAVE TO SUFFER with them. I have control over this. Rarely is my anxiety filled narrative true.

419,Dealing with Triggers: A simple method which is working for me,"As we all know, the anxiety we experience can be utterly debilitating. Often times, I find I can be paralysed on the same spot while my head goes round and I ruminate on triggering topics and therefore I become less productive.

However, one thing which I've been trying in the last few days has been really working wonders for my productivity. The method is: simply pushing through. When I notice that I'm beginning to entertain thoughts which are anxiety inducing or triggering, I just continue doing what I'm doing even if I'm doing it badly. In a way, I train my body not to be influenced by the damagng thoughts in my head. As a result I still manage to get stuff done, and even if it isn't the best standard, the mere accomplishment means I won't feel super shitty about myself for not having achieved much in my day. 

Bear in mind, it is NOT easy. I burst into tears while I was cleaning my room and nearly stopped what I was doing to crawl into bed. I stopped myself and I continued cleaning my room anyways. Was it super clean as usual? No. But did I at least make my bed and fold my clothes? Yes. So now I have a decent room and while my anxiety was still at work, I didn't go to bed feeling terrible for not having cleaned my room. 

Maybe you can try it out for when you need to concentrate on work or studying. I know it isn't easy so it takes a lot of practice. I've been doing it for a few days so I'm no pro at this but it's proven helpful for me so hopefully it's also helpful for you guys!",la11ip,63,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/la11ip/dealing_with_triggers_a_simple_method_which_is/,AnxiousAttachment,1

me, that was communication. I tried to deal with avoidants who don’t text as much and never call, and I never realized how much I was missing out on when it comes to my needs. DO NOT SETTLE.

Thanks everyone for your insights! It’s really helpful to know so many people feel the same way.

She just doesn’t feel safe to me and I want to stay away.",12r1knn,65,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/12r1knn/anxious_in_relationships_but_cold_with_my_mom/,AnxiousAttachment,1
422,For those struggling to let that one person go 👀,"If you truly think about it, you trying way too hard to keep them in your life is actually hurting them. How will they know they can't just mistreat people and expect them to stay? 

There has to be consequences for treating people badly. I tend to complain about people taking me for granted and hurting my feelings, but do I really have the right to complain when I keep giving them compliments, giving them my company, making them gifts, and taking them back after ghosting me or not respecting my boundaries? 

Even if I'm not saying this out loud, I'm telling this person ""hey, you can treat me like gum on the bottom of your shoe and I will continue to kiss your ass because I think you're better than me"". A lot of people get off on that, don't give them that kind of power. 

Or you're telling them ""you don't have to grow up, I'm going to continue coddling you like you're a child even though it's depleting me of all my energy because acting like your surrogate mommy/daddy is how I get myself worth and feel important for once"".

These are very damaging messages to send both to yourself and the other person, if they see this they think they can take their sack of red flags to other people because it works apparently. No one is holding them accountable

 (sometimes they don't care about you leaving and will take their sack of red flags to others anyway.. You might be one of *many* people that has to turn them away before they realize they have a problem that's destroying their relationships)

It's also good to take a look at yourself and wonder how your own ego is coming into play. I noticed that I had the same egotistical mindset of ""I want to win and be the powerful one"", only thing was my anxious attachment didn't allow that. 

I guess I got my ""power"" from being codependent. Thinking ""Nobody can love you the way I can,"". I didn't say or feel this consciously, it sat under the surface of my psyche. It's honestly a very arrogant mindset that set me back and caused me to take rejection way more personally than I should.

Back to the original point. Those are my reasons why you have to go no contact with anyone who is hurting you. And you *cannot* come back because they won't learn the lesson that treating people badly will make them leave. Coming back or staying will enable and keep the mistreatment alive.",124dj10,64,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/124dj10/for_those_struggling_to_let_that_one_person_go/,AnxiousAttachment,1

425,How to move on from someone,"I have found the best way to move on from someone not good for me is to think from 25 years from now how will I feel telling this story to my kids if this person ends up being the one. 

""I really liked your father but he breadcrumbed me for 2 years""

""I really loved your father but he cheated on me 5 times and manipulated me into believing it's my fault so I stayed with him""

""I really hated your father but I was scared I won't find anyone else so here we are""

""I finally got your father to commit after 6 years of keeping it casual""

""Your father took 6 working days to reply my text with one word but I held on till he finally settled for me""


How does all this sound? Does this bring you joy? Does it fill you with pride? Will these statements make your kids say ""oh I wish I have that""

As APs our first instinct when someone treats us badly is to try to make it work at any cost. But think of the big picture. Will I really want this story to be the story I tell my kids? Obviously not. So even if it works out with the current person I'm seeing and tolerating whatever shitty behaviour he's subjecting me to I don't really want to be with him in long run because this is not what I want my story to be.


Whoever you're seeing I'd suggest you try this exercise.

426,My Ex is dating the “girl I didn’t need to worry about”,"My ex (37M) and I (26F) dated for three years.  Lived together, thought I was going to marry him, the whole deal.  He broke up with me kind of out of the blue last year.  He couldn’t give me much of a reason for the break up, he just said he didn’t feel the same way about me anymore.

My ex doesn’t like to cut exes, or people he dated briefly, out of his life.  While we were dating, he talked to this one girl in particular (he dated her briefly).  I spoke to him about her several times.  I tried to play “cool girlfriend” and be okay with it.  I cried and told him “I’m sorry I know it’s my insecurity that’s causing me to be uncomfortable with your friendship with her.  I trust you”.  I thought it was just my anxious attachment that was causing me to “act crazy over nothing”.

He hid messages even though I asked him to just be open about their friendship.  He said he hid the messages because it obviously bothered me that he was talking to her.  I tried to explain that I would rather him be completely transparent.  If she was “such a close friend”, why did I know nothing about her and why did he hide her messages.

Anyways, life goes on.  We break up due to unrelated (I think…?) circumstances.  I move on and find someone that has brightened my whole life (I’ve made a couple posts here about him in the past).

I found out yesterday that my ex is dating the woman we fought about throughout our whole relationship.  I feel like an idiot.  I feel hurt.  My anxiety about the situation was valid.

I don’t feel like I’m allowed to be upset right now.  My current boyfriend, the angel that he is, talked about it with me and said I have a right to feel everything I’m feeling.  He said it wasn’t right what my ex did, and what I’m feeling is normal given the situation.  

I had a feeling this would happen, and I thought I would just be angry.  But I’m actually just sad.  I’m sad that I was right.  I feel used.  He made me feel like I was crazy.  I should have known when he dismissed me constantly and refused to put up some reasonable boundaries.  I put that man on a pedestal, and he knew I did.  I deserved better than that.  Before we broke up he told me I deserved better than him.  I should have believed him!

I’m incredibly happy now for the position I’m, but I mourn for the girl who felt like she was crazy whenever she worried about their friendship.  She wasn’t wrong, her feelings were valid.

427,"Ground-breaking tip from my therapist: ""What's the worst that can happen?""","Let me preface this by saying that I'm a secure who suffered from anxiety (general, and in relationships) due to trauma before working my way back to mostly secure.

While I was already well on my way back, I noticed that one of my triggers in relationships was, predictably, when someone would suddenly grow 'cold' and I would get anxious, feeling like I would never hear from or see them again (spoiler alert: it wasn't totally unjustified, the relationships were bad and volatile and were in fact headed down, but nevertheless I wanted to react calmly and not have it trigger my anxiety). I wanted to have a discussion to clarify whether we were ok or ending it, but I was anxious because I was afraid of the answer.

As I was telling my therapist about this particular situation, she asked me: **""Ok. So what is the worst thing that can happen?""**

That I never hear from him again / that I have the talk and the answer is negative / that we break up / etc.

""Ok. And what's the worst thing that can happen then?""

What a lightbulb moment. The rational answer was: I will be upset, I will grieve the relationship / miss this person for a while, and then I will move on with my life and be fine. I had been through grief and loss (break-ups, deaths) before and eventually I was always fine, so it would be like that again.

That's it. Simple. ""What's the worst that can happen?""

The root of the anxiety was that completely irrational feeling that, somehow, *my life depended on it.* The panic reaction was as if *I would die if abandoned.* And that tied back to the root of the anxiety: if a child is abandoned by the attachment figure (the parent) it will die, so it is indeed a question of life and death. But I was no longer a child, I was a self-sufficient adult, and 'abandonment' by the attachment figure (partner) was not a threat to my life.

(We then spent some time unpacking the root of that, namely my beloved father's sudden death when I was teenager and the trauma it caused).

After that, every time the anxiety tried to pop up, I always sat down and asked myself: ""Ok. So what's the worst that can happen?"" and that helped me bring everything back to a rational level where it didn't feel all completely blown out of proportion. I still use this technique now, not in relation to anxiety but when I'm worried about making some big decision. I find it's so simple but an absolute game-changer.",s0o5i7,62,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/s0o5i7/groundbreaking_tip_from_my_therapist_whats_the/,AnxiousAttachment,1
428,Things are good now. Previously hard-core AP/DA couple become secure. It can happen.,"Hey all. I've been wanting to write this feel good post for a while now but I've felt hesitant for some reason. I think i felt that the moment I did then I would find myself spiralling again and I would just feel like an idiot. But after a couple months of consistency and growing love I can't really keep my mouth shut.

I tell ya what, nothing feels better than to be AP and feel like all the hard work has paid off, that's what we're all looking for right? One day he'll realise what I do for him? One day he'll break through the pain of feeling vulnerable and know its ok and not have to run and hide? One day our love will win? I used to bounce between feeling like I must be insane to feeling like a true romantic. Not sure if this is a common AP trait but for whatever reason I just always knew it was worth holding on and seeing what was on the other side.

We have gone through he'll the last 2.5 years. Push/pull. Breaks. Break-ups. So many tears (mine). So much heart break because we just could never get it right there were always so many strong feelings but the dynamic was always ruined by me being anxious about his intentions and him feeling suffocated and scared (and running). But we'd always come back to each other and commence the cycle again.

Then I started coming here. I started learning about attachment theory. I showed him too. It helped but not straight away. Knowing this stuff was one thing but putting it into practice was another.

The last time my bf pulled away was a couple months ago for no other reason other than he wasn't feeling well and began to withdraw from me and also life itself. 

This time I knew it had nothing to do with me. Perhaps it was a combination of the work I had been doing to feel secure but also the fact we had no obvious fight to push him away. I stood back and let him have space *knowing he's doing his avoidant thing* . Sometimes these withdrawels could last weeks. This time it only lasted about 5 days and he apologised. 

We went away for the weekend. Even though I was still hurting inside from recent withdrawel and scared it would keep happening I wanted to show him I could give him space if he needed it and when it's done, not come down on him with vengeance afterwards. So I just relaxed and had a great weekend for the most part. One anxious moment led me to sneak a peek at his phone while choosing a song, I saw he had been researching ""avoidant attachment /withdrawel"" etc my heart nearly exploded. I couldn't believe he was reading about this stuff in private.

On our way home he turned to me and said ""I feel really good about us "".

The following weeks we just continued to get along with no extreme push/pull. He began writing me the odd message ""good morning babe, how's your day going"" ""hey beautiful, what would you like for dinner tonight?"" These things kept me going and eased my worries. In person he became more affectionate. Always leaning in on the couch, grabbing my feet and rubbing them. Kissing me first in bed. Spooning me throughout the night etc . Again, these things eased my worries.

He came to my friends house and made an effort with them all. He came to my dads dinner. Eventually I got the point where there were no worries to be eased. 

This is where anxiety crept in. I began freaking out about it being *too good* . I was waiting for the other shoe to drop. Waiting for the withdrawel. I brought it up. He simply said ""all we can do is communicate better next time if it happens. We know now its nothing to do with you"" . I chose to let it go. I made a concious decision to throw this thought out the window because it wasn't serving me.

He invited me to his mums dinner. It was an amazing night. Later that night I don't think he'd ever kissed me so much.

Last week he brought his daughter round to my house just so he could babysit the kids so I could get ready for an event without stressing out (his idea) he made them breakfast and played with them for hours. When I came home later on I noticed he also cleaned my house.

This weekend just gone we spent the whole weekend together at his place (were in covid lockdown) and we had the most fun we've had in ages just hanging out. Cooking, dressing up in fancy dress clothes and face timing friends (we had a party but got cancelled), having amazing sex. At one point he let slip that he got me a ring for my birthday (and was kicking himself for saying it hah). 

He talked about his plans to build a 4 bedroom house at the back of his property (at the moment it's only him and his daughter living together) and talked about us living together.

He gets into bed and lays on my side to warm it for me before I get in.
He sends me pics of houses he likes.
He holds my head in his hands while he kisses me slowly. He kisses my forehead in bed all the time.
He supports me quitting my job (im hating it at the moment and it's destroying my soul) and offered to withdraw money to help me through if I need.
Had planned to do a speech at my birthday party coming up (I was shocked and said you don't have to! But now kinda regretting it haha) 
Offered to pay for a hotel that night just so I could have the night I wanted 
Told me he's excited to give me my present 
Made me get dressed and come to the shops with him when I was feeling depressed saying it will cheer me up and rejuvenate me. And it did.
When I was sick the other day he specifically made pumpkin& vegie soup to make me better.

I could go on and on. The great thing here is the great stuff he's doing is becoming so common I can barely keep track. I used to actually write these things down to remind myself he has feelings.

We had a brief chat about all this on Saturday night and I mentioned that things had been great for ages. He said something like ""I just had to be myself, I just needed time to come to conclusions on my own and not be told what to do and how to act"". Hes referring to me always critiquing him and telling him ""this is what I need! I need xyz, you don't do this you don't do that etc "" . 

The most amazing thing here is, he used to cringe at romance. Being soft and open made him wince. Now that I've stepped back and am relaxed in this he is actually going out of his way to be romantic. In the past when I would say ""oh you're just a sweetie"" he would roll his eyes and grumble that I've just made him sound soft . Now he's does stuff and I say ""what a sweetie"" and he will proudly say ""yep. I AM a sweetie"". 

There's no walls up anymore. We can breathe. There's this air of relief among us. I've slept the best I've ever slept in the last couple months . I can say what I want without fearing he will think I'm obsessed. He can say what he wants about the future without worrying about massive expectations placed on him. If he doesn't text me tonight I shrug and think its ok, if inhave something to say I'll say it otherwise I'll just wait til tomorrow and he'll probably text me. And sure enough morning comes around and he will say ""morning babe, hope you're having a nice day"". If he wants to catch up with a friend on one of ""our"" nights because the footballs on he will tell me in advance and ask if jts OK and I'll say yes because i appreciate he thought of me. And he appreciates that I'm flexible. And around and around the *secure* cycle we go.

I don't know what the future holds, all I know is that I've been through it all with him. I've been here on this sub pleading for help with my DA . Cried so many tears trying to understand him. Wondering if there will ever be a happy ending. And I think I can finally admit that I'm in it. Its only been 2 months. But right now I can't imagine ever going back to that anxious push/pull place. I feel secure in what I want and what I expect. If there's less than desirable moments I'm not jumping to the worst case scenarios anymore.

If you're still reading well done . I think I just needed to write a diary entry and put this down into words. Its quite therapeutic to be able to admit the struggles and remember the pain and then acknowledge how it's been turned around. Letting the pain go. Moving forwards.

I truly hope others can feel the same peace one day soon. I know its so difficult recognising if this person is worth all the trouble. I guess all we can do is work on ourselves individually and gently encourage them to as well.

429,Waiting for something real,"One of the most insidious aspects of an anxious attachment style is that we go out into the world with such a fear of being unseen, unloved, and unappreciated, that the moment we are seen/loved/appreciated, even just a little bit, we cling onto it for dear life. It’s like being dehydrated in the desert, you’ll gulp whatever water you can find. 

Unfortunately, this causes us to sacrifice long-term sources of love for short-term fixes.

Because the types of people who provide love quickly enough to meet our immediate desperation are not the types of people who will provide it in the long run. We fall victim to love-bombing, we ignore red flags of addiction, or just wind up in a painful relationship with an avoidant. So, this leaves us on a painful carousel of barely getting our needs met, followed by either a rupture that leaves us in an even worse place or an ongoing pattern of trying and failing to meet our needs with a person who is incapable of it. 

The solution of course is to realize that we can fill our own cup with love and appreciation.

I've changed my therapist in the last five or so months, and I've been feeling my anxious attachment issues getting slowly easier to manage. In general, I've had a pattern of getting romantically attached to avoidant-attached people (both DA and FA, most recently someone who seems to be an FA), so I've been struggling a lot with communication and managing to have a healthy dynamic with a potential partner. In general, they get interested and pushy first, and then I get attached to them, we have a short honeymoon phase until they retract and I'm left guessing (and hurt). 

As I was saying, recently I feel a lot more secure in my life in general, and I've started recognizing some relational patterns with the help of my therapist which helped me a lot to understand and self-soothe my AP tendencies. One would be that I get the happy love pill from engaging with people who make me feel unsafe and feel the need to work for their affection, to prove worthy of their love (we all know that's a bit toxic and it ends badly 99.9% of the time), and I became more mindful of how I enforce my boundaries in that sense. I've been really proud of my composure recently and managing to distract my attention and be less reliant on constant contact, and I managed to invest more time in building a more secure relationship with myself. 

I am writing this because recently I've been going through a bit of a down moment caused by my FA love interest, and I'm losing a bit of the... security I gained, in lack of a better word. I didn't mind it so much until I started getting chest pains due to my anxiety, and I started questioning my own progress. Now I know that everyone's journey is different and it is absolutely normal to have ups and downs, but I wanted to have a sharing moment with you all (if you want to share, that is), of moments that made you feel like you were making progress towards secure and healthy attachments and how you have achieved them.

431,The blindspot that keeps you repeating the same relationship cycles,"This YouTuber has quickly become one of my favorite YouTubers for attachment theory content. She's releasing a series of videos on the relationship cycles and blindspots each insecure attachment faces. So far she has done avoidant and anxious. I'm waiting on Fearful attachment myself. But she was spot on for the avoidant and anxious folks in my life. I highly suggest if you're struggling to realize your own patterns to watch. Her other content is gold as well!

432,Does anybody experience wanting to pull away when someone doesn’t give you the time you want with them?,"I (27F) only see him (33M) once a week and twice if I’m lucky, yet we only live 10 mins away and he now works odd hours in person.

When he worked from home in the past, it was still the same (only 1-2 days together). But in those days, communication would be more constant with video calls almost daily after work.

And now that things have changed with no video calls and barely a text a day, it’s become much harder for me. Things have changed. 

And while we probably will meet again this week, I feel like pulling away and distancing myself. I just feel exhausted wanting more, and yet I can’t get what I want. Do you ever want to pull away?

TLDR: We usually only see each other once a week, and it’s not enough for me. Now it makes me want to pull away.

441,Will it ever get better??,"Today it feels like I am broken and will never be fixed. No matter how much self awareness, how much therapy, how many books I’ve read on trauma, abandonment and attachment, how many Reddit threads I’ve poured over - I am permanently fucking broken. It feels almost comical how no matter who or what the circumstances, like clockwork I find myself at this insufferable point 6-8 weeks into any relationship. Just a little too much time has gone by since the last text I received, or the response to the last thing I said wasn’t what I thought it should be - the list of triggers that would seem completely benign to a healthy individual is infinite. 

Tonight, at 5pm, it had been 24 hours since I last heard from the guy I’ve been on 8 dates with. Our last communication was him declining my impromptu invitation to grab lunch because he had plans to meet with his realtor. Why didn’t he text me later? Why didn’t he try to make other plans? Why didn’t he send me a text this morning? Why isn’t he dying to see me again like I am him? Why do I feel such a fucking NEED to be affirmed by someone that I don’t even KNOW THAT WELL YET??? I become so obsessed, triggered, anxious, angry, scared, rejected, convinced it has ended. I’m so desperately tired of this wheel. I’ve been on it so many goddamn times. 

I turned off my text message notifications at 5:30pm today. I haven’t looked at my texts since. I won’t look at them until tomorrow. It’s this absurd coping mechanism I’ve developed. I’d rather not know whether or not he’s reached out than sit with the mounting dread of every hour that goes by that I haven’t heard. And of course, the moment will come when I finally do check - and my entire emotional state for the day will be determined by whether or not there’s a text from him. It’s all so black and white. I feel such a deep NEED to know if he’s IN or OUT. Every move he makes is analyzed to smithereens in an attempt to uncover his true intentions and potential departure. 

I feel so much shame about this behavior - all of it. I am not one of those who calls constantly, texts constantly, tries to seek the affirmation.  I suffer in silence and pretend to be cool. I am TERRIFIED of looking desperate or needy. It feels like I’d rather DIE than be viewed as the one who cares more in the relationship. So I hide all of this and just suffer and pretend. The only moments I enjoy any new relationship are the moments when I am physically with that person. Every other moment is filled with fear, anxiety, second guessing, and distrust. 

If you’ve gotten this far then I give you a shitload of credit. I dont even know if it was coherent. I don’t know if there’s even a point to this post - I just had to get this out to people who get it. If you can relate to any of this I’d love to hear from you. I’d love to hear how you cope in these moments. Or how you don’t. What absurd tricks and protest behaviors you employ. Tomorrow I’ll try to get in a more solution oriented mindset, but tonight I just feel defeated.",kde3eq,60,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/kde3eq/will_it_ever_get_better/,AnxiousAttachment,1

She basically told me how being with me makes her uncomfortable and she’s happier when we aren’t speaking. I learned a lot from this relationship though. People like myself are love addicts. I love hard and care hard, but I am ignorantly selfish. I want what I want and don’t think too much about the other persons feelings until it’s slapped in my face. And even once I know, I can quickly abandon it whenever I am triggered. I hate myself a lot right now, but I know that this ending was inevitable. Her and I were too different and I let my anxiety take the reins. I wish I could have been different but maybe we were just not compatible.

443,"Dumped by DA ex. They reached out after 4 months, asking for ""closure conversation""... Advice? AITA if I say no?","Separated from my DA partner of 10 years back in September & have been no-contact since middle of October. Yesterday, I received a text saying he feels like there was no closure, and asking if we can meet or if he can send me an email. 

Anyone had a similar experience, or have any advice on if/how to reply? 

It’s been 4 months. I’ve found my own closure and am in a good place. I feel like this is more for his benefit than mine; and TBH, in my gut, I just don’t want to meet or read anything from him... Feels like it would only be rehashing a wound. Even seeing his text yesterday triggered tears and my heart racing. Part of me worries this is him finally feeling his feelings and tugging my string to see if I’ll respond. But maybe I’m being cowardly/immature/unthoughtful? (This post isn’t meant to bash DA’s. They just are how they are, and we are how we are. Y’all know how it is.)  

For context… how we separated… He stonewalled for a week. I confronted him. He said he’d grown a lot in the last couple years *(side note: he was in grad school those 2 years while I worked full-time & was going through a period of depression/anxiety/trichotillomania).* Basically implied he’d outgrown me. I apologized multiple times for not being present enough. I asked at different points if he wanted to separate/try a trial separation/work on the relationship. He barely spoke and wouldn’t commit to a decision, so while he was the one to initiate, I was the one to “officially” end it. 

I went to stay at my mom’s. He stayed in the house *(side note: for all intents and purposes, it was my house. He refused to be on the mortgage, didn’t help pay for the furniture and rarely helped pay for major projects).* I didn’t hear anything for a week, so I reached out to ask him to be out by “x” date, because I was making plans to put the house on the market. He replied asking if I was going to take all the furniture. In the subsequent weeks, the only times I heard from him were to ask what kitchen appliances he could take, if he could take the lawnmower, if he could take baskets & canisters from the pantry, and if I would let his dog out on my lunch break. Then he was gone. No goodbye letter, text, call. 

I really struggled the first couple months. Was confused because I felt like I’d been… forced into being the one to end things? And like I was the bad guy for doing it then enforcing a boundary that he needed to leave the house. And I felt hurt, because even in the separation, his thoughts were centered around the logistics of what he could take with him in leaving. 

I did a ton of analyzing and reflecting. I discovered attachment theory and the anxious-avoidant dynamic. I made peace with both of our strengths and shortcomings. And I reached my own place of acceptance/forgiveness/closure a few weeks ago. Looking back, it was such an emotionally taxing and consuming relationship. It wore me down over the years, and I’m relieved to be out. Though I’m disappointed in/feel disrespected by a lot of his behavior, I don’t harbor ill-will towards him. Just focused on doing my own thing, improving myself and looking forward to the future.  

Do I owe him a sense of closure?",10mpi7e,62,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10mpi7e/dumped_by_da_ex_they_reached_out_after_4_months/,AnxiousAttachment,1

445,Stalking partner/ ex / partner’s ex /partner’s friends on social media,"Edit: One comment here in this thread really sums it up, and I want to share it with you.

“Stalking is just an illusion of control over the situation.” 

Think about it. 

Hey guys,

Lately I have seen a lot of posts where people posted about stalking their partner/ ex/ partner’s ex or friends on social media. What I found weird is that it was said in a way that normalises such behaviour 

“As AP of course I would search for [it] on social media..”
“As typical AP I would stalk […]…”

Yes, APs with their anxiety and overthinking are often prone to stalking people on Social Media. But we have to be aware that it is toxic and unhealthy behaviour that only leads to even more suffering from our side.

Snooping, stalking, that’s all a big no no and also for our partner’s a huge glaring red flag about us! Guys, work on your issues and impulses! And don’t normalise stuff like this just because other APs do it as well. That’s no excuse whatsoever!",v92cvu,59,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/v92cvu/stalking_partner_ex_partners_ex_partners_friends/,AnxiousAttachment,1
446,Some Uplifting Reminders 👀,"1. How people treat you isn't a reflection of you, *it's a reflection of them* (unless you did something bad to them ofc) 


2. You're stronger and more influential than you think


3. Change is always possible and you're capable of it (even if it sometimes doesn't feel that way) 


4. It's okay to feel negative emotions such as anger, sadness, guilt, resentment, shame etc (because embracing negative feelings is how you process them and work with them)


5. It's okay to let people go to protect your energy. Even if this means blocking them or cutting them off entirely (I've seen people say it's petty to block others but that's not true! Your sanity comes first)


6. You might make mistakes and relapse into old behaviors but that's okay, it's normal and apart of the healing process ❤️.

448,Reflection About The Desire To Get Back Together With An Ex,"Have been reflecting on the desire I see quite often on here and have at times shared, to get back together with an ex, esp a DA leaning ex. 

It’s really common for us to feel like our reactions / behaviors / etc was the thing to disintegrate the relationship, and if we just could’ve XYZ, the end wouldn’t have happened. And we swear to ourselves that we’ve reflected on our behavior, and if we get another chance we won’t do those same things again.

But this is super damaging! It creates an implicit expectation of constantly self-monitoring and trying to be “good” or avoid conflict. 

I remember watching a documentary about a man who was studying couples who were in the verge of divorce. One thing he said that really stood out to me was “how much a couple argues isn’t an indicator of the health or longevity of their relationship, I’ve seen lots of couples who argue regularly who have very strong loving relationships. It’s how they come back together after an argument that indicates the health of the relationship.” He went on to explain that dismissiveness, avoidance, and stonewalling were some of the most corrosive behaviors in all relationships he witnessed, and that actually, the couples who didn’t actively “argue” were some of the most toxic / unhealthy relationships he witnessed. 

Which is to say that: conflict isn’t bad. It’s a part of life. You can’t enter into a relationship with the expectation that you’ll always be on perfect behavior and there won’t be any more conflict because now you know how to not do that anymore. Conflict is HUMAN. 

What we need to know is that, in our relationships, we are invited to be our complete selves (sometimes messy, not perfect, not always nice, not always agreeable) and that 1) we are still loved and accepted 2) our partner will advocate for themselves to receive proper treatment and so will we and 3) that you collectively love each other enough that you *want* to improve communication, find new ways of getting needs met, and be more loving. This is a collaborative process! This is NOT something you can do on your own through intensive self-monitoring and minimizing. 

Of course we want to not participate in protest behaviors, it is painful to watch ourselves do so. But we have to ask ourselves. If we completely disengaged from doing excessive work in these relationships, would they stand on their own? Or would they be incomplete / unfulfilling / surface level? Your partner has to want and *participate* in doing this work as much as you do. 

I’m not saying it’s not possible to resolve things with an ex, to get back together and have it be healthy, or to find common ground. But please at the very least consider that this person was not actually the person for you, and that, although the loss is painful and difficult, you now have space for healthier, deeper and more fulfilling relationships on the horizon. 

Do not allow one person to become the pinnacle of your fixation or convince yourself they have the key to your pain, happiness, or to love and therefor enter back into a dynamic where you KNOW intuitively within yourself that you are self limiting. It is not normal to feel that one mis-step (aside from cheating / blatant disrespect to the relationship) has the power to corrode your relationship, and that your “good” behavior has the power to save it. This is an unrealistic pressure to put on ourselves and an enabling way to engage in relationships with another person. 

Please consider what you really want, how you really want to feel in a relationship. If a relationship cycles back around and you find it checks all those boxes, go ahead and try it out. But if it doesn’t, please don’t walk all over your own boundaries, needs, and expectations in an effort to feel worthy / approved by someone who simply isn’t right for you.",n46u8z,60,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/n46u8z/reflection_about_the_desire_to_get_back_together/,AnxiousAttachment,1

I attribute text frequency and cadence into whether someone likes me or not and its largely because im always available. I work on a desk job, and my personal laptop is right next to me, and anytime a text comes through I can knock out a response. 

Not only do I feel like it establishes an expectation of available that is sometimes hard to keep up, but I feel like it looks like im constantly waiting and obsessing over their messages and then of course due to some anxious tendencies makes me fixate on waiting and waiting for a response and 2 hours can feel like an eternity.

I was basically asking ""Do you plan on ignoring me, like I'm not even in the room? If so, let's set that expectation because ghosting/stonewalling can really trigger my abandonment issues and that's when I start to act crazy""

""I can't control how you react to me. I can only control me. If it seems like I'm avoiding you, stop for a moment to consider this - The world does not revolve around you, and you are not the center of the universe. As strange as it may sound, things happen that have absolutely nothing to do with you. If you can realize this in the moment, maybe you can avoid being triggered by something that you mistakenly thought was about you, but actually had nothing to do with you. I really think that sometimes you get upset about things that aren't related to you or within your control.""

Set up by friends and initially I got the ick from him, he was awkward, shy not that funny didn't dress great was very ridged and not overly attractive. (37 without many relationships)

He was nice but also reminded me so much of my dad (hard DA), I loved my friends and decided to give him a shot thinking my 'ick' was an FA deactivation thing, I thought this guy was a safer option lol. His friends said he was so great and that 'he'd dote on me'

Anyway like most people have experienced with an avoidant, first few months were great, he pursued me hard and wanted to be exclusive early, then after 3 months he deactivated but said it was depression. We were also doing long distance 

8 months later, after his last visit where we met each other's parents, he deactivated hard, I was over it and said we need to talk (he was conflict adverse) basically ended it over the phone. 

Its been a week and I still have this huge hit to my self esteem and sadness over it despite him actually being a terrible partner in the last 5 months. 

Why can we still feel a lot of sadness even if that person didn't meet any needs and I felt alone for most the relationship?

No matter what other people say or write up here… do what you believe in, love and give love to who you believe in. Thank you all for your kind words in the past. I am happy now, and I wish the same for everyone here.

I've been spiraling down since the weekend since I've started to feel him being cold and not engaging with me like he used to. We are long distance so this is triggering me even more since I can't be physically with him right now to have a conversation (we already spent a lot of time together in real life) 

I feel like we are close to break since he has been displaying avoidant and dismissive behaviors.

I know he was hurt badly in the past but this is not an excuse to hurt someone that already did so much for him in just some months.

I feel jealous of every person that is not anxious because my emotions just feel too much right now.

I was healing from my attachment style with him since he was very secure in the beginning but slowly has been changing. I feel super triggered right now and my anxiety is hitting an all time high.

463,6 weeks after breakup with avoidant,"I could write many things. But I will say this:

I forgot what it feels like to be this anxiety free. It's been 3 years since I've felt this calm within myself. And I don't say that lightly. As hard as it was to leave him and as painful as it was to say goodbye, the calmness I feel cannot be beaten. I will not blame him for anything because relationships take two and the most important thing is that I did the right thing and I'm continuously working on myself.

I've been reading books, exercising, spending time with friends and finally addressing issues in my life that I was ignoring. It has NOT been easy. And i am still dealing with a lot of shit personally. But I cannot deny how fucking CALM I feel.

I'm also realising just how badly being with someone like him hurt me. Yes we can sit here and grill me about why I stayed. But at least I finally left. And the distance from him has given me the perspective I need. He was mean to me 😞 very mean to me. His deactivations were so bloody hard. And I made excuses for it often. But not this time. I see now clearly how badly he hurt me. And that makes me even more happy with my decision.

I know I rambled. But I thought someone would love to hear it so they know they don't HAVE to stay with someone who hurts you.",ulvd5o,58,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ulvd5o/6_weeks_after_breakup_with_avoidant/,AnxiousAttachment,1

465,Two tips (that helped me) with managing my emotions after meeting someone I really liked and wanted something more (or just wanted them to like me back),"Honestly, after the first date, I became so anxious. I thought I was much further along in my anxiety-healing journey, but I was hyperfixating on him after the first date.

I was also overwhelmed with thoughts like, ""why would someone like him want to be with someone like me? He is so intelligent and attractive!""

We had our second date tonight and I tried two things that I think helped.

(1) I wrote a letter to myself before the date when I found myself in a positive/good mood - writing the things I like about myself, the things I want myself to remember even after the date is over - like the full life I have outside of him, the people that love me, the people that I love and care about, etc.

(2) I made plans for the day after so I prevent myself from hyper-fixating on him right away and then I can also remind myself that I truly do have a life outside of him.

But I do feel anxious about spending time together again when it sounded like my presence isn’t appreciated. I wanted to take a week without seeing him because that hurt so bad, but every time I just forgive and forgive without seeking apologies. Do you have advice on how to open up this conversation and say how I was hurt without turning this on him? He can get quite defensive.

471,What Are Your Relationship And Dating Dealbreakers?,"There is no judgement from me here since we're all different and have our own needs and preferences. I thought this would be a fun thread to create. 

I've really learned from my last relationship with my last ex (more like situationship.) There are things that are dealbreakers for me if they were to come up in my relationship with my current boyfriend of 2 years. I'm not ever gonna allow myself to go through what I went through with my last ex. I'm gonna walk away this time while listening to ""Good As Hell"" by Lizzo and Arianna Grande. 😂💃💅

Here are my dealbreakers:

1.) Cheating. Hell No! I've been cheated on in a few of my previous relationships. This one is non-negoitable. If it happens even once, and I don't even care who it's with (same gender too counts as cheating. My boyfriend is straight, but I have been cheated on by a couple of bisexual men who thought it didn't count cause it was the same gender. GTFO.) I'm out if cheating is involved.

2.) Abuse of any kind. Verbal, emotional, physical, etc. This is another non-negoitable for me. If I'm hit once, I'm out and I'd also have a restraining order. (I can't see my boyfriend ever doing this to me, thank goodness.) Verbal and emotional if it continued and was consistent I'd be out the door as well. I've been in a couple of abusive relationships before, and I never want to go through that again. 

3.) Wanting to see me whenever it is convenient for him. If we aren't regularly seeing each other once a week at least, then I am out. Coming and going as he pleases is a no go for me. Obviously this excludes sometimes, like a mental health crisis, finals in college, and a week long trip with the guys if it was brought to my attention and not something that happened often.

4.) Hot/Cold and Push/Pull relationship dynamic. I went through this toxic roller coaster with my last ex for 5 years on and off. (Ended in 2020, thank goodness.) I never want to go through this dynamic again though, and I prefer consistency. If my boyfriend were to go from consistent for the almost 3 years I've known him, into hot and cold and our relationship dynamic were to start to be push and pull, I'm out and I will walk away. I am never going to put myself through that ever again. Having a mental health crisis is different and doesn't count here, and normal ups and down of life doesn't count here either, and of course if he let me know that he was gonna go quiet for a few days etc, he'd let me know and I'd be fine with it in that case.",10ijqqk,58,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10ijqqk/what_are_your_relationship_and_dating_dealbreakers/,AnxiousAttachment,1

474,"From texting daily to no contact in 36+ hours, how to prepare for the inevitable?","Finally back into dating again, marched with a guy on hinge and in the last five weeks, we’ve been on four dates, talk daily, and things have felt very relationship-y after our last sleepover. He started giving me more updates on his day when he got home from work as you might tell a partner, more cute texts throughout the day, and as far as Wednesday night, it was clear he was on the same page. I was giddy, almost. 

The problem is he works a lot, long hours and late shifts and he’s only off on Thursday and Friday. This is the second time he’s had to cancel a date because he had to go in on a Thursday. So he’s exhausted, he’s worried about getting errands done, etc. I’m trying to be realistic and give him space as we’re not official but I’m following his lead. 

So when he didn’t reply yesterday, I just assumed he was busy and exhausted. Sometimes he’ll not reply to texts because I genuinely think he sees them on the way to somewhere else and forgets. I’ll just send something later and he’ll immediately reply and we’ll chat for a bit. So I figured that was the case yesterday. I sent a photo when I knew he was home from work like I’ve done for the past six days and that’s his “favorite time of day” and it’s become a little ritual. But nothing. So I tried to self soothe and tell myself he was exhausted and fell asleep.

But this morning? Nothing still. It’s 11:30am and maybe he’s still sleeping. But I just have a bad gut feeling, the same when my ex dumped me and had avoided my texts on a day he was “busy.” 

I’ve been trying hard, not double texting for reassurance, not being clingy, letting him dictate the speed with his busy schedule, and I’m just having trouble self soothing for what I expect to be the inevitable message after a few days of ghosting, that he doesn’t have time for a relationship. Based on stuff he’s said, I get the feeling he’s conflict avoidant because he’s worried about hurting feelings and welp, I suspect the hurt is coming. 

So how do you sit with the inevitable? I really thought I got lucky and found a good guy who I vibed with, and now it’s frustrating to go back to the apps.",xftw0q,58,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/xftw0q/from_texting_daily_to_no_contact_in_36_hours_how/,AnxiousAttachment,1

476,Being in a relationship with someone who’s secure has allowed me to work on my anxiety (update)," Hi all! I wanted to share my experience with this lovely community and provide a bit of an update to my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/qzj5ul/i_think_i_did_it_i_found_someone_whos_secure/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) .


My boyfriend (25M) and I (26F) have  been officially dating for about 2.5 months.  We met back in October for our first date.  


Of course, it’s still the honeymoon period of our relationship.  But as many of you can understand, the honeymoon period can fill an AA person with anxiety (especially when you’re dating someone who’s avoidant).


The early parts (ahem.. well.. most parts) of a relationship were always a roller coaster for me.  I could see red flags, but I’d ignore them.  I’d recognize that I wasn’t getting what I wanted (more attention and clear communication), but settled thinking it’s normal to not have all my needs met.


It’s baffling how different the beginning of this relationship has been.  My anxiety isn’t being activated.  We communicate about everything, so there’s rarely anything for me to “spin out” over.  Every time I let him know what I like/my needs he meets them.  He doesn’t act like the small things I’m requesting are a big deal.  We also talked about attachment styles and confirmed that he is secure.


And as a result?  I’m learning to control my anxiety and stop my thoughts before they get out of control.  I’ve been able to say to myself “hey stop thinking that, there’s no reason to be worried about it”.  For the first time I feel this sense of calm in my life and I’m not worried (well not worried most of the time!).  For the first time I feel like I have a partner that is completely a source of comfort, not anxiety.  I finally feel like I’m in a place to work on my issues with anxiety because I’m not overwhelmed by it right now.


I’ve also noticed a big change in myself while in a relationship.  My BF and I have said “I love you” to one another.  In the past, I have told my partner that I love them several times a day.  In my previous relationships I’d use saying “I love you” as a tool to get some of the attention I desired when I was being ignored.  I also said it when I needed reassurance about our relationship.  I’ve noticed now, I only say “I love you” when I feel an intense need to.  We “say” I love you in so many other ways, so I don’t need as much reassurance anymore.  I know how he feels and I don’t feel the need to use it as a tool anymore.  As a result, saying “I love you” feels immensely more special now.  


Anyways, thank you for reading.  I know how hard it is for us AA people.  We don’t have to settle for being in relationships with avoidant people who don’t meet our needs.  Surrounding yourself with secure people (both romantic relationships and platonic) really can allow you to work on yourself and overcome your anxiety.",shy0ed,59,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/shy0ed/being_in_a_relationship_with_someone_whos_secure/,AnxiousAttachment,1

479,Thinking about my attraction to others,"So, I had this thought and would love some feedback. I came out of a relationship with someone avoidant 5 months ago, and have had many revelations in my work on myself since. One including thinking back on men I've been attracted to in the past who have always been pretty distant and emotionally unavailable. I'm a couples therapist and I realized today that once I find out a male in a partnership I'm treating is avoidant or displaying these tendencies, I'm instantly intrigued. Not in a physically unethical way, but more so they become pretty interesting to me especially the more I learn about their childhood and where it comes from.
Now, of course, therapists are naturally inquisitive people and this is such a gift for my work. But it can obviously present some challenges in my personal dating life as an anxious attacher (working towards secure!). And it's not that secure men bore me or aren't attractive. Rather, my thought today was this: am I somehow drawn to the fact that avoidant men are super independent and don't need much from others because I internally feel a lot of shame for having needs? Because my needs have actually made me feel ""needy."" It was a huge trigger in my recent relationship because my ex did call me needy and dramatic for having the most basic needs. Does this resonate with anyone? I'm trying to be more aware of why I'm attracted to certain people and I think this could be a huge factor reflecting something in me.",14v96ki,56,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/14v96ki/thinking_about_my_attraction_to_others/,AnxiousAttachment,1

481,"2 weeks ago she said she loved me and was committed - then she broke up with me and said she wants to find herself - I'm traumatized, whiplashed, and so lost... None of it makes sense.","I met a girl in January, and we dated intensely for 3.5ish months. During our time, a lot of traumas and baggage from her surfaced in our relationship. She told me multiple times during our time together, ""I am scared,""... and ""what happens after the honeymoon when the real things set in."" and ""I'm afraid because this feels like the real deal.""

She had a few patterns of withdrawing, starting arguments, pushing me away, and then coming back. A couple weeks ago, she asked for space after an argument, and I gave it to her. A few days later she called me and said ""I have never felt this way about anyone before, I know what I want with you. I want to be official and exclusive. I'm not talking to or dating anyone else and I hope you would tell me if you were as well."" I told her I wanted the same things. We reconciled, and spent the next 4 nights together.

On the last day together, she became passive aggressive, and a bit verbally mean. Later that night, I texted her to check in and asked how she was feeling after all the time together. She said that she was still fearful, and in her head, and told me she thinks that we should take a break. I asked her why, after the week we just had and she said ""I just think we butt heads. I just moved here (she did just move here 4 months prior, but this was something I addressed multiple times early on before we got involved asking her if she's sure she wants to date because she just moved), and she also said ""I don't know if I should involve you in my trauma/shit (this was the 2nd or 3rd time she's said this while distressed.""

I told her ""I feel like you are pushing me away and I'm trying to make solutions for us and work through things. Do you want to break up with me?"" and she said ""I think this is best."" I asked her to please take a few days to sleep on it and not make a snap decision while distressed and emotions were high and she agreed to take a week of space.

A week later she told me that she had peace in her heart and knew this was the right decision. She said things kept coming up for her from her past that she thought she worked through. She said that she was still hurt from some of our arguments. She said she just moved to a new city and feels this is the best decision for us both. She told me that I was the first person she ever felt that she could be herself with completely, no smoke and mirrors, and that she's never felt so seen by anyone in her entire life.

She said that she wants to commit to herself, and after reflecting, wants to date herself and come into herself (find herself). She said I opened her up to the person she wants to continue being.

I'm devastated. I absolutely loved this girl, and just two weeks prior she told me ""I've never felt this way about anyone before and know I want to be with you."" With no incidents, she 180d less than week later and now we are in no contact.

I don't know what to do right now. I feel traumatized. This feels like a huge whiplash. I feel like I lost my best friend, and we had just told each other how deeply we felt and are committed.

I'm still analyzing and trying to make sense of the breakup. Did her trauma and baggage get in the way? Are all of these excuses? Is there someone else in the picture? Did I push her away? How did she lose feelings so quickly? I can't make any sense of this. I let her go and wished her the best. But I'm absolutely crushed.

I don't understand how this can happen. Is this because of her attachment/trauma/insecurities? Is she running because she's scared? How can someone go from all in to pulling the rug and saying they don't want to date anyone and need to find themselves.

I'm so lost and don't know what to do. I'm still holding on to so much false hope that she'll change her mind and come back and want to continue. It feels like she went from extreme swing to all in and loving me, to shutting her feelings off and being done with me almost overnight. I can't make any sense of this, and it's really hard for me to let her go.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mind:- Was this her trauma/baggage that I lost to?- Is she avoidant/fearful avoidant?

\- Did I drive her away? Is this my fault?

\- Is she lying to me? Does she just want to be single?

\- Where did her feelings go? How could she give up on us so easily after committing like that?

\- Why did she 180 and pull the rug, after I reciprocated the love? She told me she loved me and wanted to be with me and I said the same and then she dumped me?

\- Should I move on? How do I get her back? Will she change her mind? What the HELL happened.  


  
I'm really confused and distressed right now everyone. This feels like such an extreme loss. Not only does it feel like I've been abandoned and rejected (core wounds), I'm feeling deep shame and lack of worthiness. I really wanted this to work and thought I found the one.

487,The most PAINFUL aspect of the Anxious/Avoidant cycle,"Often times, there was a genuine relationship. I remember the first few months without fault, they were soft-spoken, nice, apologetic, considerate and we both had the time of our lives together with strong bonds.

Then gradually they began to shift into an entirely different person as their insecurities and trauma were triggered. A secure person tends to leave the relationship when the other fails to follow up on their affection--especially if they become rude. But to the AP with their co-dependant programming, they will see this dysfunction from the other person and will instead attempt to fix it and shift it back to the person they originally loved.

A rule I always recommend following is believing people will never change. You can't save someone else, you can't make someone a better person, you can only remove yourself from the situation. Unless the person has proven to be aware and capable of changing, you must leave any unavailable partners because you will only be subjecting yourself to pain and they won't care, because they have no motivation to change.

These people will NEVER change unless they face consequences for their actions, 'fixing' them is keeping this from them, they need to have the realization that they have no one and that it is because of their own behaviour, for change to even become a possibility.

As anxious people, we need to learn that we must set boundaries and forbid any toxic people in our lives. The hardest part about it is that it is often a subtle switch, and from someone we consider to be trustworthy and loving.",v9hnsh,56,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/v9hnsh/the_most_painful_aspect_of_the_anxiousavoidant/,AnxiousAttachment,1

Why do they just disappear for short periods of time (hours/days)instead of permanently ending things. 

in my experience as soon as I suggest we break up they’re like wait no don’t leave. But they’ve already been emotionally distant where it feels like we aren’t in a relationship anyway. So what’s the difference to them. 

I know Anxious types don’t break up so easily bc we are the chasers usually and have hope for the relationship and are more willing to work on it and we fear being abandoned or rejected. 

But if an avoidants fear is being smothered and their partner clearly “smothers” them (by their definition and perspective) then why don’t they just cut it off.",sz9omm,56,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/sz9omm/why_dont_avoidants_just_leave/,AnxiousAttachment,1

492,Is anyone else’s anxious attachment style preventing them from getting into relationships?,"Out of the last 5 guys I’ve dated casually or had talking stages with for a few months, I’ve been eventually rejected by all. I can really only identify emotionally unavailability in one of them. For the other 4, I truly think that I was the problem. This spans over the course of the last couple of years (I didn’t date during the pandemic, so there is a large gap).

My friends are always telling me “it’s not you, it’s them” but when you keep getting rejected for a relationship over and over, you have to think at some point that you may be the problem. They haven’t been in the trenches there with me, in our text messages, on our dates, etc. When I start liking a guy, I chase HARD and become super needy and clingy. I think what happens is that they can smell my desperation and decide they do not want to be in a relationship with me. I have the self-awareness to realize that I’m doing this, but when the next guy comes along, I kind of forget and do it all over again, especially if I’m really infatuated. Every single guy starts off liking me as well — not to toot my own horn, but when my anxious attachment is not at play, I have a really awesome, outgoing personality. Then over time, I become an insecure stage 5 clinger and they eventually say to me “I’m not looking for a relationship right now” (and then I usually see them get into a relationship with someone else a little while later).

I am nearly in my 30s and have never been in an official relationship because of this. I just got rejected by a guy I really liked after we had talked for a few months. At first, he really liked me too, and I am almost positive he lost feelings when my neediness and clinginess kept coming into play. I’m not over him and I keep wondering if there’s anything I can do to undo the damage, but it’s likely too late, as it always is.

Don’t really care to hear “those guys weren’t right for you” — because I truly believe that if I wasn’t so anxiously attached, they potentially could have been. I just keep sabotaging with my behavior.

494,"Healing and Sex: Once finally free of the addictive push-pull, emotional rollercoaster of the anxious-avoidant trap- how did your relationship to sex change?","Sorry for long post.

Tldr: anxious attachment and used sex for validation. Since starting healing journey sex drive is lower. How to heal my relationship to sex?

I've had an anxious attachment most of my life but I've spent the last 3-4 years healing. My life has changed for the better in so many ways. 
I finally don't feel this deep lonely pain inside of me. It used to feel like a crying baby lived in my chest and needed attention from others for comfort. I dated the classic avoidant types over and over. My longest relationship ended after 3 years and it broke me and triggered all my attachment wounds and childhood trauma. 

So I learned about attachment styles, trauma, I meditated, did psychedelics, cold showers but most of my healing really was thanks to my group therapist who taught me about non-duality. I have warmer, closer friendships now and have met a secure, kind, warm, and loving partner.



Since healing began I've learned a lot about myself- specifically that I used sex as a way to feel loved. Even if it was with someone I just met our someone who treated me badly. It was an addiction.
 That crying baby inside of me would be soothed for a week or so after a hookup but then I was back to needing the attention, the release of dopamine and serotonin. 
In the midst of my healing my libido disappeared. At first I wanted to blame the lockdown and pandemic since they did overlap. 

But my sex drive still hasn't come back full swing. Maybe it's because now I'm in my late twenties instead of my early twenties. But I don't know what sex means to me now that I'm not using it to fill a void or soothe my insecure, anxious attachment wounds. I don't feel intensely horny like I used to. I even masturbate less. I don't find myself fawning over attractive people like I used to. If I do have a ""sex dream"" it's just me masturbating. No lovers. 

I love my current boyfriend so much but our relationship is secure. Sure we have disagreements but I don't feel insecure and worried about whether or not he loves me or will leave me. 
I think I was addicted to the highs and lows of being in insecurely attached relationships, where sex was the physical and sometimes only verification of any kind of relationship or care. 

Can anyone else who is/was anxiously attached relate to having this unhealthy relationship to sex? How do we heal and move forward physically?

495,Are anxiously attached people especially prone to self-development?,"Here I don't mean self-development in a healthy sense like when you chase your goals and develop yourself in the meantime, I mean this kind of toxic self-development when you always try to become better because you feel like you as you are is not good enough. 

Since I was 14 I've been reading books like «be the best version of yourself» or «the secrets of superproductivity» because I felt like I need to always better myself in order to be «normal». And now when I feel stressed, I tend not to do something pleasant for myself like go for a walk or draw, I open some youtube videos about how to become better in some way. When I went to therapy, I realized that my problem is that I am not accepting myself and view myself as only a raw material for development. 

Don't get me wrong, self-development can be a very good thing, but there is definitely a line after which this way of relating to yourself becomes harmful, preventing you from accepting yourself as you are, in this non-ideal humanly way. There is always room for improvement, but improvement shouldn't be the only goal.

499,Had a long session w my new therapist last night and I think she finally got through to me,"I wanted to share what she told me in case it helps anyone else here right now. I’m currently feeling distant from the guy I’m dating since he’s very preoccupied w other real life stressors and responsibilities which has caused me to pretty much be constantly activated for the past like 6 days. (What she told me is only relevant in shorter term dating, I don’t know if this can apply in longer serious relationships)

I am so preoccupied with worrying if someone likes me. I’m always trying to do the right thing to impress a guy and make him want me. I’m afraid of communicating and voicing my opinions or saying what I need because I’m afraid it’ll push him away. She told me that way of thinking needs to be reframed because I am giving the other person WAY too much power and neglecting my own needs entirely. I know it’s a big trait of AA to think this way. She recommended I think “I’m so worried about if he likes me..do I really like him?” “I’m worried about trying to impress him but has he tried to impress me?” “I’m afraid to communicate in fear of pushing him away…but do I want someone who will be pushed away when I communicate?” She said think of dating as gathering data. You can work on building a connection but you need to remind yourself it’s all about YOU finding your person. Someone you not only like, but someone who is right for you and giving you what you need. You deserve to get what you need. And sometimes we’re quick to blame our anxieties and think that we are overthinking. Or sometimes we ignore things thinking it’s only our AA that has us triggered but we forget that there is a chance our needs just simply aren’t being met and that’s OK! It’s not always the chance so I recommend you reflect on your own situation before thinking that way, but a lot of the time the anxiety is justifiably triggered. 

Thinking that way really takes the power back from people and has already calmed me down a lot. It’s forcing me to think about what I really need and being more in tune with myself.

502,A Lasting Relationship Isn't Guaranteed (A Healing Moment In My Journey),"I've had an epiphany today. I wanted to share it with this group. I'm hoping it might help others as well. I tried to word this title the best that I could. 

I know for us AP's the unknown is very scary to us. Apart from FA/AP attachment, I also suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Disorder. The unknown is very triggering to us anxious folk. 

I feel like I have had a healing moment towards more secure attachment. I started journaling last week, but have really been thinking about that journal entry that I wrote. 

A lasting relationship is not guaranteed, and we simply have no control over how it's gonna end. We can do the work, yes. Our partner can do the work, yes, but we still have no control over the situation because many factors can cause a relationship to end, and a relationship has two or more (if we are talking non-monogamy or polyamory here too.) people involved. 

Relationships can end at any time. You could be together for 2 years, 4 years, 6 years, 10 years, 30 years, etc, and have it end suddenly. Your partner could decide that they want different things, or you have a incompatibility that is not resolveable, or your partner has an affair, finds out they are gay or lesbian, or if bisexual, wants to be with someone of their own gender, your partner could become abusive, and finally, your partner could die suddenly in a car accident, or in the army, or have a terminal illness, etc. Many factors could cause a relationship to end. A relationship lasting is simply not guaranteed. 

Another healing moment that I had was understanding that it is not healthy or secure to work on a relationship 24/7. In a relationship, you should also let go, have fun and enjoy your partner's company. Like I've said, a lasting relationship isn't guaranteed, and it's also important to have a relationship with ourselves as well. 

I'm currently with my SA/DA boyfriend of a year and 3 months, and while I love him very much, and he's my first love, I also understand that we might not last someday and that I'll be okay if we don't. I want us to last, but I am letting go some. I can't control the outcome. I just want to build a strong bond, and enjoy the time I do have with him, because a lasting relationship isn't guaranteed.",tyk5rq,56,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/tyk5rq/a_lasting_relationship_isnt_guaranteed_a_healing/,AnxiousAttachment,1
503,A group specifically focus on secure attachment,"Hey fellow APs! For a while I've been thinking about creating a group/club for people who want to focus specifically on understanding, recognizing and familiarising themselves with *secure* attachment, as opposed to only understanding their own insecure attachment. Basically, as I've been becoming more secure, I started reading more about secure behaviours and what a secure attachment style actually looks like. Consuming this information has helped me in my journey to being more secure because I am less preoccupied by insecurity and more focused on what I want to be, which is secure. I believe that making yourself aware of what you're actually working towards can help the healing process.

Basically, at some point you read so much about anxious or avoidant styles that you end up forgetting that the goal is to heal and be secure, not to have buckets of information on the anxious and avoidant trap without actually knowing what the healthier alternatives are.

It's for that reason I created the Becoming Secure group. Soon I hope to make it a Zoom or discord thing but to gauge response, we will start with Reddit first.

The sub is r/becomingsecure

PS:
this is not a personal ad and I do not stand to benefit anything personally!!! This is just something I created because I feel it can really help APs (and any insecure attachment for that matter).

But this is a supprt group for APs and my story is an example of when the anxious/avoidant trap becomes abnormal and borderline abusive.**

*Trigger warnings: THREAT OF VIOLENCE, EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION AND POTENTIAL ABUSE*

I want to share my story of my two year relationship with my DA boyfriend. I'm doing so for two reasons:

1. My therapist advised me to journal my memories and remind myself of all the reasons I was unhappy as a way of staying focused on my goal of walking away. Writing things out helps me to process things better.
2. Because I want to share my story with all of you in case it inspires someone else who might be going through a similar dance (as I assume most of us in this sub are or have been). Sometimes it can be hard to realise just how bad our situation is until we see it written down. It's easy to feel alone when you're in the anxious/avoidant dance because avoidants have a very good way of simultaneously keeping you hooked while also making you feel like shit. I hope my story shows you that you are not alone.

*Maybe you can see some of your own situation within my story.*

Some events might be triggering or disturbing for some of you.

I entered the relationship with my predominant attachment style being secure. I had anxious tendencies but these were very manageable plus I led an active lifestyle so I barely had time to be preoccupied anyways. My first impression of him was that he was secure also. He pursued me more than I pursued him and we hit it off. The relationship seemed to be progressing nicely and within three months we were ""official"". The DA tendencies showed themselves shortly after that. Here are some examples of things I've had to go through over the last two years:

1. Two/three months into the relationship: I suggested he throw a birthday party for his 25th birthday since it's such a milestone age. He agreed. The smoking gun? He wasn't sure if he wanted to invite me because he didnt want his friends to know we were a couple. I was just, in his words, ""a girl I'm seeing and who knows whether we will work out or not?"". I rationalized this because it had only been two months and so I figured he wasn't ready. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that he was somewhat ashamed of me and this hurt because we spent A LOT of time together and he knew that my friends knew about him. I was eventually invited to the party but only because he ""felt bad"" for me.

2. When we became official: even though he was 24 when we started dating, he never had a relationship last longer than 6 months. He is a very good looking, athletic and charming guy. He is smart, takes care of himself and is quite independent so I found it hard to believe that he never had a long term girlfriend before. His reasoning? ""I never really found someone who actually kept my attention. They always seemed to have flaws I couldn't handle and they always wanted something serious while I just wanted to keep it casual."" He also spoke in a very dismissive manner about his exes and one ex in particular, he described her as being ""pretty and kind but really annoying and I only ever wanted to see her once a week"".

3. Nine months into the relationship, the first time he snapped at me: his mood had been off the whole day. He was very cold and distant towards me and was pretty harsh in his tone. I couldn't figure out what was wrong and each time I tried to talk to him, he would barely answer. We were driving to the gym and he had his headphones in full blast listening to some podcast. I tried to speak to him and that's when he snapped. ""Can't I just listen to something without being bothered?! Do we have to talk?! What do you want?"" I had never seen him like this before. I had to hold back my tears until we got to the gym and I cried in the bathroom. Afterwards, the coldness continued but this time it came with dismissive comments and passive aggression. Later that night, he acted like nothing was wrong and started being extra nice to me and even cuddled me in bed. He slept like a baby. I didn't sleep that night. These random days of coldness and distance happened more and more as the months past and became much closer in occurrence. From once every couple of weeks to every other day (the first COVID lockdown didn't make things any better, only worse. Each day felt like I was walking on egg shells). His need for space grew and grew with each day, week or month, and it got to the point where I would be afraid to even ask him if he wanted to do something as simple as cook together. He's snapped at me a few times since then but it hasn't happened in a while. *The worst was when he gave me the silent treatment for two days because his cousin joked about us getting married and me being part of the family* Even then, I ended up being the one to apologise to him. I was so distressed by the silent treatment, I apologised because I wanted it to stop.

4. Throughout the whole relationship, I have this constant feeling that I'm negotiating my worth. Each and every interaction is some sort of negotiation for time spent together. Whether its picking what to watch on TV, what we will do for the weekend or even what to have for dinner. Anything that requires closeness with me, he always finds a way to make it difficult. He never wants to go on vacation together. He claims he prefers to travel alone yet he has travelled with friends and family and even a female friend. But with me, he always finds reasons why it won't work or why he wont want to do it. The few small trips we have taken, I have planned and paid for them. And even then, he always found something to complain about. That's another thing; he is always willing to do things with others that he is never willing to do with me. It really hurts feeling like I am some kind of enemy or afterthought.

5. He has a never changing attitude towards our future and recently did something that made me realise that breaking up was the best thing (read my previous post as I don't have the strength to write it out again). One example I will give though is when he told me how much he wanted us to get married and have children. Later on, he told me he regretted saying it and should not have said it because he was ""just horny"". I cried my eyes out after that. Another time he once again told me he wanted us to have a future together. Later on, he said that's ""not what I meant and besides, you're more sure of these things than me"". Which simply wasn't true.

6. He puts me down in front of people. Whether its off hand remarks or stupid jokes, he puts me down quite a lot. This especially happens when I am the center of attention. I'm very social and, as my friends and family put it, I have a welcoming energy. So it's not out of the ordinary for me to be some sort of a people magnet. I've also had it that some people open up to me about their deepest secrets within minutes of meeting me. My therapist has described me as an empath so maybe that's where it comes from. I'm saying this not to make myself look good but for this reason: my boyfriend doesn't like it. The more compliments and attention I get, the more he puts me down. All the nice things people say about me, are the things he makes fun of or ignores. So you can imagine how much damage that has done to my self-esteem. Worse is that he sometimes picks at some flaws of mine and one time told me he wouldn't want to live together because we do things different and he would be more irritated by me.

7. He used to compare me to other women (in a very backhanded way that it wouldn't be obvious to a more oblivious person). Not often but when he did, he compared me to a specific type he used to date before me; I was not his usual type and he made that very clear to me. The only reason he stopped was because I told him to cut it out. This is one of the few times I ever had the courage to stand up to him.

8. It took me a year before I finally had the guts to tell my friends and family just how badly I was being treated. All of them want me to get out (when everyone in your life wants you to leave someone, take that seriously).

9. He threatened to be beat me up if he ever caught me cheating on him. He often would just threaten to dump me if ever did something like pick a fight with him, yell at him etc. His favourite sentence ""if did x I would kick you out"" or ""end things"". But the threat of violence was the smoking gun that made me realise just how dire my situation was. This is what made me truly afraid of him.

All of this turned me from secure to AP. But I was a silent AP. I didn't have the luxury of engaging in obvious protest behaviours because I was so afraid of him. As a result, I internalised my feelings and remained silent. I became a shell of my real self and it's taken a few months of therapy (which I attend secretly so he doesn't question me) for me to start to feel my worth again. I am now preparing to leave and I should be done with him within a couple of weeks (purely logistics). After that, I will stay with my friends and then go back to my family. I will start the process of rebuilding my life all over again.

I'm very sorry if this was triggering for some of you. But I want you to know that you are not alone and you DESERVE BETTER. This kind of treatment is not normal and in some cases it can be very abusive. Let go and start again; that's much more rewarding than staying with someone who treats you like you're worthless all in the name of love.

Take care.",nfaitq,55,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/nfaitq/if_youre_considering_leaving_your_da_partner_read/,AnxiousAttachment,1
505,I did it :))))) goodbye DA!,"My bf was an angel among the stars like genuinely the most perfect fucking human to exist.. my best friend I never thought I needed. But over the year, certain external events started happening and his avoidance got bad… all the way up to us not speaking for over a month & him thinking that was acceptable. 

I communicated tirelessly and tried to ignore the truth of the matter, but soon enough it caught up to me - he did not have the capacity to be the man I needed him to be, to show up and do the work and be present with me. He was in denial too although it was obvious to us both that life was so overwhelming he couldn’t handle a girlfriend. 

So I did it. Over IG but with him not communicating in so long, I just had to. It was clear that breaking up was in his best interest, but it was hard for him to accept it was over but he completely understood and said he couldn’t give me what I wanted and he loved me. I left the door open but also told him I couldn’t really leave the door open fully or else I’d wait for him forever and that wouldn’t be fair to me. 

I feel like I betrayed him by choosing myself over him. But I also feel at peace. Time and weed will help. But I can rest easy knowing I did not self sacrifice time and time again. My boyfriend is amazing, I truly believed that if he had his life more together when we met, we could’ve gotten married. But these are the cards we were dealt and you owe it to yourself to find the relationship of your dreams.",11whioq,53,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11whioq/i_did_it_goodbye_da/,AnxiousAttachment,1
506,how I personally put a stop to anxious spirals,"Just want to preface this by saying this may not work for everyone, this is what works for me and I'm hoping this might help someone else. 

How I put a stop to anxious spirals is by calling out my own distorted thoughts first. Is what I'm thinking even true? Does it have a basis in reality or am I projecting? 

For example, I didn't receive a text back. My first reaction is to catastrophize. I think ""they must hate me"", ""they're talking to someone else"" etc. I have to challenge those projections and ask myself all of the more realistic reasons why someone might not reply. And out of all those reasons, the most common ones are: they're busy, they're tired, they're depressed, or they just want to be alone. None of those have anything to do with me. 

Secondly, I have to assess if the person is actually throwing up red flags. Some people actually ARE playing games with you and this is where I have to have good discernment. If the person is acting inconsistent and fickle, I know they're playing games. And I always remind myself this is not my fault and this is *their problem*. 

People who go around looking for ego boosts are insecure, and are preying on other insecure people. I notice if someone is going way too far with flattering me, it makes me anxious and it's a sign they're toxic. People who use others for an ego boost (and aren't clear about it, because let's be real, everyone wants attention and that's okay lol. It becomes a problem when they're taking actions to make you become attached to them while they stay detached from you. It's because they want power over someone else's feelings to supplement their own lack of genuine internal self worth)

Are energy vampires. Which leads me to my next point, take your power back by starving vampires. Dont let them  ""suck your blood"" (aka don't give them attention they want) and don't take their game playing personally. I'm a bit petty and prideful, so what stops me from doing things like double texting and begging for attention is knowing that 1, I'm going to feel used and shitty after and 2, I don't want to inflate the ego of someone who doesn't deserve it. Sometimes our loved ones do need that ego boost but if they're just taking advantage of it to feel powerful, they don't deserve that. 

Now if someone is being inconsistent and they *aren't* playing games. It's time for direct and honest communication. Ofc you want to ask if they're okay (because like I said earlier they could genuinely be depressed) and let them know you're there for them if they need support. 

Last, avoid personalizing rejection. One thing that helps me is not blaming anyone. It's not other people's fault if they don't like me. They can't control that and I shouldn't expect other people to compromise themselves just to soothe my own ego. I remember all the times I've disliked other people, and I didn't even KNOW why I didn't like them. I just didn't. Other people probably feel the same way about me and that's okay. 

The biggest part about anxious spirals is the physical pains that come with it. So I'll be getting into that now. When this happens I just have to sit with it sometimes I feel nauseous, tired, I lose my appetite, I can't sleep. Taking conscious steps to soothe that anxiety slowly helps. For me I like to lie on my back, put one hand over my heart to feel how fast it's beating, and my other hand over my diaphragm. 

Usually when I'm anxious I'm breathing very shallowly, taking slow deep breaths will help slow your heart rate. I've done things like hugging myself (which actually does help, touching your own skin and hugging yourself releases oxytocin). Taking a warm bath after this has helped. And journaling my feelings while I'm spiraling has helped. 

It takes time to learn how to deal with anxious spirals, one big thing is to have compassion for yourself. You're anxious for a reason, it doesn't mean you're weak. It doesn't mean you're crazy. It means that you're afraid and dysregulated at the moment and it's okay. Everyone deals with anxiety one way or another. Shame and repressing your feelings will make every thing 10x worse

So don't rag on yourself and say ""I'm so stupid, I just need to get over this"". If it were that easy, you would've done that by now lol. Take it easy, be gentle with yourself, and give yourself time. 

I hope this helps, sorry for how long this post is but I thought I'd share what helps me!",10xtgn5,54,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10xtgn5/how_i_personally_put_a_stop_to_anxious_spirals/,AnxiousAttachment,1
507,"my ex bf is in a relationship and its okay, I guess...?","I found out through social media that my ex bf has a new girlfriend and he is on vacation with friends like we used to do. When I saw the pictures of them (all six together), I didn't feel anything. I wasn't sad, I wasn't angry. A few hours later, I wrote down some thoughts I had and some conclusions I made. (I blocked him and deleted all his friends from social media, a friend was browsing through instagram and that's how I found out.

* I'm afraid that he and his friend will shit talk and gossip about me --> I still need to be *the good girl*, I still need to work to be not a people pleaser
* I'm afraid that somethings wrong with me. He is in a new relationship with someone who loves him and he takes her already on vacation with his friends, I feel replaced 
* I still hoped deep down our mutual friends would tell him how happy I am and what I'm up to --> I need to live for myself more
* It hurts, realizing you're not important to a person anymore. --> I'm egocentric and I need to work on it.
* It hurts he can move on like nothing happened with someone new, while I'm still hurting because of things he said or did. --> I need to find ways to let these things go.
* It's his work colleague I shouldn't worry about, even after we broke up and were trying to get back together. I was so anxious about him leaving for her I couldn't sleep. I actually joked the last we saw each other he would date his work colleague because she would understand his workaholism. --> Maybe I wasn't always out of line and was right about some things and *he* made me feel like I was crazy. 
* When I look at pictures of him, even old ones, I don't feel anything. I'm indifferent. It feels like I don't know this person anymore. I feel so far away from him --> maybe I'm really moving on.

It gets better. I had a feeling he had someone new (we broke off in the beginning of September for good). I guess it wasn't a big surprise for me buuuut I really thought I would cry and be sad. But I wasn't.

I broke with someone who didn't want to be with me. And that's fine. This isn't a loss.   
I sleep better, I eat better, my skin is better, I'm calmer because I'm not stressed all the time. I was anxious because deep down, I knew he didn't see a future with me but I didn't see it at that moment. I hold on something that already was long gone. He was long gone. 

I'm over him, I guess, but I'm not over *it*. There are some situations that still hurt and affect me, that's why I'm not dating.

**But I'm healing and you will too. It really does get better.**",101kg2g,55,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/101kg2g/my_ex_bf_is_in_a_relationship_and_its_okay_i_guess/,AnxiousAttachment,1

509,NEEDS,"A few days ago I went back to reading *Love Me, Don't Leave Me: Overcoming Fear of Abandonment and Building Lasting, Loving Relationships by Michelle Skeen* and I came across some statements that would serve a lot of people in this sub when they feel like their needs are unmet. It goes like this;

- Is your need in reference or response to a ""now"" situation? Or is it weighted down by it packed in with a need for reassurance that went unmet for two decades? How much are you asking for? Based upon the duration and depth of your relationship, is your need in the moment and realistic? Or is it in the past with memories of not getting the care, reassurance, love, or understanding that you longed to receive?

The above made me look back at my past relationships and I realized that most of my needs were as a result of me not getting what I needed in the past as a child & teenager from my parent & in my relationships with my past partners. I'd just carry it forward to the next relationship. Simply put, a lot of times I wasn't living in the moment. I used my past experiences in my new Relationships which was unhealthy.

She continues to say;
 ""You may feel like you've experienced a lifetime of unmet needs. The gap between your needs and having them met might be significant. The bigger the space, the more room there is for pain, anger, frustration, resentment, sadness, loneliness & dissapointment."" 

And finally;
""There isn't one person, One situation, or one new skill that will eliminate all of these feelings. They are part of your life experience. They will continue to show up when you get triggered""

So, self-awareness is important here. Identifying whether your reaction is from a past experience or a present one is the only way to move forward. For those working towards a secure attachment, I hope these words are helpful. That movie/trauma you experienced years ago, stopped. You have the opportunity to shoot a new movie on your own terms & your own time. You're the script writer, director and producer right now. All the crew in your past movies is gone.

510,The two things that have helped my journey towards secure(r) attachment,"On another thread I mentioned this and thought I'd put it as a separate post. I thought about the two things which have helped the most in getting out of the anxious headspace (obviously i'm not all the way there!) 

&#x200B;

1. STOP ENTERTAINING AVOIDANTS. Learn to recognise them early on; once you start doing that, you find their predictable behaviours funny rather than intriguing. Now I can spot avoidants from a mile off and never interact with them romantically. (think someone who will say 'I always forget to text people back' 'I can go days without speaking to anyone!' 'I like feeling the energy / vibes and seeing how things go') - like YDY avoidant babes, but to my anxiouses THIS IS NOT **FOR** **YOU**. PUT IT DOWN.
2. Boundaries, boundaries and fucking boundaries. Literally explain, unemotionally and upfront, what you would like, if the other person thinks it's reasonable, and if not, see if you can meet in the middle somewhere. Stop hiding your needs and pretending to be chill. For example, I will say: ""It would be helpful for me if we could have an idea of when the next date is going to be at the end of the date, otherwise I will worry myself sick that you're going to disappear."" (this is obviously for a little further down in dating not after 1 / 2 dates). Or ""I find a daily text check in very reassuring, is that something you can do?""",ovqvx0,52,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ovqvx0/the_two_things_that_have_helped_my_journey/,AnxiousAttachment,1

512,practice “acting” secure,"i 23f have been anxious attached all of my life. i was raised by a narcissistic father and long story short, it turned me into a codependent person. in my teens i was very insecurely attached to my friends too. today i was talking to my therapist about how i “grew” out of that insecure feeling towards my friends by practicing not acting on my insecure impulses and she asked me why not try “acting” more secure with my partner? 
she had me think of a very secure attachment i have and that for me is my relationship with my best friend. she asked me what i do in my relationship with my partner that i don’t do with my best friend and that a secure person wouldn’t do. 
so i’ve picked two things i will be working towards eliminating in order to feel more secure by acting more secure! 

i will stop checking to see if he’s online. i do this almost compulsively every time i open instagram. 

and i will stop trying to see who he’s recently followed on instagram. 

i’m keeping track of how often i do these things in my notes app just to become aware of it and if i do “slip up” and do one of these compulsions, then i will forgive myself and practice self compassion and try again!",lsq7hy,54,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/lsq7hy/practice_acting_secure/,AnxiousAttachment,1
513,Stuff that’s been helping me heal <3,"- My healthy coping mechanisms: cleaning, showering, talking to myself, writing about it and then writing the calm and rational side right next to it when I’m ready, breathing exercises, setting a time in the day that I can worry for a set amount of time, getting to bed at a good time
- my coping mechanisms that are kind of avoidant and maybe unproductive but can work in a pinch because I deserve to feel calm and sometimes things are too overwhelming: talking to a friend, communicating with my partner, playing video games, watching tv/tiktok
- I made a 100% private Instagram that I made into a vision board for my healing + my inner child. No one follows me. I follow accounts that post helpful resources and info about what I’m going through and I also follow an account that posts pretty pictures and one that posts children’s book illustrations. I post pictures that make me feel calm and safe and happy, photos of myself as a kid, art I’ve made, art I like, screenshots of my boyfriend and friends and family texting me sweet things, and pictures of animals I love. It honestly helps a lot to have it all to look at and save posts that help me and have them all in the same place.  PS- I have lots of instagrams and even a few tiktok accounts I can recommend for you guys to follow if you want just let me know! 

Note: I only say talking to a friend is not one of my healthiest coping mechanisms because I’ve started to see it as what should be one of my last resorts in this healing process. don’t get me wrong, I still do it a lot. But I’m trying to cut back on the external validation and reassurance.

Will the anxiety hit me tomorrow morning before my eyes open? Maybe, but I just wanna say how proud I am for feeling okay. My last break up, I was sobbing on the floor for hours. Maybe it's because I had a feeling from the start that I wouldn't last with this guy. Whatever the reason is, I'm glad I feel okay.

515,I tried a new approach and it worked!,"I've been seeing this guy for the past few weeks, but I haven't been able to tell what's going on because I've been getting mixed vibes from him. When that happens, I feel incredibly anxious and get really awkward. I usually wait for the other person to make a move and then I reciprocate.

But I started realizing that people who are securely attached are comfortable putting their feelings out there and seeing how/whether the other person responds. I also realized that I might be coming across as uninterested or putting off mixed vibes of my own, which might be making it hard for this guy to feel comfortable. 

We had plans to hang out on New Year's Eve, so I decided to try opening up about myself and also put myself out there about how I was feeling. We went to a museum in the afternoon, and as we were talking about stuff, I told him about an important life experience that really shaped who I am. But instead of just talking about what happened, I let him see my feelings and how much it's affected me, which is really hard for me to do. 

Much later, when we were hanging out at his place, he just started talking about himself and really opening up. Which made it easier to ask about the mixed vibes I've been getting. We ended up talking for a really long time about our emotional styles, relationship experiences, and families. It was an amazing conversation!

516,Realizing how reactive I am to other people’s emotions,"There’s so much advice online to always “match the other person’s energy”, meaning when they withdraw or stop showing as much effort, you do the same to avoid overwhelming them or burning yourself out. And I believe this is generally good advice in certain instances. But recently I noticed that I was starting to take it too far and become almost malicious—like I wanted to punish the other person for withdrawing and not meeting my expectations. Which is of course insane and goes against everything I stand for. 

However, I was so wrapped up in fear and my attachment wounds that I couldn’t see how awful my intentions were becoming. Some people *need* to withdraw to keep themselves from unraveling especially if they’re going through a crisis or mental health issue. As much as we’d love to connect with them and give our support, they’re going to do their own thing at the end of the day. So we can either decide to give them space (while maintaining our boundaries: ex. asking them to tell you if they need to disappear for a bit) or we need to remove ourselves from the situation entirely. 

But don’t do what I used to do and allow your intentions to become malicious or turn into “protest behavior.” Do not become cold and aloof just because they are. Stay grounded but pull your energy back, focus on yourself, and let them decide if they want to come back. Withdraw out of respect for them (and yourself). Although if they’re going through something serious, don’t be afraid to show that you care without any pressure for them to respond/reciprocate. They likely will appreciate your efforts 💗 

Also Something I’ve recently started asking myself before I speak or send a text is *could I live with myself if this was the last message/thing I said to this person?* This doesn’t apply to abusive situations, just if someone happens to be avoidant or struggling to meet your needs. Each day you have to accept that you may never hear from them again. So this question has already helped me so much in making sure I’m not speaking from a reactive, anxious, or accusing place. Because more often than not, I wrongly assume the worst. However, the intention for this shouldn’t be to say the “right” thing to get them to stay with you. It should be to get to a place where you feel confident that you’re expressing yourself in a healthy, compassionate way AND staying true to your boundaries, because even if you never hear from this person again, at least you can walk away knowing that you stand by what you said.",16nysie,52,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/16nysie/realizing_how_reactive_i_am_to_other_peoples/,AnxiousAttachment,1

519,If your SO not replying quickly or frequently enough to your…,"…non-emergency texts (meaning no one’s life or property is in danger), causes you to behave anxiously or become emotionally distraught, it may be a sign that you’re becoming irrationally dependent on them.

If this is you, please take steps to heal and rebalance. No one but you can accomplish this. The healing must come from you.

This is not a judgement. It’s fairly normal to find ourselves becoming irrationally dependent on something. Like games, food, a habit, a routine, etc.

But when the object is a person, that irrational dependency can cause conflict. So it’s important to identify, acknowledge it, and work on healing it within ourselves.

Just like we can’t expect chocolate to participate in our healing from chocolate dependency, we also can’t expect our SO or friend to participate in our healing from our dependence on them.

Acknowledgment is the first step. Pay attention to how this post makes you feel in your body. If you feel resistance to it, take it as a sign that it probably applies to you, and try to acknowledge it.

Secure people gladly take ownership of their role in healing and rebalancing, and learning to regulate their emotions, so they don’t become irrationally dependent on others.

It’s not your SO’s treatment of texting that is causing your anxiety. It’s your unconscious ignoring of your dependency. You are ignoring you. Stop doing that. Pay attention to you.

Of course none of this applies to texting about legit emergencies.

If you have anxiety from someone not responding to an emergency text, that is not necessarily irrational dependency, but you should also be reaching out to and utilizing emergency services or other sources of assistance (not just your SO) if it’s truly urgent or an emergency.",12oknst,54,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/12oknst/if_your_so_not_replying_quickly_or_frequently/,AnxiousAttachment,1

521,Back yourself,"(Not sure if Americans use this phrase ""back yourself"", we (in the UK) use it like you would back a horse or company i.e. ""gamble/bet on yourself"".)

My relationship with a DA fell apart this year. We didn't date for that long, but it was honestly the most intense relationship of my life, it was this brilliant and warm cascade of getting to know one another's minds, I've honestly never clicked with someone so fast and so deeply before. Every conversation was like a joyful explosion as every tangent seemed to lead somewhere deep and novel, revealing internal and external truths at such a rapid pace I just couldn't keep up. It felt too good to be true and it was.

I got needy, she deactivated and completely withdrew for several months without any contact, I was honestly devastated, the first month or so I was just shell shocked, just going through the motions each day just to get through it. I felt as though I had lost something so unbelievably precious and beautiful and I felt completely hopeless in a way that I cannot ever remember feeling.

Eventually she got back in touch and said she was sorry for ghosting me for such a long time, we eventually met up and I found out that within the span of those months she had got back with and broken up with her ex and basically had something approximating a breakdown subsequently. I have to say, that when we met up again, even under the circumstances, the chemistry was so instant and obvious it was painful, but after hearing her story, I knew that, if only for my own self respect, that door was shut. Plus, she herself told me she realised she was simply not emotionally equipped for a relationship. I found being around her just made me unbearably sad and I let her know that I would prefer to go no contact.

But I still think back to how great those first months felt, and for the last few weeks, I've been ruminating a lot, like ""What we had was so special and incredible, and what if I never find it again? Maybe in a year or so, when she looks back and realises just how special and unique things were, she'll reach out again and maybe we can start again with a clean slate etc etc...""  But today, I was walking through the snow, turning these thoughts over in my head and at some point my brain just stopped and said to me ""Back yourself"". 

I'm so caught up in thinking whether or not I should bet my chips on HER, when the most important thing is to go all in on myself. I have to back myself to bounce back from this, I have to back myself that I can find a relationship that is not only loving and special but also healthy and stable, and most importantly, I have to back myself that I can *become* the kind of man that will attract this type of woman into my life.

522,The good in goodbye 🌸,"It’s so hard to walk away from someone that I liked, but couldn’t feel the same way about me. I’m continually surprised at how quickly I can develop feelings for others..it is so easy to neglect other responsibilities…maybe I need to be alone for a while. 

I’m grateful for the time I had with him. I felt like a teenager in love. Everything was like how I wished my firsts would be. I didn’t think I could be so attracted to someone. What we had made me happy while it lasted. 

I’m proud of myself for sticking to my boundaries. We never went past holding hands. I’m grateful he respected them when I made them known. 

I’m proud of myself from walking away from someone who was unsure of me. We wanted different things originally and I will not stick around to see if he’d change his mind (it might never have happened). 

While I’m disappointed I couldn’t be the one for him, I really enjoyed our time together. It’s only been a while since it ended, and I still have feelings for him. I wish him happiness and healing- he mentioned a few things that I know must have been hard for him.

524,"FA ex said all the ‘right’ things after NC, exactly as predicted.","For context, 2 1/2 months of no contact after I [AP] broke off a seven month situationship for hot/cold behavior and typical FA distancing. We’re in the same circle of friends so I knew once I started going back to my usual places I would see him, like two nights ago. He stuck to me like glue, only left my side to go to the bathroom. Any excuse to touch me, lean in super close to talk to me over the noise, kept telling me I looked great, said he missed something about us for the very first time. I mean, like ever. I’ve told him I missed him several times during those seven months and he rarely said it back. I mean, I was literally stunned he initiated that, especially since it was a really vulnerable thing to do. No, I didn’t say it back, and I’ve second guessed that decision more times than I care to admit. No, I did not tell him he also looked great. Twice he said he adored me over something, can’t remember what. 

Lots of physical closeness, lots of reminiscing. Offered to walk me to my car at the end of the night, and since I knew he was looking for an opening for more physical contact, I chose to say it wasn’t a good idea. We are pretty notorious for hours long makeout sessions in my car, especially since he stopped having sex with me many months ago because it was just too close. As desperate as I am for that physical contact with him, my brain was about a millimeter ahead of my heart and lady parts that night, thank goodness.

Also like tons of YouTube videos have noted he would likely do, I found out the next morning that a couple of weeks ago he asked a mutual friend where I was and what I was doing since I’ve had him blocked on all social media since I broke things off. On another night, when he overheard another mutual friend say my name, he started singing my praises, saying how great I was, blah blah blah. Then that friend told him he was a dumbass, lol. He replied that he was, but that things were OK and that we were friends. We are so not “friends,” lol.

I will be the first one to admit that I’m still very much physically attracted to him and I still miss him very much. It’s clear we both still have feelings for each other. That being said, I’ve done enough work on myself to firmly remind myself that he still doesn’t want to be in a relationship. I remember all the tears and all the deactivations, every single one. I’m 99. 9% sure that if I were to initiate some sort of reconciliation or physical contact, he would go for it – but once again it would be on his terms and completely under his control. He would not magically start taking me out on dates. He would not show me physical affection in front of everybody signaling a relationship. In other words, none of my most basic needs for a relationship would start to get met.

I guess I’m posting this story just to share that, yes, at least some FA exes do make contact and behave in ways that all the videos and articles predict after a break up and especially after no contact. BUT, ask yourself if you really want to get back into that lather rinse repeat cycle. If they’re not doing the work after a considerable amount of time (and you haven’t done work on yourself as well), everything will be exactly the same. It still sucks, but I’m getting better.

525,"Every time before you make a judgemental comment towards avoidants, ask yourself this...","""Would I date an AA?"" Most AAs won't, and even if in theory they say they would, in reality they hardly ever do. And the reason for that is that we're all looking for what we don't have. From an evolutionary perspective, it makes total sense. You're already overfunctioning, emotionally caretake etc, you need someone to complement you, not to do the same, to give your kids the best chance at survival.

The most attractive thing about avoidants to me? Their entitlement to their own space and boundaries. Are they rigid? Hell yeah, it's not exactly healthy boundaries. Did it drive me crazy? Absolutely. But it also made me envious because I didn't use treat myself that way. I used to put other people's emotions first, made sure they were ok before I even got to my space and boundaries. Neither of these sides are healthy, but they do complement each other.

So before you start pointing fingers, ask yourself what attracts you to them in the first place? Because that's where your work lies and you owe that to yourself. The moment you become judgemental towards them is the moment you become judgemental towards yourself. This ""I'm better than you"" attitude I see a lot on here towards avoidants is actually ""I'm not good enough"" in disguise. So every time you make a judgemental comment, just notice that you just put yourself down too... Because when people go on about ""avoidants abusing you by emotionally neglecting you"" you're actually calling yourself a helpless child who's incapable of standing their ground. You're an adult, someone not doing something is not abusing you. You should be interdependent in a relationship yes, but someone not being interdependent with you is not abuse unless you're a child who can't handle their own emotions.

You're not better, you're not worse, you're just different. Notice the differences instead of judging them, and it'll show you the places you can grow so you become your own person and connect to people from that place with respect and integrity. Lead by example instead of demanding people to do what you don't. Because if you're judging avoidants, you're not here to heal.

If you're here, still focusing on someone else, all you do is avoiding yourself. No wonder you're so resentful towards avoidants for doing the same...",uhbdek,55,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/uhbdek/every_time_before_you_make_a_judgemental_comment/,AnxiousAttachment,1

527,He didn't want a relationship and wanted to stay friends.,"It fucking sucks.

He was all in at the beginning. I knew it was too good to be true but got myself excited. We dated for two months.

Then past couple of weeks I noticed he was beginning to pull back slightly, but not to the point where I felt too concerned. I just thought it was a natural progression. He was still texting me and meeting up but something felt... off.

He then met up with me last night and told me that he can't be in a relationship. Nothing to do with me, he just can't give me the time and energy, blah blah. He had been in casual relationships for two years and thought I was different, but realised that he can't give me commitment. 

He wanted to stay friends because he still wants me to be in his life, but I declined. I genuinely don't need more friends and to be honest, I find it difficult process on how he wants to remain friends but not go further with me?

528,How do you self-soothe when triggered?,"I have found that carrying around a small journal and pen has really helped in moments when my anxiety kicks in. For example, last night I was staying with my friend when I became very triggered due to not hearing from my partner and immediately began assuming the worst. I excused myself and immediately started my thought reprogramming. Here is what I did:

1. What's up/what's the thought?

2. Why do I feel like this?

3. What is a healthy solution to this thought?

4. How will I accept the outcome?

In my case here was how I answered:
1. I am afraid that he does not want to hear from me or that he may needs annoyed with me over something I did.

2. I feel like this because the silence makes me afraid that something happened. In reality the silence means I am not connected to him so it makes me worry.

3. A healthy solution is to not assume anything is wrong since he has never told me anything was wrong. I should focus on having a nice time with my friends and if the silence really bothers me then I will send him a quick text telling him to have a great day.

4. If I don't hear from him, I will still not assume. To my knowledge I have not done anything so I will accept that maybe he is busy. If he responds to my message, then all is well.

Low and behold, I chose to do nothing and he ended up texting me a few minutes later apologising for the late response because he was busy with his brother.

531,Will I Ever be in a Healthy Reciprocated Relationship?,"A couple months ago I got ghosted my someone I met off Hinge who made me realize I have anxious attachment.

When I like someone, I get really obsessive and clingy. I got really upset the person cancelled plans with me without rescheduling and never called me when they said they would. This happened in June and I still look at pictures of him every day, still reminisce about past dates and interactions (we only went on four dates.) 

I don’t get like this over most people I meet. Just the ones I really, really like. It worries me because I feel like when I get unhealthy I lose the guy or scare him away. I feel like I’m doomed to settle in a relationship because I obsess over guys I’m genuinely interested in. The last time I really liked a guy I liked him for two years. 

There are certain triggers for me that make me obsess, and the most obvious one is when I’m super attracted to the guy.

\-Reading a self-help book  
\-Renting an up-lifiting movie  
\-Writing down what I'm feeling  
\-Watching 30 Rock (dunno why, but it helps haha)  
\-Putting my phone in a different room and taking a bath  
\-Gardening  
\-Saying words of affirmation to myself  
\-Watching/reading anything about successful and happy single women over 35 lol

533,Dating an AA and tables have turned. Now i know what it’s like dating myself and I’m exhausted.,"I’m starting to gain some sympathy for the guys i’ve dated in the past who couldn’t put up with my anxious attachment. 

My boyfriend is constantly in need of reassurance and doing protest behavior left and right when he’s feeling distant from me. I can clock it right away bc i do and say the same exact things as him when i’m feeling that way. It’s like looking into a mirror. 

You would think this would make things easier since i can see from his perspective but it’s so hard. I feel drained. 

I’m not looking for advice, just wanted to vent. 

Tbh this helps me realize how my attachment style negatively affects others and how protest behaviors are a rly shitty way to try to get love and affection and reassurance. 

i feel like the best way is to just say how you’re feeling, and ask for what you need to make u feel better. 

him and i have been working on that and we tell each other when we feel anxious or paranoid or jealous and we ask exactly why we need reassurance about. 

but it’s a work in progress bc we both slip up and do protest  behaviors in the heat of the moment.

First date was on a Tuesday. We hung out the next 4 out of 5 days following. We were super into each other. I look back and think how we rushed into things so quickly. 

Fast forward we get into a big argument end of September. Not proud to say alcohol was involved so I blew things out of proportion due to an underlying issue that started to stem about 1-2 weeks before the argument - his communication started to suck- which started affecting me.

I ended things tonight. It was so hard. Despite my needs not being met by him, I still liked him so much. I’m disappointed at how quickly I became attached. But I’m also proud for ending things because I know I deserve more.

535,Officially been dumped.,"After hints at marriage just a few weeks ago and months of what seemed like secure consistency, I am dumped like an old banana peel. Ghosted for days, finally had a phone call where he listed off about 30 mistakes I’ve made that are apparently unforgivable. This list included leaving his towel at a friends house, dropping a glass, getting sick after drinking too much one night, chewing too loudly (not a single person has ever mentioned that to me) and some things that I don’t even remember doing. Dramatized things and made it seem like I’m an embarrassing mess. 

Some stuff even seemed made up, like saying I’m to blame for a fight he had with his friend that I literally had nothing to do with. Acted like I’m constantly embarrassing and he has to “parent” me. 

I know you guys don’t know me so you can be thinking “well maybe it’s all true” but I have asked all my friends and family and they said they’ve never noticed these types of mistakes. 

I’m just in shock and sick to my stomach that a partner can act like things are normal while secretly keeping this majorly long list of mistakes the entire time and having no room for patience or improvement. 

To top it all off at the end of the call when I said “welp I’ve got some crying to do” he said “oh you shouldn’t do that, this breakup should be a good thing for you” THEN WHY THE HELL WERE YOU WITH ME ALL THIS TIME?! 

Oh and to top it all off even more there were parts where he was laughing. I had to actually request that he not laugh while he’s actively breaking up with me.

539,The connection between anxiety and knowing you deserve better.,"Anxiety fucking sucks. I think we all know that. However, anxiety is a primal instinct and is used to protect us from perceived danger. For some of us, our brains are just a little more over active than others. Our brains are programmed to move us away from pain. 

I think the fact that my anxiety was on extreme high alert the second time my ex came back into my life was my body’s response to him being a threat to my mental well being. Not me over reacting. Not me being desperate. Not me being “needy”. I’m not generally a needy person and would more identify myself with being a fearful avoidant more than anxious preoccupied. He triggered my anxiety more than ANYONE I’ve ever been with and I’m still trying to figure out why.

I think we let the narratives in our heads get in the way of what our anxiety is actually trying to tell us: that we deserve so much more. So much more understanding. More freedom to be able to express ourselves in a healthy way without fearing being walked out on/stonewalled/or criticized. 

We are all unique and experience and feel love differently so we can’t always expect someone to feel the same about us as we do about them. They can tell us they love us but if their actions are contradicting their words, it’s time to go. Free yourself. You’re worth so much more than bare minimum. You can still love that person and miss them from a distance. I don’t hate my ex. I hate what he did. I will always wish the best for him and care about him but from a safe distance.

So whoever needs to hear this today: you are not broken, there is nothing wrong with your love. You deserve to be happy and sometimes you need to listen to your anxiety because it might just be telling you that you deserve better. We just don’t always want to believe it.",ufarz9,51,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ufarz9/the_connection_between_anxiety_and_knowing_you/,AnxiousAttachment,1

541,A sudden peace has come over me,"My avoidant ex came back after two years. We were texting every few days, I wanted to see if he has worked on his issues and gave him time and space. He initiated contact every time, we had pleasant chats that went on for hours. For nearly three months. He suggested meeting for coffee. He pulled out both times, same with a phone call. Didn't even mention meeting up again. Continued to chat as if nothing had happened.

I called him out on it. Told him that I prefer to talk on the phone and meet up with people. He texted that he likes the same. Then he suggested that we could perhaps do this sometime. Avoidant as ever! Only wants me for an online fantasy relationship on his terms so he won't have to let me come too close.

It's been two weeks since we had this exchange, he  hasn't replied since I asked what ""perhaps sometime "" means.

Today I feel really peaceful. I have stopped struggling and fighting against his resistance. I have completely accepted that I can love him from a distance even if we never have any contact again. I can clearly see that we are not a match. Every interaction with him gives me anxiety about what he'll do next and how long he will be gone when he deactivates without warning. 

I am aware of my worth, my needs my boundaries. I am ready for someone who matches my efforts and is stable and reliable. I will pull out of interactions that are not good for my mental health.

I am secure again!

To everyone who is struggling in the same way: Concentrate on your needs and boundaries, write them down, speak them out loud.

543,Line between anxious attachment and narcissism.,"I've had a lot of realizations lately and I would love to hear other thoughts.

Part of my anxious attachment is being extremely sensitive, jealous, taking things personally, and generally thinking the world revolves around me. My protest behaviors can be unconsciously manipulative. 

After noticing this same pattern in my mother, and doing some research, I realized how these behaviors are also narcissistic.

It leads me to believe that some people with AA might also have narcissistic tendencies. It makes sense, because narcissism is basically such a deep lack of security that one desperately tries to control people around them. 

Just thought this might be a helpful lens through which to view things. Right now this is coming from the context of me being in a relationship with a secure person. It's really shining the light directly onto my insecurities and patterns when there is not an avoidant to blame.

In no way do I mean to belittle the needs of anxious people with avoidant partners. Anxious people deserve to have healthy relationships and our needs met. But there may be some link between these two. 

Now when I am triggered by my partner when rationally it is illogical, I'm going to try to apply this lens and remember that I'm not the center of the universe.",seuudy,54,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/seuudy/line_between_anxious_attachment_and_narcissism/,AnxiousAttachment,1
544,what’s your BIGGEST trigger as an AP?,"mine is without a doubt feeling emotionally shut out by someone who was previously all over me.

and when i say “shut out”, i don’t mean im upset this person can’t talk to me or show affection all the time, people have their own lives and i can’t expect that. 

what i mean is if they’re suddenly “too busy/exhausted” to barely talk to me at ALL despite having the time and effort to do stuff with other people and this never having been an issue for them before and it not changing no matter how much space i give them. 

and if this person who always emphasized the importance of communication is suddenly stonewalling me and being dry and beating around the bush anytime i try to discuss serious things with them.

546,Struggling with Breakup,"I (male lean AP) recently broke up with my female DA partner after 2.5 years together. I would like to say I was AP in my prior long-term relationship and it really woke me up about how much I was pursuing and ignoring myself and my own needs. I did a lot of work on myself before getting back in a relationship. I started this relationship secure, perhaps leaning AP. 

I feel like I did all the things I learned after my prior relationship. Communicating my needs, setting healthy boundaries, being patient, and communicating my needs again. I appreciated the quiet nature of my partner and was told by her that she would open up once she could trust me. The trust part happened, the opening up never came. In fact it just got worse the more the relationship progressed and we talked about moving in together, babies, etc. (This was something that she really wanted). 

My now-ex DA partner was on the extreme side. She found it difficult to acknowledge my presence, would physically pull away from innocent signs of affection like hugs, would stonewall for days, would rarely ever initiate communication. In 2.5 years, we talked on the phone like 5 times, despite living separately the entire relationship. She never said ""I love you"" first the entire relationship, if I look back on it. Kissing was hard to come by. Communicating with her was extremely challenging. Simple questions or discussions would be met with ""i don't knows"" or deflection and irritation. But I know for a fact that she loved me very deeply. 

The biggest thing for me, oddly enough, was that sex vanished. Sex for both of us was AMAZING in the first 3-6 months. Then went down to once a week, then every 2 weeks, then once a month, then once every two months, then we stopped having sex. She wouldn't initiate, would reject every bid, and the times we did have sex she wouldn't do anything for my pleasure. Sex is an important component for me, it's a very intimate thing and I derive a lot of connection from the closeness and touch - I communicated this to her this a few times. Although difficult, I voiced my concern and communicated my needs for intimacy (not just sex) midway through the relationship, and it would result some defensiveness and an ""I'll do better.""  It never did. Towards the end of the relationship she tried to explain that she just couldn't have sex but wouldn't (didn't know why?) shed light on why.

My ex essentially deactivated in all areas of a relationship the more it progressed and I believe it helped drive me into deep depression. The pandemic didn't help things, so I was careful in not pulling the plug before things in our lives stabilized. After months of my individual therapy, her individual therapy, AND 4 months of couples counseling, I just threw in the towel. I think couples counseling actually made things worse because it forced her to hear my feelings and sit in that feeling and process them in a structured way. I think she deactivated the hardest in the days after therapy.

All of this is to say that my ex is a sweet person, a kind and gentle soul. Smart, funny, and patient. But at some point, they have to do the work. I gathered my self-worth and ended the relationship. I miss the person very much, but in no way do I miss the relationship. 

I just wanted to share part of my journey (although I could probably write a book about it) and remind people that at some point (you get to choose!) you have to choose yourself over the other person. You gain nothing by losing yourself. I did it in my prior relationship but I learned that it only leads to getting your heart broken in the relationship and you breaking your own heart. 

The only regret I have is not setting more firm boundaries. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and ended up in a worse place. Could the relationship have survived and even thrived? Perhaps. Slim chance though. I ended up choosing myself over the slim chance the relationship would ever develop into a secure, loving, and intimate relationship. I think I chose wisely.

548,How to let go of PAST relationship anxiety?,"Hey everyone :) before I start, I must say I’m seeking advice in the comments only.

I’m securely attached when single, and somewhat anxiously attached when emotionally intimate with a partner lol. Getting better as I heal, which I’m proud of .. but I have a question. 

Any advice on how to heal from past hurt and anxieties caused from an old relationship? I’m realizing that a lot of my fears and anxieties around trust roots from my first romantic relationship (where trust was broken in every way possible). It feels “stuck” in me I guess because it was my first relationship and not a good foundation for what love is. This reflects into my new relationships, even if they have shown me every wonderful reason that I can trust them. 

It’s like my mind knows they’re separate people and experiences, but my body’s nervous system doesn’t understand that. I’m able to constantly remind myself the truth from past experiences and it helps this anxiety.. but I want to be able to fully reach this state of new trust in my intimate relationships. 

I am in therapy, but are there any approaches or skills that have worked for you to move past this? Maybe I can mention it to my therapist to work on? I’m also spiritual so I am doing a lot of shadow work to process this. But if you have any tips please let me know.",16apcnp,50,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/16apcnp/how_to_let_go_of_past_relationship_anxiety/,AnxiousAttachment,1
549,a friendly reminder to not take rejection/people's actions personally,"You never know the full story. If someone is acting inconsistent, God knows what kind of whirl wind is going on in their mind. It likely has nothing to do with you. Everyone is coping with their own inner demons and sometimes that leaks out in their own behavior. 

If someone rejects you, that's also not your fault. And it's not their fault either. Sometimes I have a bad habit of personalizing rejection. Thinking ""if only I were prettier"", ""if only I were more interesting"", ""if only xyz"". 

Again, you don't really know why someone might reject you. They could be sacked with work. They could be depressed. They could be trying to improve their life and they want to make sure they can show up as their best self for their next partner. They could've been burnt by the last relationship and need time to heal. They could be trying to overcome a bad childhood. It could be anything.

Sometimes they genuinely just don't like you. And that's okay too. My fav saying is ""you can be the ripest peach and there's still someone who doesn't like peaches"". That's not your fault, and that's not their fault. You're just not right for each other.

I hope this helps anyone who's struggling with a rejection wound..I know it hurts, but I promise you you are good enough and you are worthy of both giving and receiving love from someone who is a good fit *for you specifically* ❤️🥰.",10sc9k0,51,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10sc9k0/a_friendly_reminder_to_not_take_rejectionpeoples/,AnxiousAttachment,1

554,Self-neglect when single,"I was talking about my breakup with my friend who is securely attached but is more avoidant in the spectrum. She told me I should be happiest when I'm with myself so that no partner can never make me happier than I am by myself. Thus it will be easier to break up from relationships that are not working because I will always be happier alone. She also reminded I live my whole life with myself so it's better to learn to enjoy my own company.

This made me realize that one reason my single life is miserable is because I don't take care of own my need and wants. For example, my apartment is often messy and I don't cook delicious food when I'm alone. However when a partner or my friends come by I clean up and cook something good. I also never spend money for expensive things when it's only for me (food, furniture etc.), but if my partner wants for example to eat in a nice restaurant I'm eager to go.

I wonder why I'm willing to have nice things only when I'm with company but never just for me. I really have no hedonist tendencies but I'm working on it. I've finally started decorating my apartment, bought an actual bed instead of sleeping on a mattress. I'm eating regularly and cooking food I actually like.

560,They say deep down the truth is AA's are actually emotionally unavailable to their partners. Do you agree with this?,"I keep hearing the same thing in multiple videos from people who have worked with insecurely attached people that the truth about AP's is that they are emotionally unavailable to their partners which is one reason they are drawn to DA's because they subconciously understand that they don't have to be emotionally vulnerable or honest with this type of partner, theres no pressure to open up and the AP can hide their true self by focusing on the DA and their problems and their emotional unavailability in the relationship instead of AP's own emotional unavailability. 

It's not a case of opposite attracts it's a case of like sees like. The main reason why DA's and AP's are attracted to each other is because they are both showing each other outwardly traits that they each repress subconciously. 

DA's present themselves as loners who don't desire romantic love that much while repressing their desire for emotional connection and the AA's present themselves as warm, emotionally open and giving people while repressing their need for space because thats what their upbringing required. Thats why for example AP's don't like being with other AP's usually unless they are becoming more secure leaning because then they can't get the space that they desire deep down when with another AP. 

For AP's it's in some ways a relief to be with DA's because DA's don't ask for much out of them compared to a lot of other people in their life and they don't have to focus on this blindspot within themselves and instead all the focus is on the DA. It's all about the DA's behavior and what they're doing wrong towards the AP instead of what the AP is doing wrong against themselves.

So does this resonate with you on any level? Do you think thats what's really going on with this dynamic deep down?",q742qu,51,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/q742qu/they_say_deep_down_the_truth_is_aas_are_actually/,AnxiousAttachment,1
561,Why do we care that they miss us?,"I saw a comment on the avoidant sub asking why APs care if our ex Avoidants miss us... I wrote this as a few reasons... would love to see if others agree or have more to add.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Preoccupied:** APs are SO preoccupied. We can't eat, think, do anything when heartbroken. The idea that we are so obsessed and sad and the other person is out living their best life.... leads to my next point of
2. **Feeling unheard and not trusting our emotions and being embarrassed by our emotions -** I felt unheard and my feelings were not seen. Seeing someone else miss us makes us feel not ""crazy"" for having emotions
3. **Validation.** A lot of APs see themselves through their partners eyes. Deep down, I know I am a truly an amazing person, but I had such low self esteem, I only thought I was amazing because my partner validated it. When they leave.... that crushes me. I lose myself. If they miss me.... it's a sign they still think I'm special.
4. **missing = caring about us.**  APs deeply care for others. They want the same back.
5. **Hot and cold attachment figures** Personally I'm AP because my dad was hot and cold with me. So breakups are tough... someone is hot then cold to you. Reminds you of your attachment figure who is supposed to unconditionally love you...
6. **Triggers of other pain** The above 5 points bring up a lot of pain and childhood wounds. It's sometimes tough because you feel like you finally found that partner who ""gets it"" but it can bring up a lot buried feelings.

562,Newly secure win.,"Hey friends. So, I've been working diligently on being more secure in my attachment. I made some major strides in the last year, which includes being single for a year and saying no to an abusive ex who tried to come back. 

I rekindled a texting relationship with this guy who I met through a dating app. I slowly started to remember why I stopped talking to him the first time. He's super obsessive and anxiously attached. He kept talking about us as a couple and how great our relationship would be. Then on new years, he started getting sexual. I had sent him a few selfies (clothed) and made some jokes, but never tried to sext him. He told me he was masturbating while texting me. I said ""Nope, have a good night "" 

I told him the next day that sex shouldn't be on the table, because he needs to take me out on a date and we need to see if there's chemistry. He was like ""How can you be upset about me talking about sex when you send me a sexy picture? You're sending mixed signals"". I was like ...""No, I'm not . Any either way, I'm telling you how it needs to be for me to move forward.""

He sent novels of texts about how I should know he's interested in dating me seriously. How he'll get in his car and drive to me so we can have a talk about it. I was like, no.....you need to do this properly and date me. And apologize for being pushy. He did, but it was laced with him mostly blaming me for leading him on.I said I need some time to think. 

I messaged him today, after realizing how draining he is, and said I am gonna focus on myself. That I didn't wanna disappear because I know how that sucks. He said ""it's probably best that you don't date. You seem to have a lot of trauma that makes you push away good guys.""  Good guys don't call themselves good guys, in my experience. 

I realized that almost every word out of his mouth was a pity party. How women never gave him chances because he doesn't have a lot to offer. And it was just all so unattractive to me. How he would text me constantly and wanting SO much before even meeting. It showed me he just wanted to claim me as his gf because he just wants ANYONE. There was no discernment. He was idealizing me and it made me so uncomfortable. 

I'm proud of myself for not buying into his manipulations and draining insecurities. I can look back at my past behaviors, which were similar to his, and realize how unhealthy I was. I'm not sure if trying to date someone with anxious attachment made me secure....because the lady guy I dated was dismissive and I felt anxious around him.  All I know if I want a secure relationship from now on. I hope that I can find someone loving, but secure, so we can be healthy together.

563,"Anxious with avoidant partners, avoidant with secure partners?","Not sure if anyone can relate but I’ve noticed when I’m with avoidant partners I lean extremely anxious. I think so highly of them, think we have an amazing chemistry, almost become addicted to them and the little validation they give me. 

However, I’ve most recently become involved with a more secure person and I’m finding myself a little... bored? He’s consistent, willing to talk through any issues, no drama, able to reassure me when I ask, etc. But not over the top with compliments or love bombing (which I know is healthy). But I find myself still day dreaming about the “chemistry” I had with past toxic avoidant partners. 

Is there a way to let myself enjoy this relationship an not over think how I feel about this person? I just don’t find myself admiring them as much as I’ve admired past avoidant partners, and I find myself looking for faults. Overall I find this secure person very attractive and look forward to spending time with them, just not in the all-consuming way I’m used to with avoidant partners.

565,Ways in which I cope with my attachment,"I call it healing because there is significant pain I go through when my feelings latch onto people and either get ripped away, or I react in such a way that damages me.

&#x200B;

1. I reflect on the amazing things about me that this person wasn't able to appreciate. The parts of me that I am proud of. The parts of me that if my partner had - I'd bend over backwards for. I notice that once my attachment circuit goes into throttle I forget and diminish myself, and idolize them. Reflecting on the parts of me I love reminds me that if they can't appreciate these parts of me, I'll find someone who will
2. No response to a text. Calls going to VM. Not making plans for the next date. Short, 2 word responses. All send me inter anxiety-overdrive.  What do I do? I let the discomfort take hold and watch it. I focus on the feelings and what does that mean right now? What words am I saying to myself that are making my heart race. My shoulders tense. Shallowed breathing - or hold it all together!  I ask myself if those things I'm saying to myself have any proof. Who's validated those statements. What story have I made up in my head, and why am I believing it. Usually - there is no proof. 
3. I'm assertive and tell them what I want and need. ""I'm going with the flow"" - usually means avoidant. So I ask them if that means they're looking for something committed at some point.  I've grieved my heart enough times thinking people will read my mind. Guess what, they can't. And if you don't ask those questions - you'll grieve as well when you find out answers to your questions from them the hard way.
4. I journal. Partially why I'm writing this post now. I need to get my thoughts out of my head and onto paper (or the internet :P).  This allows me the space to see the thoughts in my head and whether they are valid.

We had not spoken for about eight or so weeks and he reached out to me during the christmas holiday saying he missed me and wanted to understand why we broke up and why I was so unhappy. I was initially really combative over text because I spent most of our relationship trying to make things work and explaining to him in great detail why and how his actions hurt me. I tested as secure before the relationship and I ended up anxious and on medication because of how brutal his avoidant behaviours were. It was awful.

Eventually I calmed down and he apologised and gave me his side of the story and told me he is now in therapy and wants us to make things work. He's being super supportive and patient with me and is showing me closeness I never experienced with him before. And he insists he wants to get back together. I still miss him to an extent and I do love and care for him but I just don't trust him or his intentions. I feel like I'm being set up.

I don’t mind not constantly being in connection and would rather talk face to face but how do I help get out of my old obsessive ways  and thoughts?

571,Those first 2-3 months 👀,"I noticed with every avoidant person I've dated, they were very affectionate and communicative for the first 2-3 months before deactivating.

Usually, their threshold for not talking to me is 2 weeks to 2 months. After this time is up, they usually come looking for me. Occasionally, they'll wait an entire YEAR. 

I'm not making this post to teach you how to thrive in relationships like this (UNLESS they admit their attachment style is hurting you both and they want to seek therapy for it or are at least consistently working on themselves, and ofc you'd want to be working on your own attachment style regardless if you're dating or not). 

I'm making this post to show you that their pattern is NOT your fault and to please take things slow and observe their behavior in those few 2 months. I noticed that unhealed avoidants tend to throw up these 3 red flags in the start (at least in my experience) 

They rush the relationship and beg for exclusivity. They tell me they love me WAY too soon and beg for me to say it back , then they'll accuse me of not liking them when I don't. And they future fake really bad. Promising me the world, and never delivering. 

Now, this isn't an anti-avoidant post (nor am I saying only avoidants act like this. But they're the only ones I've ever dated). I 100% understand that most avoidants don't do this on purpose and they are just as confused as you are a lot of the time, however this doesn't make their behavior any less painful or acceptable.

If you see them (or just any attachment style in general) throwing up red flags like a clown juggles balls at a circus. RUN, run while you aren't completely attached and before your self esteem gets dropped into an abyss. It's so much harder to leave someone when you're a year and 6 months into the relationship than those first 2-3 months.

I know that when I dated toxic people I knew exactly what was about to happen when they love bombed me. I knew that I was about to be led down rabbit hole that there was no coming out of it. I knew their behavior wasn't normal or healthy. But because I'm not healthy myself, I accepted their bad behavior. Because I was lonely, bored, and lacking in esteem (as you can see I am also a clown that chucks up red flags) 🤡

Long story short, don't be me lmao


Edit: and I just want to add that I'm not saying anxious-avoidant relationships can't work. They absolutely can! But both sides need to be aware and actively working on their triggers and insecurities. I have no problem admitting just how radioactively toxic I was a few years ago. I used to cyberstalk, be verbally abusive, and very VERY spiteful. My ex was abusive but that doesn't mean I can be abusive back. I should have left instead, but I didn't and it wrecked my self esteem further. Not from just how my ex treated me, but the shame I felt for allowing it and allowing myself exhibits the same toxic behavior I criticized others for (nothing good ever comes from being a hypocrite)",x5tdrg,50,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/x5tdrg/those_first_23_months/,AnxiousAttachment,1
572,"I'm struggling to get over how my avoidant ex treated me during his deactivation. (I just need support right now, not a debate about avoidants).","He's an ex for a reason. Since we broke up, I have been super vigilant in healing myself and my attachment  style. I've been journalling, spending time on my hobbies, seeing friends, watching self-help videos and generally trying to live a life for me. I've started working out to deal with my anxiety and it's done wonders for me. I'm also in therapy though I've paused it due to finances. Despite the progress I've made and how good in general that I feel about my life since breaking up, I still have his voice in my head. And the wildest thing is, I'm over him as a person. I don't have those romantic feelings anymore. But I'm not over how he treated me. (**and before people accuse me of assuming his attachment style, we took the test together twice and he came out as hardcore DA in both**).

He was really critical and harsh towards me when he deactivated. To the point where some of my friends thought he was emotionally abusing me. He would pick at me over the smallest things, he would constantly put me on the spot if I didn't know about a topic he knew, he would sometimes even just look at me with a lot of contempt. He would also do things that he knew bothered me and wouldn't respect the boundaries of our relationship when it came to other women. For example he continued to be friends and even get closer to a girl I was very worried about. Another time I caught him texting a former FWB. 

Sometimes, even in a good moment, his actions and words pop up in my head. I still find myself getting triggered and questioning myself and my intellectual abilities. Overall I am making progress in my healing but the one thing that won't go away is his voice in my head. I often find myself still spiralling thinking of the ways he treated me.

574,"It's okay to feel angry, and it's okay to give up","This is kind of a part two of the last post I just made of the 5 stages of grief, and lowkey calling myself out. Right now I keep oscillating between anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Mostly anger and acceptance.

There's been a recent influx of ""anti avoidant posts"" and comments tone policing them. Me being one of those tone police. It's not my place to tell people they can't feel angry about what they experienced. Especially since I know what it's like. Honestly I think it was some projection on my end.

I'm very angry with how I was treated. I don't hate my partner (or ex tbh I don't even know what they are anymore lmfao), but I'm very upset with what I was just put through. Sometimes we just have to experience that raw pure anger before making any radical change (this is how activists start movements. They witness or experienced injustices that made them angry and caused them to take action)

It becomes toxic when we stay stuck in that mental state, when injustice being a catalyst for change instead turns into a victim mentality that leaves no room for growth. That's when things become an issue, which to be completely honest I don't see too often here. It's also normal to go back and forth through the stages of grief, some days you'll accept the situation. Some days you'll feel down about the situation. Some days you'll day dream and miss that person. Other days you might feel vengeful and angry at that person. It's okay, and it's normal. 

On to the second part of this post. I'm giving myself permission to give up. There's nothing i can do to get my partner to change. For the last few days my mantra has been ""there's nothing for me here"". Me wasting my energy trying to nurture and ""love"" my partner out of his own trauma so I can get a few breadcrumbs of validation is not much different than me trying to eat scraps off of a buffet table after everyone else ate first and left. *there's nothing for me here*.

In a weird twist, he reached out after a week and instead of being emotionless, he was extremely pissed. He blamed me for leaving him without ""talking things out."" He said it was fucked up and said how much it pissed him off. No empathy, nothing. He changed his original story and said that I misunderstood him, and that he meant that marriage wasn't a priority to him right now and could be in the future.

I felt like I was going crazy during our conversation. I wondered if I really had screwed up and misunderstood him. Then, I thought about all the times he needed space and I gave it to him. I thought about the times I tried to talk with him about a problem and he dismissed it or blew it off.

Finally, he said he wasn't happy with me and didn't want to be with me after ""the way I acted that past week."" I just said ok and didn't fight him on it.  I'm sad, but the way he spoke to me was unacceptable. In the end, he didn't want to own up to what he had said or how he was acting, he didn't want to deal with his avoidant issues, so he found a way to make it my fault and bail. Knowing that there was no way to salvage the relationship AND his attitude towards me really nips any temptation to talk to him in the bud.

Maybe his new lady friend keeps things surface level and doesn’t require the level of intimacy and vulnerability that I do, however, it still feels like a slap in the face. Of course I feel unworthy and not good enough - I feel like even a secure person would.

Objectively, I know at the end of the day it wasn’t a good match. He has a history of sexual abuse and familial trauma that he has repressed and I don’t want a partner who hasn’t done any self work.

Sadly, I keep thinking that I wasn’t enough and I’m also angry that he is happy and loved up because I’m in so much pain and feel disposable. It’s childish, but it’s what I’m feeling.

579,A Positive experience- Finding My Happiness in me,"Hi All,

So, I have written regarding my breakup earlier in this sub as well, but today i want to share my experience hoping that this will help someone.

So, i was in a relationship for 4 years, and i always kept it on priority, i used be so afraid of it breaking that i used to stop myself from doing everything, saying yes to him and his things when i wanted to shout no and this slowly triggered my anxiety and anxious attachment, over the years i was in a bubble that this relationship is the best thing i had. I was told that i am wrong for having small expectations like compliments or empathy from my partner and silly me accepted that part as well.

You know they say that girls break up mentally before they walk away physically, that's true in my case, slowly and slowly i watched him go, i saw myself crying every night, i couldnt sleep properly.

They day he called it off, i wasn't shocked, it was like i was prepared and i let him go. It was the nail in the coffin, because i was at my worst health and that time my mind said dude fuck it, you dont deserve this.

YES ! IT DID HURT, YES I CRIED! but it was not like i was devastated. I gave myself 2 days to absorb and feel everything i was going through, surprisingly i had no anxiety attack even in this situation.

After 1.5 weeks, i went on a girls trip and i enjoyed the heck out of it, when i came back i realized that all i was thinking about of was me and my trip.. Today I am sleeping so much better, eating healthy and i am happy to announce that in past 20 days i haven't had any time of anxiety.

You Know, you keep ourselves in a bubble the fairyland love and we give everything to a person, and even when its not reciprocated back, we just accept it.

But life is good, you are good .. yes I still believe in love and one day(Not now, I am still finding myself) I will find someone who will know who to love me well and so will you all.

Please remember every romantic relationship is replaceable, we should never compromise of our boundaries and happiness for any other person.

584,"How to deal with someone telling you ""I love you"" and ""I can't be in a committed relationship but want to remain friends""?","We had a thing (don't know what to call it) for about 6 months. He (24M) was the first to say ""I love you"" and I ended up falling for him too, quite hard. We haven't really had any arguments, found a great support person in each other and the sexual chemistry was always perfect (for both of us).

When I met him I'd just ended a 5 years relationship that has left scars I am now starting to realise thanks to therapy. He was there for me while I was struggling and told me I could tell him anything and that he wanted to take care of me etc etc. So even though I was reluctant, I let it happen, also because I was exhausted emotionally and would've done anything for support. Next month I'll leave the country we are both in to study abroad for a semester (we're not too far, it's about a 2.5h flight) so I asked him what we're going to be from here.

He said he loves me, but he can't be in a serious relationship with anyone, and ""If I could be with someone, it would be you"". That he doesn't want to lie to me and stay together when he knows he doesn't do well in relationships. Another reason is that he doesn't want us to make choices because of the partner, because if something goes wrong we'd start resenting each other. I asked him if it would've been different had I stayed. He answered he doesn't know. 

He also said he would like to remain friends and that he's afraid staying together will just bring to a bad breakup, while instead he ""Can see our friendship lasting until we're old"". He's already been talking about hanging out (and probably having sex if I want it) in September since I'm going back home for a few days.

All of this of course hurt me terribly and confused me at the same time. I keep hanging on to the idea that he wants to see me again and can't hold back the thought I haven't been enough, that if I'd done or been even a little different he would've wanted me. I continuously picture how it could've been and maybe even secretly still hope. 

Everything considered, the issue is I don't know how to read his words. He's always been honest with me and in this case especially I don't think he has any reason to lie. Am I missing something here? How can I look at what's happening in a more objective way? It's hard to figure out what's going through his mind and therefore to know how to cope will all this.

It's especially hard because my closest friends are all making choices taking their partner into account too. For example, as much as I love my best friend, I have to listen to frequent complaints about her by her boyfriend (whom I'm also old friends with) about how she's never free and always tired and in crisis because of life choices I won't tell here. But in spite of it all, he stays with her and has made all his academic choices so that he could stay in town for her. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for them and hope they keep it good as they always have, but I can't help but comparing myself to them and finding confirmation that my friend was worthy enough of those kinds of adjustments, but I was not. I can see I use their situation as fuel for negative self-talk.  


ps. I should maybe mention this guy has a severe anxiety disorder. Some days he can't leave the house because of  it. So I also keep picturing that he might not want to be with me because he wants to solve these issues on his own and then maybe we'll have a chance. He's never said this, so I know I'm just making it up in my head. I just don't know how to stop doing it.",1597kb5,49,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/1597kb5/how_to_deal_with_someone_telling_you_i_love_you/,AnxiousAttachment,1

I don't know about you, but for me. Blocking has ALWAYS backfired. Every single time time I've blocked them I got cold feet and then unblocked them. Now they have to friend me back (which they won't) and now I feel extra rejected that I can't get back to them 

Whenever I embrace the anxiety, allow myself to be triggered, I always make it through. When I block, I create anticipation (did they text me yet!? I hope the miss mee!!). That anticipation makes me think of that person 10x more. So then I unblock them, refriend them, or reinstall what ever social app I uninstalled to see if they replied 

Surprise surprise THEY DIDN'T. Then I feel stupid, rejected, and 10x more desperate had I just accepted being triggered.

This also goes for avoiding things that remind me of them. I've stopped listening to certain songs, uninstalled my fav social apps, even VIDEO GAMES. Just to avoid being triggered

And you know what that did? Absolutely *nothing* of course lmao. It did nothing but block myself from things I actually enjoyed too on top of feeling rejected and anxious because of the anticipation I created. 

At this point, I allow myself to be triggered and anxious. In the end, things *always* turn out okay. It takes a while, but it always turns out okay.  I go back to being regulated and I even get a confidence boost knowing I have the restraint to not continue giving energy to people that don't want me. 

Knowing that I was left on read or didn't get a reply back is also a sobering reminder of where I stand in this person's life. No anticipation, because I know what's happening.

590,I’m in a relationship with an avoidant and I love it,"I’m a male (23), my partner is a female (31). We met online and are in a LDR. Everything was (And still is) perfect in the beginning, the communication, the affection, we would talk constantly and share so much about each other. We both talked about each other’s past, our struggles, beliefs, interest, etc and this helped us form a friendship that then shortly after blossomed into a beautiful relationship. We match each other’s energy, we act like weirdos, we say random things, we aren’t afraid to share our thoughts or secrets, we have so much trust in each other it’s crazy and we never felt a connection like this with anyone. 

She warned me she would be a horrible girlfriend because of the way she is, but I didn’t listen, I just wanted to be with her

As time went on and the honeymoon phase faded, both our attachment styles showed. I started to notice her becoming distant, less texting, less affection, less of her asking to cam or do anything and that was triggering. There would be times where we unintentionally triggered each other. There would be some ugly fights. She would pull away, lash out at me, become cold and say nasty things, meanwhile I had breakdowns, felt insecure, anxious, and was emotionally unstable freaking out and assuming the relationship was ruined. Unfortunately, logic and reasoning doesn’t work when you’re going through a traumatic and triggering episode. Both her and I are in therapy and communicate to help better understand each other and to give a safe space so we can express our feeling and thoughts. We believe this is a healing relationship for both of us to grow. What she lacks in, I give to her. What I lack in, she gives to me. We both know we never want to hurt each other, we both apologize when the other is hurt, we both communicate. I rather spend the worst days with her than the best ones with someone else. 

Because at the end of the day we both fear losing each other. She’s told me the reason it’s hard to express, why she’s distant, and it’s hard to open up is because subconsciously the closer I am to her, the more she loves me, and that if something happens to us one day she will lose me forever and will be alone and go through trauma because she loved too much and intensely. It’s harder for her because she was (emotionally) neglected when she  needed support, guidance, safety, understanding, etc and believed that her emotions dont really matter to the people who are responsible for her, so she got used to dealing with them by herself, but as a child she was not not equipped yet to understand, sort, and process these emotions, so that aspect is not taught and it carries over to relationships but at the same time she CRAVES this connection, this love, this relationship, me. She’s just scared and that’s what most avoidant’s are. They’re scared because of traumatic experiences, they’re scared to open up, they’re scared to express, they’re scared of the unpredictability because others hurt them and made them this way. 

Yes, there are times I get annoyed and upset, but she never had anyone be so gentle with her, patient, and understanding when it comes to her trauma and triggers and that makes it easier for her to open up and believe me she feels awful that she sometimes can’t give that same type of energy or effort back, but I don’t want her to feel that way or try to reach something that’s difficult for her. It’s hard because she doesn’t know how to, she was never shown this type of love and safety, it’s different to her. When she does start to express and let herself be vulnerable, to let those walls down, it’s uncomfortable, but she does that for me, for us, to heal and grow even when it scares her. 

I know it can feel like we put in more effort than they do, show more than they do, ask to hang or do something, and say more than they do etc. Just remember it’s not something they’re used to, it’s not something they’ve been taught, it’s not because they want to hurt you. It’s just draining for them, and I know it can be draining for the receiving party, but both need to communicate, compromise, and be patient. It’s not you vs them. It’s you and them vs the problem(s).

Edit: It’s like some of you hold so much resentment and can’t believe an anxious and avoidant relationship actually works because yours failed. Sorry for the failed relationships and frustrations, but don’t try to lecture me about my relationship because you don’t know anything. I’m happy, she’s happy, we’re both happy.

So I basically decided to express my discomfort and told him that It wasn’t the first time that that happened and If the situation became unhealthy, I’d have to leave the situation, I expressed that that kind of behaviour made me feel alone in the situation. He responded that “It was hard for him to stay in touch all the time”. I sent him an audio and clarified that I never asked for that, and that talking with someone in the phone is supposed to be something that you do for fun, but If at the time he felt uncomfortable or not in the mood… he could openly tell me, I then sent an audio sayind that If he could not do It then It was fine (I deleted this last audio because I thought that It sounded like I was finishing off the relating) but he already listened to It before I deleted It. I waited the whole night and received no response. So the following morning I decided to delete the first audio and his messages were the one remaining. 

Its been 2 weeks and we haven’t texted each other. (We still follow ig on instagram and see e/o stories) 

This whole situation has triggered my abandonment issues. And even though I am doing just fine, I was this underlying feeling of sadness because I really like him, and an understanding that this situation is not good for me. 

I know these triggers steem from receiving the silent treatment continuously from my mother’s way of parenting and I am in the process of becoming secure. I’ve been through this many times and I am trying to change my approach to these kind of situations. Normally I would: 

-start protesting behaviour and accuse him of doing everything wrong
-delete him from all my social media due to resentment 
-trying to express myself and text him. 

I think these are all trauma driven reactions and I would like to do this differently and practice protecting myself without compromising my sense of security or pretending that I don’t care when in fact, I am having a hard time ignoring the situation. 

What would someone healed or in the process to do?

593,"AP/DA couple working through issues, I would like to share our ""cheat sheet""","I'm linking a pdf to a ""cheat sheet"" template me and my partner created because after years of conflict, misunderstanding, miscommunication and our attachment styles clashing, we needed to just put everything out on the table. Our goal is to refer back to our cheat sheet whenever an issue comes up.

When I told my friends that I (AP) was doing this they told me it's too much! But my DA was on board and I don't think it's ""too much"", I think it's really helpful and important for both parties to think and write out exactly what their needs are, what that looks like to them, how the other would like this need communicated, etc. We've been working on our cheat sheets together on google docs and I think it's the healthiest thing we've ever done. It's been really insightful, for example, despite having been with my DA for 5 years, I didn't know what he needs from me when he is deactivating until he explained it on the cheat sheet!

Disclaimers: I don't know if this'll work for us long term, we're still in the process of filling our sheets out together and discussing things, maybe it'll all go out the window when conflict arrises. I hope not though.

Do not send this to a partner who is unwilling or deactivating, I think that would be ""too much"".

You don't need to be in a relationship to do this, it's a great exercise to write out everything you want/need/expect in future relationships.

Not sure if people will find this useful but I wanted to share because it's been great for us so far.

598,A Reminder: They’re not responsible for your emotions & feelings. You are responsible for how you react.,"-Hard pill to swallow, even for myself, as someone who subconsciously thinks back to the thought they’ll leave. Take a moment, match your thoughts to reality, identify the feeling. Understand there may be other reasons why they’re acting the way they are.

-You are worth the care, master your beliefs, master your thoughts, and let them translate to your actions. You are worth that same amount of love; care you’re so willing to put on the line for that other person. You deserve to be happy. You deserve to be joyful. You deserve love.

-Love yourself wholeheartedly. Beyond measure. In the areas where past caregivers, parents, significant others fell short; fill yourself, forgive yourself. Neither party was wrong in the situation, both parties were simply unaware or unable. And this will hopefully translate to your future relationships.

-Put faith in yourself. You are strong. You are 
mentally capable. You have the ability to master yourself. You are powerful beyond measure.

-Work on your passion projects. Fall in love with yourself. Remain enamored by the idea of cultivating creative, mental, spiritual, emotional, physical growth. And be willing to fail at your passion projects, you will open up channels of growth; improvement you would have never seen prior.

-They will tell you if they want to walk away or need space. They have other tasks to attend to right now for their growth. Understand they want to feel loved as well, they want to add to your happiness, they want to be there for you.

-They won’t always be there for you, and that is OKAY. Even if they do walk away, understand it is for the better of you two, rather than play the blame game. This is part of your story, you are simply between chapters of the novel you call “Your Life”

603,Take a good look at yourself in the mirror. The only way to heal is find something better.,"It took me 5 months to get over my breakup. And I still couldn't get over my ""fear of abandonment"".   


But when I look back at the messages I wrote my ex, I'm disgusted by myself.   


I know it hurts, I know precisely where it hurts. Anyone having panic attacks? I had them. People who are afraid of depression or sadness doesn't know what anxiety or emptiness feels like. I know the blame game, oh I love the blame game. It requires a lot of courage to accept criticism, even a lot more to criticize yourself and improve. No, I'm not talking about the victim minded people, but the ones who demonize their exes to get over them.   


Maybe they were a narcissist or a player or a psychopath or whatever. They were sent by the devil to hurt your soul, it's possible. But you picked them, you chose them, you ignored the red flags, you put them on a pedestal(maybe they are still there?). If you can muster the courage to look within, to ""know thyself"" before we fire blames at the avoidants/FAs/cluster Bs, you would be damn proud of yourself once you have healed.   


It takes a lot to look at the mess that exists in your subconscious brain. Maybe that is how people become ""secure"". I didn't go to a therapist, but I surely cried a lot in the pillow, talked a lot, wrote a lot of emails that I never sent etc. When I read those emails now, I feel like wtf did I write. And how on Earth would a sane person want to come back to me after reading that shit.   


Maybe it was you, maybe it was her, but if you chose her, it was still you. So take on the blame like a man, suck it up, and improve yourself.   


It will get better, it always does. But what you become when you come out the other side is up to you. If you don't heal, you are still that anxious cry baby. Even the next relationship could fall apart, and the one after that too. Healing is like fixing yourself, bit by bit, so that when the next person comes along(they always do don't they? You ain't gonna die single), they should be proud of you.   


Enough emotions, here is some practical advise -   


* Meditation - I'm surprised by the number of people who will just deflect blame, who will do everything in their power to avoid looking within, or at their past. Meditation is like having a third person view from the top, you looking at yourself in a third person view. Once you get a hold of your emotions(the logic is doing fine, its your emotions), \*you\* can be present, when your thoughts are going haywire. 
* Gym/exercise - It makes you feel better. Attention/validation makes you feel better. Yes it's more about your feelings than what you look like. Why do you think people post their nudes on the internet? It's for attention or validation. These two things can give you a quick ""high"" which helps, it really helps. And exercising also makes sure you ""did"" something, you worked on yourself, instead of sitting on the bed crying your eyes out, you went out and did something. Doing something/feeling of achievement gives you dopamine. Dopamine can fix ANYTHING. Why do you think people take drugs? It's for the dopamine of course, they want it without putting in the work. 
* Diet / Supplements - Scientists say that you should take vitamin D during winters when there is no Sun. Are they stupid? Yeah we are the only smart ones around here right, the scientists are just bunch of stupid nerds. Your body requires certain things to make those ""feel good"" hormones. If you gonna sit there on your bed, crying day in day out, not move, not eat properly, then you will become deficient in something for sure. Your diet drops, your hormones drop, your mood drops.
* Move - It really does help guys, it really does. I don't know what walking/running does to you, but it seriously does help. 
* People - If you socialize, you will realize life exists outside your ex and the fantasy world you created. You will realize 80% relationships fail, maybe 40%(not sure with the statistics) marriages fail. You are gonna die anyways, it might even happen tomorrow, nobody knows. But it will require a lot of effort to go out and put on that fake smile, but eventually it will turn into a real smile. 
* Fantasize( I don't suggest this but oh well ) - People actually use this shit. They will fantasize about a future perfect partner which really helps with the anxiety. It's a short term solution though. 

In the end it's up to you. But your ex certainly doesn't want what you are right now. You can't turn off your anxiety, but you can learn to manage it. You can't (in most cases) get your ex back, but you can replace her with something(or a bunch of things).   


Motivation for the highly obsessed ones - Improve yourself, take 6 months and work on yourself. Then go back to her with this better self. Hopefully you will heal by then and won't be affected by the outcome.",10zlv1h,46,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10zlv1h/take_a_good_look_at_yourself_in_the_mirror_the/,AnxiousAttachment,1

I believe this person has avoidant tendencies, seems healthy in superficial interactions but always shut down any hint at criticism even if brought up politely.

I am literally devastated after getting ghosted and can’t stop thinking about this person, hoping to “meet them by accident” somewhere, fantasising about them liking me, obsessing over what I could have done differently… I read our conversation over and over again, even has other people read it, all of them said that I was polite but he clearly didn’t want to hear about it, even though my concerns were valid.

It’s often very frustrating because I can’t see myself making progress and it feels hopeless. But I’ve noticed something lately and I thought I’d share it because it sure feels like progress: 

I’m noticing I’m more able to be compassionate and hold space for other people’s feelings WITHOUT believing my feelings or perspectives are less valid. The most recent example came up in a conflict I had with a friend today. We live in kind of a small town and my friend wanted me to take sides in her friend’s breakup and stop talking to her friend’s ex, who I met recently in an unrelated way, and who I see a potential friendship with. I told her I wasn’t willing to do that because I wasn’t in the relationship and it’s frankly none of my business who was in the “wrong” (as someone with attachment wounds I too well know relationship issues are rarely about someone being “right” and someone else being “wrong”). She was pretty upset and said she was hurt that I wasn’t siding with her or her friend. She also implied that I was going to sleep with or date the ex, which is not my plan at all, so that didn’t feel great. Anyway, in the past I would have felt a strong mixture of guilt (for apparently letting my friend down) and anger (feeling like my boundaries were being violated by someone trying to make decisions about my friendships for me, and also by the unwelcome implication that talking to someone means I’m planning to have sex with them). But today I was able to remain firm in my position and express curiosity and compassion around the emotional reaction she was having without taking it on or identifying with it. Her behaviour wasn’t great, but I didn’t let it wound me and I could see her humanity in it and forgive her as it happened.

I think the whole thing with secure attachment is having your own back enough that you aren’t threatened by other people’s feelings. Setting boundaries is an important part of becoming secure, but the more secure you are, the easier boundaries start to feel.",xdu7wv,47,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/xdu7wv/something_im_noticing_as_i_move_towards_secure/,AnxiousAttachment,1
609,This entire time I’ve been subconsciously looking for a parent and I see everything so clearly now,"I started EMDR therapy to heal my neglect wound and now I’m starting to see everything so clearly. I expected so much out of my romantic partners. I would get triggered into emotional flashbacks and I would have anxiety attacks because I felt like I was being abandoned. Sometimes it would be over them not texting back within a day. 

It wasn’t until after my recent session where I realized that this entire time what I was really looking for in partners was a parent. You know how when a child is a baby/toddler they’re the parent’s entire world and etc. and they’re told that they’re loved and cared for? Where their emotional needs are met? Where they’re checked on 24/7 and supervised? I never got that. So in adulthood I have grown to be very needy and desperate to fill the hole that I’ve had since I was a child. Now I realize that I was subconsciously looking for a parent. Now that I’ve had this realization I feel less anxiety and less mental stress. I’m going to continue healing my inner child and I’m hoping that this will help heal my anxious attachment. 

And I’m mostly sharing this because some of you might not realize what it is you’re really looking for in relationships. I highly recommend counseling and EMDR for childhood trauma.

610,"Thought he was avoidant but it turns out, he’s secure.","I definitely have an anxious attachment style. Even so far as being confirmed by my therapist. I’m not sure if this has happened to anyone else, but I’m absolutely shocked by how my relationship has changed.

At the beginning, I thought we were polar opposites. I always thought he never cared much about our relationship, seeing me, time together, intimacy etc. We fought a lot, and could be downright nasty to each other. I spent the better part of a year believing that our relationship had an inevitable expiration date.

I got into therapy a couple of months ago. My therapist is absolutely amazing and has helped me so much. She introduced me to the book Attached, where I discovered that my boyfriend is actually a secure type, when I thought for sure he was avoidant. The underlying issue turned out to be… ME! Not 100%, I’m not saying he’s blameless. The more I looked at myself and my behavior though, I could not deny the storm I was causing between us.

I started sharing stuff with him. Things I was learning in therapy and about different relationship types. I started becoming more patient, less reactive to irrational emotions like anger, jealousy, and just accepting my insecurities as my own problems, not his problems.

One day he came to me and he said, “I want to do better. I can see everything you’re doing for us, and I want to do the same. You deserve so much love, and you deserve a good man. I love you, and I want to be that man for you. I want to give you everything you could ever want. You mean the world to me and I want you with me always. I never want to lose you, especially over stupid fights.”

Once I relaxed, started caring for myself, he pulled me in closer. He has no fear of intimacy like I once thought. He doesn’t push me away like I convinced myself he does. He shows affection constantly now, and always wants to spend time with me. He holds me, tells me how amazing I am, and has been bugging me to move in with him. He wants to do everything I’ve ever wanted, and all I had to do was accept that this man loves me, and give him the grace of being his own person.

My advice to other anxious types: stop sweating the small stuff. Find ways to cope with your anger, resentment, fear, and jealousy. Once you start to heal, you may realize your avoidant isn’t actually avoidant. You’re just pushing away a great catch.

(I feel the necessity to add this disclaimer: I’m in no way advocating to succumb to avoidants in hopes that they react like my boyfriend did. He’s not an avoidant, so I can’t possibly know how that dynamic feels. I just thought I was with one but it turns out I’m not.)",vdzorw,48,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vdzorw/thought_he_was_avoidant_but_it_turns_out_hes/,AnxiousAttachment,1

613,"I did the right thing today and was honest about wanting something serious, not casual.","Feels awful.

I'd only gone on a few dates with him, which went really well. I wasn't trying to get over-invested, but I also know by now that I don't want to fall into another non-relationship where everything feels intimate but I lose points by trying to ask about the future.

Today I asked via text about talking on the phone between dates, since I temporarily live at a distance, and he replied wanting to let me know that he only wants something casual. I think my reply to him about how I'm ready for something more serious, eventually, is maybe the most honest I've ever been with someone while dating. I'm grateful that he was honest, and I know I should be proud of myself for prompting this kind of exchange (it's one of the things I wanted to clarify on the phone, if possible). But somehow I still feel terrible.

Some of this emotional energy is probably spillover from a breakup in the spring with someone who was ""afraid of commitment,"" who made me feel very anxious, despite our getting along very well as friends and in bed. I think I'm probably healed up enough from that to date but not enough to brush off failures quickly.

Sharing because sometimes these victories ring hollow. I know that I did the right thing in terms of attachment, because in the past I've been willing to ""go with the flow"" and ended up feeling awful about not stating my needs to myself or the other person. But now I don't get to have the fun parts of seeing someone. Yes, I have plenty else going on in my life and I know that dating isn't the cure for loneliness, but sometimes I wish I were emotionally suited to settle for the casual version.

I’m thinking of starting some sort of club/support group for those of us dealing with an anxious attachment, and particularly those who are in the process of getting over a breakup and attempting to heal before dating again! 

The inspiration for this idea comes from how I’m sick and tired of being on the extreme end of anxious preoccupied. I’d love to be able to meet once a week on zoom or clubhouse or some other platform and talk about what it’s like to deal with an anxious attachment style, to heal and move on from a break up, to grieve the loss of a relationship, etc. We can also collectively read books (about attachment theory, relationships, and healing) and discuss them and share what we think of their content and message. 

Upvote this and lmk if you’re interested! I’ll make another post if I end up following through with this idea. 
Let’s have a healing summer!

Edit: wow! Thank you everyone for supporting the idea! I’ll get started working on it, and I’ll make another post with the details/form to sign up :) I’ll personally message those who commented as well. So if you want to make sure you’re updated, don’t forget to drop a comment. 💙",nlvwwh,48,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/nlvwwh/ap_breakup_healing_club/,AnxiousAttachment,1
615,Some DAs are also narcissists and are not worth pursuing a relationship with.,"There’s a pattern of AA/FA getting involved with DAs, we trigger each other and we’re not all perfectly secured. However, some of these DAs out there are just narcissists and will drain you without you realizing it. From personal experience, AA/FAs seem to be more willing to fix themselves or are more likely to be HSPs or empathetic. These are breeding grounds for narcissists disguised as DAs to take advantage and use you.

616,Anxiety or gut feeling?,"Anyone else struggles with differentiating and separating your gut feelings from intrusive and anxious thoughts? 

I honestly believe in trusting your instincts and your gut feeling when they say that something feels off. 

But struggling with anxiety has made this more difficult, as I don’t know if it’s my gut feeling warning me that something is wrong or it’s my intrusive and anxious thoughts and i should try and control them.

Any input on the matter would be appreciated :)",lkbl2a,46,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/lkbl2a/anxiety_or_gut_feeling/,AnxiousAttachment,1
617,Shutting our needs away for others,"So I am an anxious attachment, now I am out of quite a difficult relationship I am not so bad as I was but something still frustrates me to no end, especially all these “relationship experts” on TikTok… something my avoidant ex once said “if you have respect for me you will give me space and leave me alone”, as many of you will probably expect, this triggered me. I did leave him alone and didn’t reach out but it did make me think.. why do we have to live being triggered and our needs unmet while others get their needs met. Isn’t it disrespectful for my partner not have MY needs met? Why is there this mindset that as an anxious we have to give other people space and suffer ourselves, why can’t it be seen as acceptable to have a middle ground where both parties have space and some level of communication? Why does the anxious have to bend backwards for the avoidant and it is seen as disrespectful to expect something in return.",12yi511,49,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/12yi511/shutting_our_needs_away_for_others/,AnxiousAttachment,1

619,"Coming up to 3 months NC with my DA ex, here are some of the lessons I’ve learned so far, which I hope will help some of you in similar situations.","The background to my story is available in some of my earlier posts.

First things first, healing truly isn’t linear. I still have bad days, but they’re getting fewer and fewer. 

At the beginning, I thought about her every waking moment (and some sleeping moments). Now it’s just the odd sucker punch. A song that reminds me of her, someone wearing the same perfume. 

There was a time when these sucker punches would absolutely floor me. I’ve had to leave shops before when some little thing triggered me to think of her. Now, I get a little pang of sadness and then I brush it off. That’s progress, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come. 

My feelings still fluctuate between guilt at some of my behaviour, sadness at what could have been, anger at the way I was treated by her. The second lesson is that every emotion is valid and it’s okay to feel them all. Human relationships are messy, complicated things and they rarely have neat endings. 

I sadly did attempt to reach out once, to see if she’d be willing to have a ‘closure’ talk with me. She never replied. And that’s the third lesson, one that I’ve had to hash out with my therapist. You can’t make people give you the closure you need, and a lot of the time you won’t be happy with what they have to say anyway. I have had to learn that the closure I seek has to come from me and me alone. I have to be comfortable with the fact that I may never speak to her again. I’m not there yet but I will be, eventually. 

Love and strength to everyone who’s going through this. My messages are always open if anyone needs to talk.",yv3gzy,47,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/yv3gzy/coming_up_to_3_months_nc_with_my_da_ex_here_are/,AnxiousAttachment,1
620,i was only able to fix my attachment style only when I got into a romantic relationship,"Hey guys I do believe loving yourself is essential and things like that although I'm secure in my friendships and things like that the only way I was able to fix my issue is when I got into a long term relationship with someone. I do think everyone is different and we should all be become secure in certain areas in your life while that's friendships or family relationships. 

But the relationship part only got fixed when I actually found my person and was able to work through them while I was actually being triggered.

For me personally it didn't work fixing them when I was single because I wasn't getting triggered at all and didn't know what all my triggers were.  As a person who went through sexual abuse me being in a relationship with someome I trust was the only thing that helped me finally deal with my triggers along with my therapist.

624,"Both Anxious AND Avoidant Are ""Needy""","AP tend to externalize their needs through communication and protest behaviours. Avoidants tend to  internalize their needs and shut down. The only difference between them is that the AP's needs require the other person while the avoidant doesn't. 

This one sided dynamic gives the avoidant full control over the relationship, as a result they often become entitled regarding their own needs while being blind to the AP's needs.

Things can only happen if the avoidant allows it, they're constantly suppressing their emotions so even if they will be devastated in the grieving process, they have little to no qualms with ending the relationship in that moment. 

Whenever the AP becomes disinterested in the relationship and considers leaving,  this is when the dynamic flips and the AP is the one in the control. This is when the avoidant activates and suddenly does a 180 on their cold behaviour to convince the AP to stay.

This is not sustainable at all however, for a time the AP may supress their own needs at best but this will turn to resentment. These relationships become so toxic towards the end because one or both sides aren't having their needs met and it usually ends with the AP getting discarded after setting a boundary or expectation onto the avoidant or the AP gets fed up and walks away permanently.  

 AP/A relationships rarely work, even secures tend to leave because avoidant behaviour is seen as disrespectful and ""needy"" to anyone without insecurity. 

This is why you should work towards being secure and find a mutually secure partner, there is nothing wrong with having needs so long as you go about it in a healthy way, you also have the option to leave a situation if someone else's boundaries come at your expense.",w6mqxy,47,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/w6mqxy/both_anxious_and_avoidant_are_needy/,AnxiousAttachment,1

626,I become obsessive in relationships and it's wrecking my life. I hate this.,"I have an anxious attachment disorder, caused by a very lonely childhood where I mostly lived inside my head. It was just myself and my mother, who did provide well, but she welcomed my clinginess and could be neglectful, confusing and aggressive too.

There was no communication skills or emotional intelligence in the house, and I had to teach myself social skills from scratch when I was a teen - I would mostly only communicate in funny noises or be too shy to say anything.  I would get petrified if my Mum came back home late without saying anything, and I would get jealous and confused with her multiple boyfriends who would appear without warning or context. 

I've spent my adult life desperate for connection, often overwhelmed and anxious with every relationship I've ever had. 

I'm incredibly perceptive when things in a relationship have changed. I always know if a girlfriend is going off me, and I hate the thought of this power change. I become obsessed with my phone, desperate for a WhatsApp message. I am overjoyed and happy when a partner messages me, but get anxious and terrified when they don't. 

I live on edge when I think the whole thing might be the end, I can't concentrate and have a mental breakdown.  If there is an important 'just need to chat' relationship phone call or meeting, I go out of my mind needing to know where I stand with that person.

I relish a personal or sexual connection and I become desperate for it not to end.

Oddly enough, weeks after a breakup, I'm usually ok - but then the same thing keeps happening, over and over again when I meet someone new.",vi442b,47,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vi442b/i_become_obsessive_in_relationships_and_its/,AnxiousAttachment,1

I never got a response from him, and honestly didn’t expect to. It didn’t bother me until yesterday, when I started hurting for not getting a response and wondering if he just didn’t care about me. 

I just wanted to say that, even though a part of me wants to reach out to try and get a reaction from him, I’m letting that thought come and go and grounding myself in the fact that even if HE didn’t respect me, I respected myself by letting him go and moving on. I’m taking my time, I’m crying, I’m mourning and sometimes I think of his kiss before I go to sleep, I remember what it felt like laying on his chest. 

And you know the best part of it? When I’m ready, I’ll fall in love again, and I’ll have all of that again, but this time with someone that truly respects and loves me. Meanwhile, I’ll take care of myself, love myself, cry, eat delicious food, work, watch random tv shows, connect with friends and family. Life is good and we deserve better.

629,Thought exercise: Walk us through the rest of your life if you were to never experience a long-term romantic relationship again,"I watched a video on catastrophizing the other day. It opened my eyes to how I play out the worst case scenario in my head and then operate based on that anxiety. 


I think a lot of us with this attachment style can relate to the fear of abandonment or being alone forever. In my experience, I’ve walked myself through that story in the following steps:


1. I’m alone forever 

2. I never feel love, warmth, or validation directed towards me in a romantic way 

3. I never feel that spark again. I never have that special connection again

4. I’ll be miserable and alone and miss out on ever feeling true happiness again. I won’t get to live life to my fullest potential. I’ll always be longing for more. 


I realized this is a hell of a story to tell myself. Will I actually be single forever? No, I highly doubt that. But if I were single forever, what are the best, worst, and most likely scenarios? I’ve already covered my Worst Scenario above.


The Best Case scenario is I live like the Golden Girls with my best friends into old age and never feel any doubts or loneliness again. 


What is the *Most Likely* scenario if I were to never have a long-term romantic relationship again? 

1. I’m single for the rest of my life

2. I still have meaningful, platonic relationships and I will make more wonderful friends someday who I haven’t even met yet 

3. Sometimes I’ll feel lonely and doubtful about my love life. These feelings won’t last forever. 

4. I will get better at sitting with and noticing my emotions without catastrophizing or using them to make decisions about my potential for love. Sometimes these emotions will feel too strong and I will feel really sad, but they’ll pass, as all emotions do. I’ll use my tools (meditation, journaling, self-talk), talk with someone I trust, cry on my dog, or wallow for a bit. Then I will begin to feel okay again. 

5. I will learn ways to fill my time with things I enjoy

6. I will live a fulfilling life full of connection and experiences. Some will be uncomfortable and some will be very pleasant and some will lie somewhere in between. I’ll still experience many types of love and fulfilling connection. And maybe I’ll still get to live my Golden Girls fantasy 😂


Walking myself through different scenarios helped me visualize how heavy the negative narrative can be. It can hold so much power over you because your body is reacting as if it’s already happening and as if it is able to 100% predict the future. 


Even with a relationship, I don’t think my life should really change much from my Most Likely scenario. Logically, I know a romantic relationship won’t replace uncomfortable feelings or experiences. It can’t make me secure. Only I can make meaningful steps to work towards security, no one else can replace my anxiety. Examples of secure, healthy relating will be good for me to learn from when I come across them, but that won’t “fix” me either. And if I’m never fully “fixed”, I will still experience many amazing, uncomfortable, and neutral things. And I still have every right to turn down something that isn’t right for me, even if I’m not “fixed”. I deserve better than settling for scraps. Sometimes I’ll forget or doubt that. But I can always make a change and remember that there’s no sense in abandoning myself for another person when it just leads to misery and confusion. 


When I feel lonely, I have to remember that discomfort is not because I’m single. It’s just a normal part of the human experience and it can teach me a lot about my needs and being able to sit with discomfort. I shouldn’t settle for less than what makes me happy because I’m afraid that being alone is worse than being with someone who doesn’t make me consistently feel seen, heard, understood, and cared about. 


**I sometimes see commenters here talking about being alone forever, so I wanted to post about a thought exercise that has helped me when this fear pops into my head. If you’re comfortable trying this out, imagine you’re single for the rest of your life: walk us through the best, worst, and most likely scenarios.**",td08lg,49,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/td08lg/thought_exercise_walk_us_through_the_rest_of_your/,AnxiousAttachment,1
630,Anyone anxiously attached but act like a DA?,"Does anyone have all the thoughts, belief and urges of an AA but doesn’t act on them?

I want to spam my partners with texts and spend every minute of them and tell them I love them but I physically can’t. That would be admitting my feelings and I see that as needy, pathetic and weak. I’ve also got the fear that if people know how I really feel they’ll be able to control me. 

I desperately crave and emotional connection and will have deep conversations with my partners but I feel like the stuff I’m sharing is selected as the person I’m trying to portray. I’m never actually revealing anything true about myself. 

I to breakup with my partners, ignore their texts and never reach out/make plans but it’s not because I need space. It’s because I feel like I have to.

Is there any other AAs like this? Everyone says I’m FA but I just feel like I’m AA. I’ve never wanted space from my partner unless it’s a manipulative technique. I do tend to only date avoidants though so maybe that’s why I feel more AA and I’d be a lot more dismissive with an anxious.",sgzimc,47,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/sgzimc/anyone_anxiously_attached_but_act_like_a_da/,AnxiousAttachment,1

632,HELP. I feel like I always attract emotionally unavailable people and it triggers my anxiety.,"I re entered the dating pool this year and have a pattern where a guy will come across very strong, emotionally connecting with me and once I start to reciprocate they pull away and I'm left picking up the pieces. A little about me, I have been in a relatively healthy long term relationship before, I have a few very close friends, family, multiple acquaintances, my social life is fun, I'm adventurous, and it seems like a lot of men find me attractive. I've had to work on myself a lot over the years due to a past history of having a narcissistic mother, sexual assault, the death of my father who I was very close with and other forms of abandonment and I think there are a lot of subconscious influences at play.

I don't know if this is a pattern in me where I am attracting avoidant people, but it feels like extreme hot and colds and it's giving me anxiety. I notice I tend to attract men in a ""girlfriend experience"" way where they seem to want to play out this girlfriend fantasy for a little bit and then they're done. It's like I'm this vessel for them to project this idea of something they want but once I show more of who I am or how I feel it becomes too real and they bounce. It’s been to the point where I almost feel like maybe how a woman hired to give a man company feels like, like it’s shallow and filling a shallow void for someone else, it’s not very deep or real even though at the beginning I’m all in and whole heartedly think it is. This in turn triggers extreme anxiety and hyper-vigilance in me that can completely derail my thought patterns. It's typically a man who comes on too strong too soon, over discloses his life story, we cross some sort of boundary in hindsight too soon (i.e. sleeping with each other, he feels comfortable telling me extremely personal things way too soon), etc. I fall hard and get wrangled in despite the red flags, they suck me dry emotionally like a vampire, and once I'm starting to settle in, they leave. I'm typically extremely attracted to them, and I find them interesting and a cool person in other ways - it's not all red flags going on at all, in a lot of ways I find these people pretty compatible with me except they are not emotionally available or all there.

I'm not the anxious type that will really show that I'm anxiously attached. It's incredibly difficult for me, but I hide it pretty well to the point where I think some people think I'm avoidant or people think I am so chill I don't have high standards. Sometimes I wonder if the guy thinks I'm not interested because I might over correct or eventually don't hide it as well and he can sense there's more going on under the surface and withdraws.

The first time it happened after my last breakup I was devastated and it totally derailed me. We met online, talked for months getting to know each other and he led me to believe we really had something special. Finally, we ended up meeting, we hooked up and he immediately ghosted me after that. It took me months to recover to the point where I almost felt like I didn't want to exist anymore the pain was awful.

Fast forward to now. I met another guy and feel like a part inside of me is looking out saying ""here we go again..."" but my emotions and yearning for intimacy again are carrying me away. This guy felt comfortable over disclosing a lot of his past trauma right on the first date, came across very strong emotionally almost to the point of clinginess, but aside from that I thought he was a really interesting, nice and otherwise compatible person and continued to hang out with him. I ended up catching feelings for him and every time we've hung out it's been intense but really nice but I feel like I’m starting to get the usual mixed signals. All of this is triggering intense feelings that he's just looking for a warm body, and that I'm not really someone special he wants to get to know and it's making me question so many things.

Another weird part of this, the guys will usually have kind of odd personalities almost to the point where it seems like they're not neurotypical and sometimes they'll even express that to me. I am attracted to different kind of people, but sometimes I feel like I'm attracted to people who emotionally are not normal / possibly even on the spectrum or have past trauma that doesn't allow them to feel like a normal person. (my father was a bit like this so I wonder if it has to do with that). It’s like how in the heck am I being so sensitive and emotional as I am getting looped in with dudes who don’t really feel feelings at least not in a normal/ predictable way. That sounds like it’s doomed from the start. And why do I feel like I should give or win approval to these people. 

Anyways I know this is A LOT but I couldn't sleep and just want to feel ok :(. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Additional thought: I kind of wonder if I’m so people pleasing in such a subtle way that I create this kind of artificially welcoming experience to create that intimacy I so crave that makes people kind of spill the beans maybe even before they’re ready. I often feel like guys will say “I can’t believe I’m telling you this” or things like that and afterwards I feel like they feel shame/ regret and feel weird about me and that they gave that part of themselves away too soon and don’t understand why they did. I am not really saying this is an overt tactic I’ve perfected and I don’t have bad intentions by doing it but I kind of had an epiphany around that. For example I’m unusually good at sales, especially for being more on the introverted side and I think it’s because I can be really disarming up front and can get people to easily trust me. I’ve been told this a lot. Unfortunately building a solid long term relationship has nothing to do with disarming. I’ve just gotten really good at breaking those initial barriers with people but need to improve on the rest :(",p6nrfb,45,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/p6nrfb/help_i_feel_like_i_always_attract_emotionally/,AnxiousAttachment,1

636,what are some advantages about having an anxious attachment?,"don't get me wrong, insecure attachment styles, wether anxious, dissmisive-avoidant or fearful-avoidant, are not healthy and anyone can (and should) aim to become more secure.

I am AP (FA leaning) and noticed that there are also some advantages of being AP.

#**Workplace:**
• Likely to detect and alert others to 
  workplace problems

• Open to working and communicating as 
  part of a team

• Willing to seek support from a team and 
  trust in others

• Likely to work hard to achieve a positive
  outcome 

• Compliant in the workplace

• Continuously evaluate their performance    
   and quality of work

#**Romantic relationships:**
• Devote themselves to relationships fully

• Fall in love easily

• Willing to work on relationships

• Highly attuned to their partner’s needs

• Help partners to see themselves  
  positively 

#**Platonic relationships/friendships:**
• Crave closeness and connectedness with friends

• Can be friendly and accepting

• Act as the caretaker within groups

• Work hard at maintaining friendships

637,How to handle the anxiety of seeing my partner less?,"Hey everyone,

My partner and I had a chat yesterday where he expressed his view that we should spend time with each other a little bit less. We currently spend almost all our time together - we don’t live together but I see him every day, I’m always at his place, most of our time together is idle time rather than actually making plans. 

He expressed that for a few reasons, including wanting more time to do productive things (he’s self employed), he thinks we shouldn’t spend so much idle time together and we should instead plan 1-2 more intentional dates a week. 

I totally understand his thinking, and I can see that it’s a really positive thing that he felt comfortable communicating with me that something wasn’t working for him. I want to respect his boundary. 

However since he told me this, my abandonment wound has been triggered, and I’ve been feeling so much anxiety about handling this. 

My fear isn’t necessarily a fear of being separate, because when things are really good between him and I, I actually enjoy my personal time and have a lot of hobbies and things I enjoy doing with other friends. 

I’m more afraid of the feeling of rejection when we would normally be spending time together, knowing he would rather not spend time with me.

I start stalking his social media, his exes, his exes’ friends and family members. I try to look at their timelines of dating and when they were doing things compared to the timeline of when we do things. I compare how attentive he was to his exes compared to me. I compare and contrast how I look to how his exes look. I overanalyze every little thing he does, and question every intention he has with me. I second guess everything we built together.

We just went on our first trip together, first getaway trip, and we had such a great time. So much love and amazing connection. We did all these fun things together, overall we just had a really great time and yet I can’t help but feel that he doesn’t actually take me seriously in his life. I just feel like he’s only putting me into a girlfriend role and he doesn’t actually like me and want a future with me. He just wants anyone at this point and someone to be there to fulfill his need of having a girlfriend. He’s so used to having a girlfriend because of his exes that I’m nothing special to him. A trip with me isn’t anything special because he’s done trips with girls plenty of times before.

My anxiety is ruining these otherwise amazing things occurring in my life right now. I have an awesome guy, who I love, and yet my brain is sabotaging it. My coping mechanisms only go so far to relieve it. Eventually it’ll fade and I’ll feel leagues better, but then the cycle will start again and I’m right back to it. Just lost and don’t know what to do.",163w4d0,48,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/163w4d0/why_do_i_always_feel_heightened_levels_of_anxiety/,AnxiousAttachment,1
639,Guy i’ve been dating the last two months goes a week without texting me - pattern,"Guy I’ve been dating for last two months (been on five dates and spoke about building towards a relationship so we’re both on the same page) has been taking around a week to respond to my messages. When he does respond it’s with

‘That could be fun! Sorry the last few weeks have been insane both in work load and unnecessary drama. Sorry I’ve been mia’

And 

‘Crazy week, I shoot my personal final project on Tuesday so sorry I’ve been MIA’

Last time we met in person I asked him what he liked about me and one of the things he mentioned was ‘i like that you don’t get upset that I can’t immediately respond to you’ which i thought felt like conditioning.

I guess my question is: is it normal or okay to go a week between texts in the initial stages of dating? Would this be a red flag for you all? Personally, It would be a nonnegotiable for me if we were ever in a relationship

640,I am all about protest behavior,"I just finished Attached and I realized I am a walking example of Protest behavior- literally everything they mentioned there is my normal me. This is going to be challenging for me to change, idk how I am going to consciously reprogram myself to not do a protest behavior and stay calm and collected to express my needs, it sounds challenging. 
Has anyone else felt this way? 

But I kept thinking : 

- someone not texting or communicating for several days isn't normal.

- Someone constantly told to be slightly caring and invested isn't normal 

- Someone doing the bare minimum in a relationship and expect me to not react isn't normal. 

So even if I did change my protest behavior, given the scenario with my Ex, it wouldn't have helped or maybe it would have idk. Definitely changing my communication style is my most effective take away from this book, but also to be willing to walk away when my needs are not met after the issue has been communicated..

The book says don't leave things to fate! I feel this is a lot of work :(",11yvw8c,46,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11yvw8c/i_am_all_about_protest_behavior/,AnxiousAttachment,1

642,"I thought I was getting better, but I absolutely failed today.","Anytime I start to talk to someone in a romantic way, my anxiety kicks in immediately.

I've read so much about it, meditated, watched myself, listened to my emotions, built up a life that doesn't involve a partner, have a lot of interests and friends and hobbies. Found happiness within myself. I've been single and happy for 3 years and I've enjoyed every second of it.

But last month I met someone and we've been talking pretty much non stop. We've gone out on multiple dates, have plenty of future plans, we've had sex multiple times, we say romantic things to each other, we play online games when we're not physically together, we talk pretty much every day from morning to bed time. It's been a great time. However we are not ""official"" nor have we committed to each other or talked about exclusivity.

But after 6 weeks of doing that, today they didn't message me at all for almost the entire day, which is unprecedented. I told myself I wouldn't message them, I'll stay strong. But I was an absolute wreck all day. I kept thinking to myself ""is this it? Did I say something wrong? Their vibe was off last night too..."" I broke and checked their ""last online"" status and they hadn't even been ""online"" for 13 hours. I kept saying to myself ""omg are they with someone else? We're not exclusive or anything, they might be on a date with someone else."" 

I felt my brain going crazy all day. I couldn't concentrate on work. I tried to take my mind off them but they always popped back in. I told myself I wouldn't message them because it would only be out of insecurity. I kept listening to podcasts and audiobooks about anxious attachment style, and it fits me to a T. I tried to blast music while working, and felt nothing. Absolutely nothing worked. I started to feel suffocated. But I told myself to hold strong. I wrote a LOOONG diatribe on my phone notepad about how I felt. I could feel myself spiraling and I kept repeating to myself ""they are not responsible for my happiness. Happiness comes from within. My peace and calm will not depend on them."" I knew that the only thing that could calm me was them reassuring me, and I told myself that I do not want their reassurance, I do not want their validation, I want to feel okay because I feel okay, not because they messaged me.

I left work early and went for an outdoor walk to clear my head. I hated the way I felt, I hated feeling dependent on them. I hated that I knew that as soon as they messaged me, I'd feel okay again. 

But I broke. I sent them a quick ""Hope you're having a great day!"" text. A few minutes later they texted me back and started validating and reassuring me as if they knew how I was feeling. Talking cute like always, telling me about their day, about our future plans, gushing over me, and all the cuteness that they are as if nothing ever happened. 

Obviously I felt much better about that, but at the same time I felt like an absolutely failure because I couldn't even go 1 day without their reassurance and validation. The only lifeboat I could cling on to is that I didn't act insecure around them asking ""why haven't you texted me, whats wrong, are you okay, did i say something wrong"" type of stuff.

But that feeling I felt all day I hated going through. It felt awful, and I don't know if I can continue if I'm gonna feel that way because they didn't text me for 1 afternoon. It's almost not even worth it. The highest highest bring the lowest lows and I feel like a failure.",11ncq8i,47,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11ncq8i/i_thought_i_was_getting_better_but_i_absolutely/,AnxiousAttachment,1

644,I think I'm developing avoidant tendencies,"And for good reason. Not too long ago I made a post about being happy only talking once a week and I got told this actually isn't healthy. It worked out in this case because the distance helped me quickly realize my crush was actually stringing me along.

So I asked for clarity, got confirmation that they didn't actually like me and I proceeded to unfriend them and stop talking. Had I not have this distance in place and talked more often, I would've gotten too attached and would not have been able to cut them off this quickly.

However, I see this going down a bad path. I'm slowly becoming more pessimistic about people. All of the toxic behavior I keep dealing with from people (getting drained by anxious types and abandoned by avoidant types) is making me want to close up and not talk to anyone at all. 

Or at least keep them at a great distance so that can't zap my emotional resources. I'm not sure whetr I'm going with this, I just could use some encouragement. I'm just starting to feel like having connections with people at all is too hard and too painful..",10o2qek,46,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10o2qek/i_think_im_developing_avoidant_tendencies/,AnxiousAttachment,1
645,"ghosted by DA ex lover, one year later.","Hey everyone :) 

I'm Gary. 

A year ago i got blindsided and ghosted by a female DA. I was very hurt, anxious, and depressed for months. 

Eventually i got better, bit by bit, one step at a time. I learned to love myself (still a work in progress but it's a journey and not a destination), and because i am on said journey, i find myself a lot calmer and more mature. As a result, i met someone else whom i now have a relationship with. Ofc i was very scared of putting myself into a position again where i could get hurt, but the two conflicts she and i had have shown me that she's willing to communicate in order to dive into the heart of the matter, and i did so as well. 

As a result we actually grew closer. The conflicts, and honesty around them, made us grow closer. We trust each other more deeply now, and we feel it. 

I realized.. this is something I never ever would have had with a DA. It never would have happened. Never. 

So to anyone suffering from their break ups with a DA, you don't need to suffer. You don't control that person, and you can't make anyone change.. apart from yourself. A relationship with a DA is (usually) annoying and frustrating at best, and it will break your spirit at it's worst. There are other people out there whom are much better, believe it or not. 

So trust me.. grief if you must, but you will one day be thankful for being left.",yk23oa,45,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/yk23oa/ghosted_by_da_ex_lover_one_year_later/,AnxiousAttachment,1

__


You were too much, but only because I learned to dismiss my own needs for connection and dependency. I could not receive yours. 

I felt smothered because I didn't know how to hold space for you. No one held space for me when I was being needy. Why should I do that for anyone else?

I was afraid my own needs would be lost with yours. I thought it was selfish of you to impede on my independence. I thought that your needs were unreasonable, so I didn't even want to try meeting you halfway.

Now I know I was also selfish to assume my actions shouldn't affect you.

I said meaningless feedback like, ""Just become secure"" and thought you were the only one who needed to change. 

You told me before that it was my attitude that was hurting you. You called me a monster for dismissing your needs. You said you were tired of explaining what you needed over and over to me. I didn't understand. 

--

I hope this post validates some of you. My past relationship 5 years ago got emotionally and physically abusive at the end (he hit me and I got PTSD). I realized I contributed to my partner's anxiety by being dismissive in the beginning of the relationship. 

This is NOT an excuse for his abusive behavior. Those are his own demons. I'm just owning my part.

Before it got to that point, there were many discussions of him trying to talk to me about needs, intermittent reinforcement, resolving conflict, and me avoiding conversations, giving half assed solutions, and not really prioritizing his needs because I didn't really believe it was necessary for me to change. 

He wanted to break up a couple times, but we kept trying because I couldn't really let go of him and made promises I couldn't keep. I fully believed it was all on him to change because there is so much cultural support in America for, ""being independent, not needing anyone, I'm doing me, fuck anyone who restricts my energy.""

A year after we broke up, I learned about the dependency paradox and attachment theory, and got a taste of my own medicine with someone else. My ex was legitimately a monster to me...and so was I to him. I fully sobbed when I fully realized that it wasn't just him causing me pain, but there was legitimate pain I caused to him too.

650,(respectfully) why can avoidants be so... mean?,"I'm looking back on my relationship with my ex partner, a DA man. And when he deactivated, he would become very critical of me and everything about our relationship. (I've three books on attachment styles and I recently started therapy and from what I learned, this is very common for avoidants to do).

But the way it's done. It's so awful and could leave ANYONE feeling bad, even secure people. The things he would criticise about me made no sense in hindsight. Especially when those would be the things that he would praise if things were going well. The harshness, the brutality of his tone. And the friends I've met who have dated avoidants have all said the same thing; that when deactivation occurred, they would be so brutal about it. (Yet from the short time I've been on Reddit, it seems as APs get a bad rep). Another thing was the thing he would do like flirting with others or not taking our boundaries seriously. It was all so awful.

I'm mainly disappointed in myself for having tolerated it. But I corrected that by walking away and choosing better for myself in the form of being single and going to therapy. So I'm learning a lot about myself too.

So this isn't as if I think avoidants are bad or anything.

652,A checklist for the anxiously attached partner,"Hey everyone,

being in a relationship can sometimes be very challenging for an insecure attached partner. While no one is perfect it is also no secret that insecure partners can put stress on the relationship due to unhealthy behaviors.  However, it is not always as easy as one would like to notice one's own bad behaviors. Hence I have decided to create the following checklist to enable an anxious attached partner to better gain important insight in their own actions and behaviors.

This checklist can, of course, be taken no matter what your relationship status is. That is, if you are in a long term relationship, initial stages of a relationship, a situationship or single (by looking back at one of your more recent relationships). The checklist is written with the perspective of anxious partners and not avoidant or secure.

I personally would suggest you to take this or other similar checklists regularly (maybe make your own), how often is up to you. I would also strongly suggest you to write down all the points in the checklist and your answer to better gain an overall picture. If you take this checklist regularly writing down your answer could also be used to compare results and possibly see improvements or deteriorations.

***Disclaimer***

In no way am I trying to badmouth anxiously attached people. I am also not trying, in any way, putting the blame for any relationship issues on the anxious partner alone. I am well aware that unhealthy behaviors done by anxious partners can be a result of their partners unacceptable behavior as well. The intention of this post is solely to help and anxious partner the better realize how and where in their relationship that they need to improve to become more secure.

***Checklist format***

The checklist contains of 5 subcategories that each contains a couple of points. The part in brackets following each point is to make it easier for you to answer the questions in each point more correctly. It is also very useful to answer the questions in the brackets but these do not contribute to the score.

***Scoring***

For each point you can answer the question in 4 different ways. Answer each point in the way that best describe how you relate with the questions in each point. Each answer gives points (+ or -) which enables you to calculate a common score after you have answered all points. You are only suppose to answer once for each point even if the point contains more than one question.

The 4 different answers are:

**I strongly relate** relate to the questions in the point. I feel the emotions or think the thoughts described at least once per week (Score: +2)

**I relate** to the questions in the point. I feel the emotions or think the thoughts described at least once per month (Score: +1)

**I don't relate** to the questions in the point. I feel the emotions or think the thoughts only a couple of times each year (Score: -1)

**I absolutely don't relate** to the questions in the point. I have never felt the emotions or thought the thoughts described or have only encountered them a handful amount of times in my entire lifetime (Score: -2)

***Scoring and results***

Please note that the results of this checklist is not to be taken too seriously since this checklist is far from enough to explain anything about you or your relationship. This is simply generalizations and you yourself should be able to realize whether or not the statements below applies to you and your relationship.

***-32 to -11***

You don't tend to let your emotions get the better of you and have a greater ability to self soothe. All though you necessarily aren't perfect (no one are) you have a good possibility to enter a secure relationship where your anxious attachment is unlikely to greatly interfere or affect the relationship in a negative way. Keep up the good work!

***-10 to +10***

Even though you seem to be able to keep your emotions in somewhat control there are still some work to be done. You are on a good trajectory to become more secure in yourself and in your relationships. However there are likely some parts in your attachment that could unfortunately still affect your relationship negatively. Keep working on yourself to get rid of those last anxious tendencies!

***+11 to +32***

Unfortunately you seem to have quite some work left to do. You seem to still be unable to regain emotional control or self soothe in the majority of times and if no improvements is to happen you unfortunately have a bigger risk of letting your attachment affect your relationships in a negative way. However, nothing is lost and you, like anyone else, can work on yourself to become more secure! Please don't feel bad about yourself and realize that you are not solely to blame for your anxious tendencies. Please also remember that it is possible that you would score lower with a partner that would be more emotionally available.

***Final words***

I am far from an expert on attachment styles but I still hope that this checklist can give you some important insight on your own attachment issues and what parts that you could improve.

Lastly, please feel free to add more points in the comment below that you think I missed and I might add them to the list!

653,Taking Things Personally and Trying to Understand the Secure Perspective - A Diary Entry,"This is long, but I wanted to post in case anyone can relate or has any related thoughts to share. It's a diary entry I wrote recently. Let me know if this resonates with you.

.

I am royally obsessed with understanding. It prevents me from enjoying the present. To not understand is to have all security utterly stripped away. 
Why? 
I don't know. 
What I do know is that it comes from a need for control and predictability. If I feel in control and I can predict a person, I feel safe. I don't feel safe in relationships without this.

If I do not have the upper hand on being nurturing, understanding, patient and forgiving, then I struggle to feel worthy and loveable. 
Why?
I don't know.
What I do know is, I'm realising that I don't trust people to love me properly. I am constantly waiting and expecting to be let down. At the closest sign of discontent, whether it be personal or not, I instantly go into crisis management mode. I say to myself ""of course they're failing to love me! I always knew they wouldn't love me properly! Now how do I manage this situation so I can get them to change and love me 'properly'?"". I instantly start planning how I will communicate this. And with exhaustion, I again accept that I have to, once more, try to train someone how to love me right.

I give people no chance to resolve an issue on their own or in their own way before I jump and take full managerial control of the situation.

I always take these situations personally. My subconscious says ""This issue must be about me because I am inherently unloveable"".
But what if it's not personal? 
What if, in fact, their behaviour has nothing to do with me? 
What if, actually, I am hijacking their own problem, assuming it's about me, needlessly criticising and then holding resentment?
Now that's a hard pill to swallow. 

I think a secure person would be aware of a partners change in behaviour and instead NOT assume it is because of them. They probably wouldn't spend all of their time rumenating, psycho-analysing and building resentment. It may even just be a passing thing they notice and in knowing their worth, not take it personally. Maybe they even give the issue time, to see if it resolves itself. 

I'm realising now that I do not give ANY, even minor, issues time to resolve themselves before I go into crisis management mode. Worst still, I give my partner no time, trust or faith that they might resolve the issue either. 

What if, instead, I just told my partner ""I noticed this, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about but I was wondering what your perspective was on it?""
What if, I lead with trust? Better still, what if I kept it even simpler and didn't say anything?

The problem here lies and this is where the real difficulty arises for me; How to know when it's personal and when it isn't? How to know when it's important enough to broach and solve? This is a question I'm still struggling to answer. But I guess, with trust and security, you don't worry about these questions. You know your worth and you trust that your partner will treat you right and you, yourself, also try to do the same. Perhaps, even, the secure person might not worry about these questions but instead, are focused on being the best version of themselves. Perhaps they are focused only on their own role in the relationship. They trust and expect the best from their partner and focus on their own self and their own role as a partner. They do not assume that they must predict their partners behaviours. They do not hijack their partners agency in how they are going to treat you. 

I truly, truly hope one day I can get there. I hope one day this hypothetical secure person that I write of becomes first-person, becomes me. Or better, I become them.

654,Taking a break in a relationship CAN be helpful,"I am AA/AP 43m, my Gf FA33 Have  been together for 1 year, Right before the year mark, she tells me she wants to break up.. why on earth I asked, She says it's become too much, Over time she got so accustomed to my needs of being validated, replied to, acknowledged that she had a hard time focusing on her life and career .  I suggest that we take a break, as this was the third close to break up situation it was a last resort for us. She agreed to try. No contact for 2 weeks. It wasn't easy for one as Anxious as I, let me tell you. But we hit two weeks, then I gave it a couple more days. Why not? I'd already showed her that I could last this time without contact, why not go the distance.  I started with a simple open ended text, About the snow we just received. She replied, but I restrained myself, rather than take that as an invitation to bomb her with texts, I miss you! when can we talk! where do we meet! love me! I waited for her reply, even if it was all day. baby steps. The last thing I wanted to do was scare her off again. What I had realized during that break, was that we experienced an Enmeshment. She was so caught up in meeting my emotional needs, and making sure she checked in, or relied eventually, a good morning every morning, a good night every night, keeping score of calling, etc, she lost track of where she ended and I started.. we aren't LDR but we don't get to see each other too often, so a lot of this was over text or phone. But what had happened was she lost her sense of self, and as a FA, that is one of their biggest fears.  Unlike me, who abandons himself constantly, she has worked hard to be herself and losing that made her want to take flight.  Not to mention, that model of a relationship is just NOT sustainable. I couldn't try to force us to stay in the honeymoon phase forever..

In other words, love had become a chore, It wasn't something we wanted to do, but that we had to do. 

So we finally met for dinner and decided to give it another shot.  I decided to do my best to become more secure.  some small changes I've made include: Not expecting that good morning text every day. You can't expect to be someone's first thought of the day every day, You're more than likely on their list of firsts anyway. 

Stop being available all day every day.  Don't rush to reply to every text, Don't send backup texts to remind them to read your original text. Look, I didn't text her for two weeks and guess what? She didn't forget I existed! She didn't Lose my number! in fact...she probably missed me a little bit. Because she showed up to dinner and even agreed to a soft reset of sorts.

Respect the space. I don't have to be on her mind all the time, she doesn't have to be on mine. You'll both be there when you get back.  If you don't hear from your SO for a while, they haven't moved on with their life without you, They're busy being themselves, like you should be doing.  You want them to miss you, They can't miss you until you aren't there. Longing for one happens in the spaces between being present. Let the space and the silence between you two be a garden where you cultivate love. 

Don't be passive aggressive. Not even a little bit. If something is upsetting you, talk it out, be honest. Even if you have to ask your partner ""I could use a little more BLANK in our relationship, is that something we can work on?"" you would be surprised how effective a little direct conversation can be. 

Respond, Don't react. before jumping to conclusions, or making accusations, or assuming the very worst about someone, pause and ask yourself ""what would a secure person do?"" For all you tappers out there, you can also ask ""What age am I acting right now?"" take a moment and respond with your head, not react with your heart.

There's always money in the banana stand.  Don't look so deep into things, or read between every line, or ask yourself ""what did she mean by that?"".  Someone can't be there for you exactly the way you want them to every time.  Don't check the last time he called and for how long you talked to gauge if you are being ignored. Texts make this more difficult because you can't read the person through a text. And don't take for granted what you have with this person, after all you somehow got someone to love or at least really like your anxiously attached ass, don't ruin it for yourself by letting that ass do the talking, 

Be that person that He or she fell for in the first place.  This is self explanatory, you guys need to come together as two individuals, not one enmeshment of two. I was raised by a present but emotionally distant father and a smothering mother., So I learned that love meant NO boundaries, ever. And that the presence of the most basic boundary is an act of resentment and abandonment.   NOOOO, if anything else, You have to learn to build boundaries and respect them. Everyone loves different, learn your lovers love language. what you recieve as a 4, might be an effort of 8 on their part. 

Well, those are the major points, Sorry if this rambles or whatever, I'm pretty stoned right now.         But I am sending good vibes to all my fellow anxious individuals, Be strong and don't give up on yourself.",m1ostp,45,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/m1ostp/taking_a_break_in_a_relationship_can_be_helpful/,AnxiousAttachment,1
655,What are reasonable boundaries from a partner?,"I (25F AP) really struggle with letting people walk all over me because im a people pleaser and don’t want others to leave my life. Im wondering if anyone has found the line with what boundaries from a partner are reasonable and which are toxic / generally avoidant.

Backstory, I was seeing this guy (for a year on and off) who would make boundaries that would trigger me. For example, they would experience times of high stress and ask for space (this is good) but it would be so sudden and they would disappear for weeks while still seeing and entertaining other friends. Recently this occurred and I Frankly blew up in a way I’m embarrassed about - my professing my feelings and really just not giving them the space. Now I feel as though I ruined everything.

656,Questioning if I made the right choice by ending it with someone who told me they weren’t ready for a relationship,"The title makes it sound simple, but hear me out. I’m (25M) fairly secure with some AP tendencies. I recently started seeing this guy (24M) for a few weeks ago. We connected instantly it felt like (our first date was literally 5.5 hours long) and had many amazing dates since. The first week of us going out, he mentioned that he wasn’t ready for a relationship. This is where my AP side comes in- I kind of ignored that and proceeded as usual. And he seemed to kind of reciprocate. I got triggered though when he went hours without answering my messages and eventually realized that I don’t think I could dive into something while feeling like I was running into a dead end of him not wanting something serious. After I told him this, he told me he felt like I didn’t respect what he wanted and the boundaries around that so it’s best to take a step back. Normally I’d understand that, but what confuses me is how great and long our dates were. There were literally dates where we spent a full 36 hours together and had an amazing time. The AP part of me wants to believe that if I just stuck it out, he’d fall for me (as silly as that sounds). Was I right in ending it?

657,Trying to create my own life. How did you do it?,"**CONTEXT:** Came across a brilliant thought exercise *“how would you design your life if I’m going to live my life without a romantic relationship”*. The problem I've had since starting is, I seem to have no desire to do much because of a lack of desire/interest or how much energy life takes from me. I am unsure if this is a defense mechanism or a reality. I do suspect it's a mixture. I am deaf & autistic & recovering from an eating disorder so life is mostly exhausting from surviving. Let alone the anxiety provoking experience of building new friendships. This is why/how relationships become a source of comfort. Issue is, that is not healthy either and I want to start creating a wider life. I am struggling the most with being A. patient with the slow progression of friendship/community/skill building. B. Knowing how to break that down and what it looks like (healthily).  


**QUESTION:** I desire to create a life outside of a romantic relationship/job. Wondering if anyone else has been there, done that and how they got out of this space?

660,Attached Review: From A Former Anxious Leaner's Perspective,"I have been wanting to post my review for ""Attached"" for a long time, and finally have the opportunity to do so. I'm FA that currently leans DA, but I used to be a FA that used to lean severely AP. This book happened to be the very first I've read on attachment theory, and it got me into it. Buckle up, this is going to be a through review. I plan on also reviewing other books on Attachment Theory as well. 😊

The Cons: 

1.) The book describing Codependency as a myth was a huge one for me. Codependency absolutely is problematic, and the way this book described it, and kinda blew the Codependency movement out of proportion was incredibly harmful and problematic. The Codependency movement is very helpful in all fronts, including relationships. It is NOT good to be codependent. Codependency is toxic, period. 

2.) The advice that you should avoid Avoidants (FA and DA) as a whole. That anxious attachers shouldn't be dating them or in relationships with them, and that they should be ""ruled out"" when dating. This is problematic because: 

1.) You can't know someone's true attachment style early on, unless maybe they were severely of that attachment style or something. You can't really truly know someone's attachment style until after the honeymoon phase is over. (Usually two years in, depending on the couple.) 

2.) Avoidants shouldn't be avoided. It is our responsibility to heal our own attachment style. (Support from our partner is helpful and I'm not condoning that, but we still need to be doing our own healing work. Avoidance is also a spectrum, like all the attachment styles are. Some avoidants are severe, some are mild, and some are moderate. Also what about avoidant leaning people? Avoiding a entire group of people is problematic and is not going to be entirely helpful. 

The answer shouldn't be we should avoid avoidants. It should be: 
Can they show up for me?
 Do our needs align?
 Are we compatible? 
Do I enjoy being with this person?
 Are they willing to meet me half way?
 Are they self aware and willing to do the work? 

I'm also not suggesting that we can't have our preferences, we also have the right not to date a group of people if we don't want to. 

3.) Avoidants don't ever date other avoidants. This is grouping an entire group of people into one box. People are incredibly complex, and avoidants can and do date and get into relationships with people of any attachment styles. It's too simple. Black and white thinking. 

4.) Avoidants are bad at reading your verbal and non verbal cues. Um, excuse me. People aren't mind readers, and it isn't the other person's responsibility to read your mind. It is YOUR responsibility to speak up about your needs and wants. Communication is key. 

5.) That secures hardly ever appear in the dating pool, if at all, and that they usually don't go through many partners before settling down. This one is a new one, but I felt I needed to discuss this. This is an assumption. Black and white thinking. People are incredibly complex, and secure's can date around before they find the right person to settle down with. Secure people also break up, get divorced, our their partner or spouse passes away. Secure attachers are simply more likely to work through the issues within their relationships before leaving, but they still have break ups and get divorced. 

6.) The whole ""just find a secure partner"" and ""you should be dating a secure partner because..."" Sure, having a secure partner will be helpful, however, if we aren't working on our attachment style and our healing journey, we can drag our secure partner into insecure attachment, and I will add again that it is our responsibility to heal our attachment trauma, and not place all of that onto our partner. It is not their responsibility, but them being supportive of your healing is a good thing. I feel the whole ""just find a secure partner"" thing is more of a band-aid approach, or as a crutch. We are responsible for our own healing. 

7.) Fearful Avoidants are rarely mentioned in this book, and they were lazy about describing them in my opinion, and they just lumped us all in with DA's. 

8.) That secure attachers are unconcerned about boundaries. The books stance on boundaries in this book I found to be harmful and problematic. Secure attachers most definitely are concerned about boundaries. They have great boundaries with themselves and others. They respect other's boundaries, and they expect other's to respect their boundaries as well. This made me feel like they promote enmeshment! Yikes! Secure attachers do not want enmeshment. Enmeshment is not healthy in any way. Boundaries are very important, both within our lives and in our relationships. 

9.) The viewpoint that our partners are responsible for our own well being. Relationships are interdependent and mutual, and both partners should be responsible for the well being of their relationship, but our partners should NOT be responsible for our OWN wellbeing. Our own well being is our responsibility. I do feel it is important to be there for our partners for events that are important to us, that they should be there when shit gets tough, like our family members dying or our pets dying for example. That's different than constantly using our partners as our emotional dumping grounds. 

10.) There is a more extreme portrayal of avoidants in this book, and I honestly feel that it is very damaging and harmful. It is black and white thinking, and paints an entire group of people in a terrible light. People are complex, and attachment is a spectrum. Not all Avoidants are alike. I also feel this book painted some of these avoidants as abusers, and attachment style (especially avoidant attachment) and abusers are two separate things. 

11.) It paints avoidants as abusers and anxious attachers as the victims. The Clay and Tom story and the Craig and Marsha examples are great examples of this point. Both scream abusive to me, and abuse and attachment are too separate things. Avoidants aren't abusers and any abuser can have an insecure attachment style. (They are co-occuring things.) 

The Pros: 

1.) I loved the protest behaviors, activation strategies, and deactivating strategies charts. I felt they were very accurate and through. 

2.) The advice to acknowledge our own needs accept them as normal. I love this advice because insecure attachers were often told our needs were invalid or too much, and we often are afraid of and don't know our own needs. 

3.) The advice that we should be authentic and use effective communication. I love this advice because we should always be ourselves and not hide who we are. Hiding ourselves is only more harmful in the long run. I also love effective communication and feel that is very helpful and that it should be used in our lives.

4.) The abundance philosophy and that we should be multi dating. I love this advice and I believe that it is healthy to date other people and multi date if we're not exclusive with the person we're seeing. I especially think this advice is really helpful for the anxious attachers because we tend to put our eggs all in one basket, to keep things simple. 

5.) The advice of giving secure attachers a chance. I do think it is important to expand our horizons, and date those with a secure attachment. (Though it is 100% okay to have preferences.) Being in a relationship with a secure can be incredibly healing, but it is just as important for us to remember that healing is our own responsibility, and we have to make sure that we don't place that responsibility onto our secure partner. 

6.) The advice about attachment stereotyping I thought was awesome and incredibly helpful! I think it is harmful to stereotype people in general, and I am glad this book mentioned that. 

7.) The relationship inventory excercise in this book was just amazing! I've used it a number of times, and I found it to be very useful and helpful. I love that this book included it and I found it to be very constructive. 

Final thoughts: I honestly feel this book is problematic and harmful and does more harm than good. I feel there are way better books on attachment out there, and I personally recommend other attachment theory books over this one. There are some good things in this book, but unfortunately the bad outshines the good things in this book. When I first read this book I legit thought I was a AP. It wasn't until I researched attachment theory and took a few attachment tests that I discovered that I was really a FA. 

My Rating for this book: 2 out of 5 stars. 2/5. If they ever rewrite this book and are more compassionate towards avoidants and also get a rid of the problematic narratives, I will rate this book higher, but until then, it will stay at 2 out of 5 stars for me. 

Read This, Not That! (My recommendations for Anxious attachers to read):

Read This: The Anxious Hearts Guide By Rikki Cloos

Why I recommend it: Rikki is so compassionate towards avoidants and even anxious attachers. She is like the best friend that will give you tough love, but she does this in a very helpful way. Her book actually gives helpful strategies on how to heal anxious attachment. I highly recommend it and love the book to pieces. 💖 This book has been quite helpful with my own healing. 

Not That: Attached By Amir Levine

Read This, Not That! (My recommendations for books on Attachment Theory):

Read These: 

1.) The Power Of Attachment By Diane Poole Heller

2.) Attachment Theory By Thais Gibson

3.) Hold Me Tight and Love Sense by Dr. Sue Johnson

Why I recommend these: All these books are compassionate towards avoidants and are also helpful towards healing your attachment style. There was also more books that I could of have added to this list, but I chose a few of these because this review is already long enough as it is lol.

670,Trouble with detaching after a breakup,"Me (AP) and my ex (FA/DA) broke up about 6 weeks ago after a relationship of just under a year. 

The relationship was a classic anxious-avoidant relationship - I put him on a pedestal, he held me at arms length. He was a lovely person and really tried but could not express his emotions and over the last month he started withdrawing from the relationship to the point where basically I think he wanted out but couldn’t bring himself to break up so I had to do it. I was so triggered and my self esteem was at rock bottom.

I instigated NC for 5 weeks and I was tearing myself apart. Then we spoke just before Christmas - I apologised for my behaviour towards the end of the relationship which I now recognise as protest behaviour. We had a nice conversation which I hoped would be closure for me but basically ended up me expressing that I wish we could make it work in the future and him not being remotely interested in that possibility.

Reading about attachment disorder has helped me so much - specifically reading about the triggers for AP was eye-opening. I can see, rationally, that that relationship and his emotional repression was the polar opposite to what I need in a relationship and triggered all of my anxieties - this in turn activated all of his avoidant characteristics. I know all of this rationally.

I finally feel hopeful finding Thais Gibson and wanting to really ‘do the work’ for myself, but what I’m really struggling is being able to detach from that relationship - despite knowing all of these things rationally, plus writing down all his faults I cannot stop putting him on a pedestal, thinking about how much I love him, miss him, wish the relationship would work and replaying every little thing that I could have maybe done differently to save the relationship. I also keep thinking about the possibility of him dating, of meeting a girl who truly makes him happy who he doesn’t hold at arms length, and it hurts so so much.
I then think that he probably isn’t giving me a second thought and I’m doing this to myself unnecessarily and causing myself so much pain. I constantly feel anxious, sad, and spend way too much of my life thinking of him despite trying to stay busy and distract myself.

I know that a lot of this is due to my attachment style but I am just finding it so hard to detach from him and stop hoping we will find each other in the future, because I know the relationship was not good for either of us.
The last time I had a relationship like this end it took me years to get over it. Conversely, I was in a relationship with a securely attached guy for five years and that was so easy to get over!

So I met a wonderful person a few months ago on Tinder and I started dating them. They made it clear early on that they very recently had become emotionally available to date and wanted to take things slow (only later I would realize that they were avoidant). Of course, my anxiety and insecurities made sure that that didn't happen and I ended up pushing them away and got dumped. It hurt me deeper than anything had for such a long time.


I was just reeling off of that and another old Tinder match of mine hit me up to ask if they wanted to hang out. I was more careful this time but when they told me they liked me the dumb part of my brain took over and I went back to my old self, daydreaming about what could be and anxiously making sure that it was heading that way.


Well, it didn't. Not because of either of us but lives just sometimes don't align. It still broke my heart tho, before it had begun to heal from the last time.


**What I've learned**


Tonight I realized that one of the reasons this keeps happening to me is how fervently I want to be with someone. I keep seeking out people to cohabit my life with me, in some strange hope that that'll give me the security I need to work on making it better. But that's too much to be putting on another human being. Relationships are supposed to be people coming together and making something larger and more beautiful than themselves. And I keep trying to find someone to make me whole.


So I'm taking a break from actively seeking out people to date. I've deleted all my dating accounts and uninstalled the apps. If I am to have any chance of having a secure relationship in my life, I need to be secure with myself. And I can't do that if I'm constantly thinking about how I don't wanna be single and looking out for ways to change it. I wanna make myself a person people are attracted to, rather than someone who attaches to anyone who'll let me.


If something is to happen, I need to have the resolve to let it happen organically. I'm hoping tonight is my first step to finding that resolve. Here's hoping I still feel this way tomorrow morning tho lol.",r1h9mk,45,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/r1h9mk/had_a_3am_epiphany_and_i_wanted_to_share/,AnxiousAttachment,1
672,The fallacy of ‘just find a secure person to date’.,"Often times I hear from different sources and/or people with insecure attachment styles that the best solution is to stop dating insecure people and date secure ones. 

While there is inherently pain in being attracted to and dating insecurely attached individuals who might make us feel unseen, unheard, not meet our needs, make us confused etc., there is a deeper purpose and reason why we are attracted to insecure people.

Firstly it is our subconscious attraction driving us towards the unavailable love because we might be too scared to receive love unconditionally. And so it is actually our nervous system being moved in a direction that feels familiar, rather than scary uncharted territory of ‘healthy unconditionally loving partners’. 

Secondly, it is our pain that is lingering within us, that gets highlighted and resurfaces the most, once we are face to face with a romantic counterpart. Suddenly they’re not just the person who is there in the present moment time. They’re the mom that never hugged us. They’re the father that always broke his promises. They’re the jealous sibling who competed for attention (if you’re wondering, those are all examples from my family). And suddenly, the stakes are so much higher than they would be if we were meeting a person just as they are.

But it’s not actually true, that a secure person would make all those projections disappear. The projections would be there regardless. Perhaps the pain can be intensified by partner’s insecure behaviour, but the insecure partner wouldn’t be Causing our pain, they would be triggering it. And so we would be putting an unfair expectation onto a secure individual, where we would act out our most insecure pain driven behaviour, and they would just have to take it, and be there no matter what.

One of the characteristics of a secure person is that they expect you to handle the relationship in a secure way. And if we are still processing our insecure attachment style, we’re not really ready to do that. We will act out in ways, that might and will rub the SA wrong, and they will set their boundaries.

I remember once I was in an attachment Facebook group, and the person there (a self admitted, commitment fearing DA) always referred to her partner as ‘my secure guy’. And I couldn’t help but feel like that a truly secure person, would dump her. Not because she’s a flawed human being, but because she wasn’t fully showing up in the relationship as an SA would. 

And so ‘just date secure people’ just won’t cut it. For many reasons.

What will cut it is falling in love with yourself. If you commit to loving yourself, no matter where you are in your life, who you’re with, or where you wanna be, you will eventually find that loving yourself will rewrite your subconscious mind, into more alignment with healthy love, and less entanglement with toxic patterning.

And suddenly you will one day wake up, and realize that youre in love with an SA. And their name, will be ‘I’. You will love yourself, and eventually you will love the secure person that you are. This can only translate into loving and being attracted to secure partners, who you’re now ready to meet with your own security.


Edit: Re-reading my post I wanna clarify something. When I said that the SA would dump the DA, it was because she was exhibiting manipulative behaviour. For anyone who’s SA, Manipulation should be a hard no-go. Should’ve been more clear, didn’t mean to insinuate that we have to be perfect to date a secure person.",pg53pn,45,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/pg53pn/the_fallacy_of_just_find_a_secure_person_to_date/,AnxiousAttachment,1
673,Waiting for texts when dating,"I struggle so much with my anxious attachment when dating, particularly when waiting for texts. I’ve gone on a couple dates with someone, and we’ve been texting a lot over the past 3 weeks. It has been over 24 hours since I heard from her though and I texted her a couple hours ago and she hasn’t responded. I’m so scared that she’s ghosting me or met someone else and my anxiety is OUT OF CONTROL. I’m having trouble breathing and I feel sick. This feels like one of the worst feelings in the world.

674,I finally did it,"I may still be an AA and learning, but one thing past experience has taught me is to not let things go for months without communicating in a calm manner what you want out of the relationship and your needs. 

Our society tells us that if you are a female and dating someone, you should be patient, not needy, not ask for exclusivity as these things drive men away. But as a female AA, I also have to respect my boundaries, my triggers, and do what is best for my mental and emotional health. I can't talk and date someone for months and not know where we stand and then look back and feel as though I wasted my time. 

I just told the DA I am seeing/talking to for few months, how I feel and that I need more and if he can't provide that, then it's cool and we should part ways. I'm sad as I suspect he will want to end it, but at least I won't continue this for another 6 months and get more attached.😔",o6rls7,45,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/o6rls7/i_finally_did_it/,AnxiousAttachment,1
675,You need to constantly remind yourself of the reality of the relationship.,"And write it down, friend! I posted this in another subreddit, but I think it's very related to an anxious attachment style to cling and feel as though you've lost an amazing thing after a breakup. My breakup was with an avoidant, so all the emptiness there was throughout the relationship was actually even amplified! Yet, I sometimes can only recall the good. It's so typical of the mind to have trouble processing this loss by only remembering the positive moments or words. But if I can be honest with myself, I can remember that the positive actions of my ex were few and that the words (if said at all) were rarely backed up. I think for the first few months, I was in so much pain I didn't write anything down.

But then I realized that by not facing the reality, I was in my own way trying to hold on to the relationship through the beauty I could remember. Then! I was using that bit of beauty I was clinging to in an overall one-sided relationship, to think about all the ways we could have made it work. But lol, the reality is that, we didn't make it work. And we couldn't make it work. And I did my part. But a relationship is only as strong as its commitment from both partners. I was being tortured, trying by myself.",nrd1at,45,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/nrd1at/you_need_to_constantly_remind_yourself_of_the/,AnxiousAttachment,1
676,Anyone else feels like ‘not seeing your partner when there is a possibility to see them’ is a huge trigger?,"I noticed I get triggered when I have a subconscious expectation to see my SO before a period where it will be impossible to see him. 
Example: he has a very busy week and the weekend before we are both free. I start panicking if I notice him being absent/needing time for himself on this weekend and time passes and the chances of seeing him before his busy week get smaller and smaller. My thought process goes like ‘this is the only time I can see him and now he is absent and I don’t know when I will see him again’. While he thinks ‘if it’s not now we will meet some other time in the future’.

Anyone feels the same? Any tips on how to change this? It’s not like I necessarily need him or need something from him, it’s just the not knowing when we can meet again and the idea that we are wasting time we could spend together that triggers me. I feel like this plays a big part in my self-sabotaging",mljqfm,45,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/mljqfm/anyone_else_feels_like_not_seeing_your_partner/,AnxiousAttachment,1
677,Let's go easy on ourselves you guys.,"I get it believe me; I made a post full of guilt and shame and self blame only a day or two ago on here. And there are so many that pop up here daily that it seems like very much an anxious trait, to self flagellate and punish ourselves so mercilessly after a misgiving.  

We've all made mistakes, we've all been through pain and suffering that has clouded our judgements and make us act out in ways not true to our real selves.  I just spoke with my therapist and she said that none of these mistakes should be taken upon yourself as a sign that you're crazy or messed up. We are all just human. In the midst of all we go through it is possible to miss a signal here and there regarding what the other person needs, but this is a learning experience and many of us are here learning for the first time. 

It's okay to admit to yourself, hey *this situation got the best of me.* If you reached the seeming point of no return with someone then the situation just got the best of you and that's okay. It does NOT mean that your efforts were in vain. It does not mean you didn't try as hard you possibly could.  The failing does NOT define you. It's the efforts to overcome that define you. It's all the times you didn't call, or reconsidered a text message, or talked yourself down from a nervous state, or tried a new emotional management technique, or read a self help book, or put your phone down and went for a walk during a tough moment.  

That's what you need to take a breath and finally give yourself credit for because it says so much more about you than the moment of weakness. It's the moments of weakness that lead to consequences so that's why we hyper focus on those. But the moments of growth are harder to see the results of until later down the line. 

And for god's sake, we just went through a global pandemic and are still in it. Give yourself a break. These are tough as hell times for people without all the turmoil of painful relationship conflicts and breakups. Think about that the next time you get down on yourself thinking, ""how the hell did I become this anxious 'crazy' person"". 

So what ways are you proud of yourself for overcoming?",mi3jr6,45,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/mi3jr6/lets_go_easy_on_ourselves_you_guys/,AnxiousAttachment,1

679,It is a long term battle,"I don't believe changing something as deep and as unintentional as being an anxious attacher is something that can be done overnight. I think it's a daily battle against fear and negative emotions. 

Today, I tried to stop looking for signs as much as possible. Although I ended up doing some of it, I managed to stop and convince myself that I trust my partner and that it's illogical and ridiculous to think, every couple of minutes, that she's cheating and that is only irrational fear in my head. I also faced my fear of abandonment, I reminded myself that breaking up with someone is a normal process that might occur if something is wrong in a relationship and that constantly looking for signs that something is wrong is only going to cause me trouble and anxiety and make miss out on the real relationship. Finally, I am writing this post to encourage myself to go on.

I wanted to share with you the progress that I believe I have made today. I wish it will be of help for someone else.

680,An ex reaching out,"My “avoidant” ex of one month has reached out to ask if I think one day, we can be friends.

I want to respond in kind as I know it took a lot for them to reach out, but I’m also not ready for “friendship”.   

I feel that the best response is to let them know that while I’m grateful that they took the step to put themselves out there, I’m not available for friendship at this time.  This is the right approach, ya?

681,Is it possible to have a secure FWB? Can you learn to be secure through causal dating?,"I know I’m not ready to seriously date. Not only have I realized I’m emotionally unavailable myself, but I’m going through some life changes and realize I don’t have the time or emotional energy to commit to and grow a serious relationship. It could also be that I haven’t met the right person after casually dating many people for a year and a half and feel burnt out and just can’t visualize it, but I don’t think I’m ready. 

Regardless, I enjoy sex a lot and prefer that I have some sort of connection to the men I’m sleeping with. So a FWB with no connection is out of the question. I have a high libido and feel touch starved when I go without sex/sleeping next to someone. A FWB in theory sounds great and I’ve tried so many but keep getting triggered when they get inconsistent or suddenly get closer then pullback. 

The person on the other side usually seems so cool and collected. Is it possible for us to ever just enjoy something like a FWB and not expect more? I see the advice all the time to just avoid them completely which doesn’t help. How CAN an anxiously attached person enjoy casual dating and sex? How do those of you who have earned secure and casually date approach such connections?",12ndbsy,46,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/12ndbsy/is_it_possible_to_have_a_secure_fwb_can_you_learn/,AnxiousAttachment,1
682,This has helped me with my anxious attachment,"I first want to send lots of love and compassion to anyone who is struggling with an anxious attachment style. Maybe this post can help others or at least let them know they are not alone.

I used to have an anxious attachment style in my relationships in the past. One of them was a long-distance relationship and the person was 6 hours ahead, which made it even harder for me cause they had a very busy job and social life on top of not being in the same time zone. At the time, my job wasn't that busy, and I didn't have much of a social life so I was really clingy and jealous. This person had literally become my world and every time the person would text I would text back right away. I also found myself putting up with some of this person's behaviors that I wouldn't put up with today cause I felt that if I didn't this person would leave me.

It took a breakup I had experienced a couple of years ago (it wasn't a LDR), for me to realize I had an anxious attachment style. I started reading up on it, and I also started developing some coping mechanisms over time.

One of them being having my own hobbies and interests that I can focus on. For example, during the pandemic, I picked up the hobby of drawing. And it's something I can spend hours on. So rather than ""waiting by the phone"" for someone to respond/call, I can draw if I want to.  My suggestion is to have an interest that you can really focus on so even if the person isn't responding when you maybe expect them to, you're really enjoying the time you're spending on something you love to do.

Another thing that has helped me is I no longer respond to people's texts right away (unless it's an emergency situation). If I'm out shopping or with friends, I'm focusing on that. I used to be too caught up in responding to someone's texts right away for fear of what they might think if I didn't respond right away. Even with friendships.

I also don't put anyone I'm in a relationship with on a ""pedestal"" anymore. My time and interests are also valuable, and I'm not ""waiting around"" till I hear from this person again. I was losing myself in relationships in the past, and I started working on loving myself.

Sorry for the long post, but maybe it can be of help to someone.

683,DAs do think about their ex,"I know a lot of people ask if DAs think about their exes or just shut them off, and why they don't reconcile. I suddenly remembered a conversation I had with my ex about his previous gf. They were together many years but he broke it off suddenly in a typical DA way because be wanted freedom.

He would talk about her quite often to me. He told me that he did miss her. (I'm mentioning this for all the does my ex miss me questions). 

When I asked the burning question of why he didn't contact or go back to her, he said this:

If I went back to her after breaking up with her because i wanted to be alone, it would make me the selfish and bad person. I'd only leave again.

He also had a firm belief that people don't change. So instead of stating his needs to someone and that person being able to adjust to him, he would just break up with the person and try to find someone that met his needs. He kind of expected people to be mind readers.

So that might offer some insight into why avoidants don't often contact their exes. I just thought I'd share this for the people that have had BUs recently.",11r4be3,45,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11r4be3/das_do_think_about_their_ex/,AnxiousAttachment,1
684,Advice: Real human connection is not forged over texting.,"So many posts are about the suffering we feel when we rely too much on texting and socials for validation and reassurance. It’s ok to text or social, but it’s far more important to have voice or in person communication. 

When you’ve met someone, or even while in a relationship, instead of pining and obsessing, make it your first priority to have a voice or in person visit scheduled. The topic of your texting should be focused on solidifying the date/time of your next phone or in person meetup. Don’t change the topic until that’s done.

After the first date/meetup, use a shared calendar like Google or Apple. Send an event invite, and ask for an acceptance. Pay close attention to whether they honor the agreed date/times.

Once you have a meetup or voice call on the calendar, accepted by both parties, stop obsessing over your texts or socials. Digital banter doesn’t matter as much after that. In fact, too much of it can be a way to avoid forging a real connection. It’s so tempting, but don’t fall for it. It’s not real. Get real. 

Once you have a calendar date, the rest is just fluff. Go enjoy your life so you can be happy, refreshed, and present when the date of your meetup arrives. 

You might work on a list of topics and “get to know you” questions to make your meetup more fun and interesting. Don’t blow your entire curiosity load over text. Save some curiosity for when you’re with them and can see their facial expressions. Investing in real human connection takes work, and can be a little scary, but it’s worth it in the end.

This is how adults date. By agreeing to meet and then honoring that agreement. Then rinse and repeat. Bonus points if you take a moment to plan your next meetup while you’re face-to-face.

If someone is not interested in dating (or relation-shipping) this way, as in confirming a date/time for your next activity, and showing up consistently (unless they have a very special reason to be an exception), they are not worth your time. Move on.",1129uze,48,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/1129uze/advice_real_human_connection_is_not_forged_over/,AnxiousAttachment,1
685,how to stop rage when i’m triggered/disappointed,"i’ve been avoiding intimacy for a couple months now since i’ve had so many negative experiences within the past 2 years and i’ve noticed that whenever i allow myself to be close to someone, especially in romantic/sexual settings and i feel abandoned somehow (they don’t reply for a couple of days, i feel an energy shift) i get this immense rage. it’s like i wanna unload on them and this just leads to me sabotaging the entire situation. i will literally tear down their character and find everything that’s wrong with them just to escape the negative feelings. this will all be in my head though, cause if someone leaves me on seen/read i have too much pride to text them again. the other person usually doesn’t know where it’s coming from cause i put up a front that i couldn’t care less. however, if that person disappoints me repeatedly i will hold it in until i explode. i don’t know if i do this to test them to see if they stick around or whether this is a way for me to cut off the situation cause i otherwise can’t. i usually experience this with people who make me feel very anxious and insecure.

686,I learned that I use sex as a coping mechanism to feel validated/worthy/loved...,"I started therapy last year, and it took me a long time before I finally sat down and looked deep inside myself and realized that I use sex for the wrong reasons. It's caused a lot of damage to me and others, and having an **anxious-attachment style** added into the equation doesn't help either.

perfect example: I had a FWB relationship for a few months with someone that turned into a genuine friendship. we hung out and talked all the time, but I was so upset and hurt that they no longer wanted to have a sexual relationship with me, it made me feel like I wasn't good enough or attractive enough. I feel selfish for even asking/wanting to keep the FWB situation going on, when they clearly don't. The sex and intimacy with that person made me feel comfortable and worthy/loved/validated, and now the thought of them having that with others and not me makes me feel like shit, and I feel lost. I keep having these thoughts of them sleeping with others and I ask myself ""why not me anymore?"" and ""what do they have that I don't?""

I understand these are my insecurities and a result of my upbringing and past traumas.

687,In defense of texting delays,"I don’t always respond quickly to texts. Not talking about days, but certainly hours, and even the next day. 

I am single. My priorities are friends, family and my work. I like the freedom to have a good time with the people I care about and not be chained to my phone. It’s one of the advantages of not having a partner or kids. When I am in a relationship, yeah, part of that deal for me is that I make it a priority to be reachable. But no, I’m not giving that level of attention and support to someone I have been on TWO DATES with. 

I’m not gonna interrupt my friend date or work focus to respond to a cat meme. I’ll send a cat meme back when I have a moment! It might be later that night. If I go out with friends late or I’m inspired to read a book, it might even be tomorrow! In winter I respond faster bc I’m usually inside. 

I would be put off and probably dump someone if they asked me in early dating for faster responses to meet their “needs” or quell their anxiety. I don’t want to be mental health support for a stranger. I am extremely available to people in my life for support. But if someone I just met wanted that, I’d wonder why- lack of friends? Codependency? I don’t rely n my app dates to meet my “needs” either- it’s a two way street. 

None of this is to say that I’m gonna date a person who always takes 3 days. I’m looking for clear interest. That can be responsiveness, planning nice dates, asking thoughtful questions- there’s many ways to show it aside from being chained to the phone. And if I don’t feel that clear interest, bye. 

I also want to give myself the chance to feel out how interested I am- Am I excited to hear from them and make plans? Or is it a burden? It’s fun to steadily increase communication with someone over a couple months that I like. Someone who tries to control this process with infinity texting ends up feeling more like homework than an interesting person I want to keep getting to know. I’m deciding if I like them and they are deciding if they like me. That’s the whole deal with dating. 

So yeah, I’m not even avoidant, I’m mostly secure, still kinda anxious sometimes and I still haaaate the idea that we should be pushing for faster responses from our dates.",103v1np,44,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/103v1np/in_defense_of_texting_delays/,AnxiousAttachment,1
688,Avoidant ex reached,"You can follow the whole story here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/wdtpxg/3_months_postbreakup_with_an_fearful_avoidant/


2 weeks ago, I was walking and I saw her motorcycle down the street. We live a few blocks away. A guy was driving it. I spoke to the guy and he told me that he was my ex's cousin. She sold him the scooter. That day I felt like complete shit. A lot of feelings came back to the surface. 

Anyway, at around 11PM, I got a call from an unknown number and it was her. She wanted to ""check on me"". A few things from that conversation:



- She wanted to end the relationship 3 or 4 months before, but then I did a few things right and she decided to continue it (what a great partner! /s)

- She's friend with all her exes. The type of relationships she has with them is that they speak about life from time to time (arm length). 

- She misses me a lot, cares about me but she does not love me (or whatever ""love"" means to her). She admires my drive. 

- She didn't reach out before because she didn't want to hurt me, but for some strange reason she went to a few places I usually go to (fucking weird).

- I told her that I deeply love her and she told me she feels horrible because she can't ""feel"" these feelings.

- Her life is a wreck. She wants to change job, get her green card (through the refugee program and move to NYC). Basically a trend in her life. She keeps moving and starting over again and again. No stability in her life.

- I was her first boyfriend in America, so she's kinda lost without me. She does not speak English. Like she got into a car accident and she wanted to call me.

-  She started crying because she told me that on a romantic level she's has some kind of blockage. She can't love. ""You're so lucky, at least you can love someone"". WTF

- She said she's alone at 33. No boyfriend. Nothing. Her 2 best friends left Miami and they moved in with their boyfriends. 


Now, when we talked about the relationship, she started mentioning things she didn't like about me. Things she never communicated. 

- She didn't like the fact that I was paying every time we went to get food. Apparently, that made her feel bad. She NEVER MENTIONED ONCE THIS. NEVER EVEN OFFERED TO PAY. 

- She didn't like the fact that I never gave her flowers (again, WTF. I was planning trip with her etc. She never mentioned it was important to her).

- ETC ETC ETC

I'm not going to go down that list, because it's fucking stupid.


How it ended:

- I told her to never contact me again. I'm not interested in being her ""support system"". She's not going to be the one dictating the terms of the relationship. It seems like she was confused by that. I was seriously getting frustrated by the fact that she's not able to compute that we will never talk again. 

- I told her I love her very much, but it's her loss. I have my life in order. I wanted to marry her and build a life with her. I'll give my time to someone else.

- I told her that at the end of the day, she never communicated ANY of her needs. When I tried asking her ""what's wrong baby?"". She was stonewalling me. Never opened up. 

- I told her that I'm dating someone now and I have ZERO anxiety.

691,my boyfriend is limiting how often he'll see me until I learn how to manage disappointment better,"When my boyfriend can't make it to something, bails, or changes his mind about plans -- I tend to lose my shit. All my therapy etc goes out the window and I revert to old patterns of sulking and protest behaviour. It's not as bad as it used to be, but it still causes him a lot of discomfort and anxiety. (I sound matter-of-fact here but I am deeply ashamed, upset, and just exhausted). He told me he is scared of disappointing me because of my reaction. 

His proposed solution: he has commited to seeing me every Thursday and Sunday, and nothing in between. That way my expectations are managed and he doesn't have to deal with my meltdowns if he can't make it to something. At first I HATED this proposal. Then I was more understanding that he needs to set boundaries to protect himself. And now I just feel ambivalent and constantly nauseous with anxiety.

692,Red flags to look for when you want a secure partner,"1. Chasing games, secures are direct with their interest in you, not hiding it behind insecure behaviour like breadcrumbing.
2. (At the start) Their interest in you isn't as mutual as your interest in them. If they are practically love-bombing you, it's a sign of repressed romanticism that's likely from avoidance. Equally if they don't seem interested either, you shouldn't feel this way with anyone, it doesn't matter if they're interested in their mind, secure people can express it.
3. Has a history of ghosting, cheating, or serial-dumping, these things tend to be patterns and that won't stop with you.
4. Doesn't have a strong history of long-term relationships that are meaningful. If someone can only seem to maintain superficial/ distant relationships, then there's a probably a reason why.
5. They take steps back when you're supposed to be getting closer. This is one pattern I have always noticed with avoidants after they honeymoon stage. ""Whoa!  we aren't that close!"" , ""Sorry, let's not do this anymore"" "" I don't feel like it"", if something is off the table (especially romantic ones) for no reason you're able to see, it's because their attachment trauma is now setting in. Secure people can do this, but it's less common as things are a gradual build-up, not a roller coaster with up and downs.",vz1up7,45,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vz1up7/red_flags_to_look_for_when_you_want_a_secure/,AnxiousAttachment,1
693,Texting and being AA,"I think I'm totally done with texting if and when I get in next relationship. I have seen a pattern that AA people take texting way too seriously in relationships compared to DA and secure counterparts. From observing myself and lot's of posts in this sub I have come to the conclusion that texting is number one cause of spiralling in AA people myself included. From not getting replies soon enough to not overanalyzing each and every punctuation mark I felt that my anxiety flares up too much when my primary mode of contact is texting. On top of it text messages can be wildly misunderstood and can be lost in translation way too easily. 

As I work on becoming more secure I have started to realise that texting maybe the most inefficient form of communication. It's just that there are too many variables not in our control when it comes to texting and my anxious self instinctively takes it personally. They could be busy working. Or they couldn't gather energy to reply. Or they simply forgot. I do all these things but somehow when I'm on receiving end of it I instantly become anxious.

So for that I have done following things, I have hidden my last seen and read notifications and I have turned off the display of messages in my notification bar. The only reason I'll text is to make plans or ask if they're available for a call. The other things I'll generally text are straightforward sentences which require no reply (example: can you bring chips while on your way here etc) . A meme once in a while. Nothing remotely related to emotions and feelings. Nothing that requires long drawn thought out response. Before texting anything I'll ask myself, can this be replied in one sentence ending the conversation or will it require several back and forth of texts, if it's latter then definitely something will be wildly miscommunicated in this back and forth so I'll quietly make a note of the topic and bring it up next time we meet or talk on call. 

If I have no other option except texting (this is only temporary since initially there's no other option if you met on a dating app) I'll do this, If I am texting someone I will purposely leave my phone in next room for long periods of time. If I send a text which I perceive risky I will immediately delete that conversation and switch off my wifi for an hour. This gives me time to calm my anxiety and not go to that conversation again to overanalyze. 


Bottom-line of this post is if you're anxious person avoid making texting as your primary mode of communication like plaque",uxhpgc,43,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/uxhpgc/texting_and_being_aa/,AnxiousAttachment,1

695,A relationship doesn't have to take up my life!,"Credit to the podcast 'The Anxious Love Coach', specifically episode 15 on 'Why your partner can't meet all your needs' for this realisation. I've thought about it before but I don't think it's clicked so well until I heard it put like this. 

In this podcast she mentions about the other 11 or so domains in your life that need attention from you to keep you fulfilled - e.g. Spirituality, learning, career, physical fitness. Relationships take up 1/12 of these domains. As such, the rest of the domains are in your control. If you're feeling unsatisfied in all these other areas, of course anything you get from your partner won't feel like enough. On the other hand, if you're meeting your other needs yourself, what you do receive will seem like plenty. Of course, we don't want a partner that has no desire to participate in the relationship or actively gets in the way of us meeting our needs. But for a healthy relationship in general, we can appreciate the small things much more. 

This really put things into perspective for me. I often neglect the rest of my life in a relationship and put all my attention on who I'm dating. So naturally I'm overly attuned to everything they do, and fixated on us staying together; otherwise I might be completely empty. 

This also made going forward feel more exciting and less scary for me. I'll be working on my own stuff either way; she'll either be there too, or she won't be. I'm excited to have a conversation with her that's from this perspective - what do we both want to do more of in life? And if we want to, how could we support each other to do those things?",sxvl5d,46,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/sxvl5d/a_relationship_doesnt_have_to_take_up_my_life/,AnxiousAttachment,1

699,My progress!!,"I just want to share my progress with everyone because I'm so happy 🥺🥺🥰🥰

Since puberty, I have had difficulty with having relationships. It can be romantic or friendly, I always had a problem. I’ve always chosen partners who are emotionally unavailable or manipulative. I believed that I'm unworthy of love. Until this year I didn't know the cause of this.

It's just that I have an anxious attachment style and abandonment fear due to my early relations with my parents. But I didn't understand that by myself. I had a panic attack due to my fear of abandonment and started getting therapy. I learned so much about myself and I'm healing so so much! I've never ever imagined I'll be happy with the person I am!! 

I have a relationship where I don't need to hide my anxiety or my insecurity. I can say no to things that I don't want; state what I want clearly, and don't settle for anything less. This doesn't always make me extremely happy at first maybe, but I know I'm doing the right and healthy thing for myself. These sound like little things but I've worked so hard to achieve this kind of comfort and it pays off!! I still don't have a secure attachment style but slowly I'll get there! It's worth it everyone!! Believe in yourself! You deserve to be loved by yourself!!

702,I (34 F) was blindsided by being dumped a week ago and yet now I’ve actually seen tangible evidence my attachment is healing.,"I suppose this post is part public self-reflection and anecdote to encourage you to keep working on healing your attachment style? 

I started dating a guy a couple of months ago. Matched on Hinge the day after my 34th birthday. Quickly hit it off in the app, with the texting, had a looooong unplanned phone chat before our first date, and then had hands down the best first date I’ve ever had. It was ~2.5 months of clicking and things feeling easy and good. 

We have the same “flavor” of childhood trauma and to talk about that with a person who gets it and has taken time to heal/process/do the work, man. It was nothing short of amazing to feel so seen. And not in a trauma bond way. This man let me show up (and I get credit for doing the showing up) as my whole self. He wasn’t weird about me having kids. He was seemingly understanding of the crappy ex and co-parenting—seemingly being the operative word there. I have worked so freaking hard to move past seeing myself as “too much” and this untrue that was fed to me for so much of my childhood and young adult life. And I saw that work and growth with being able to show up authentically as myself with this person. 

We have similar taste in music and interests and values that align. He has passions and talents and meaningful friendships and a full life. It was such a great example of finding a person who is complimentary and it just felt like a puzzle piece that fell into place. He is handsome and charming and leaned into my quirks like jokingly calling my epically longs texts “biblical texts” because writing is such an huge part of how I communicate. It just felt so right. It was easy. 

Evidently, it wasn’t right. I did just get blind sided by him calling it off, but he was transparent about his wants and needs and desires and concerns about falling to patterns of codependency. And when I was hit with sudden change of heart, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t immediately go to “oh my god it’s me. I’m too much!” But you know what? Within 36 hours I’d let myself feel those feels, I honored the wounds that it comes from, and the childhood pieces that it brought to the surface. And it still sucks. It’s sad and crappy and painful. There have been a lot of tears. But I found myself able to see where this person is at, offer to dive in to the scary parts and unknown and navigate it together as our adult, wise selves and I took his answers and let it be. Does it hurt to be told no, I don’t want to try this? Abso-fucking-lutely. But for the first time in adult life I’m able to hold two truths and once and know it’ll be okay. It’s true that what we had and the connection was real and good and amazing AND it is also true that he cannot offer me what I need and deserve. 

Somehow this man managed to break my heart but still also helped me really believe the things I’ve know but was struggling to embody. Things like knowing that I am enough. That I’m smart and passionate and caring and beautiful. That my body is beautiful. Things I just couldn’t come to feel fully. So did I literally go from thinking “oh my god I might be falling in love with this man” to having it all called off in a period of a day, and this one isn’t going to stop hurting for a while, but I also know truly and deeply that I’ll be okay. 

There was one piece, one wall, that I was on the crux of pulling down. And I didn’t, and I’m relieved I didn’t so I know there is still work to be done. In news they will not shock most, I’m an anxious person. It’s in my nature. And often my anxiety is this wave of big feelings and then being hit with physical manifestations. When it happens, I want so badly to just let the walls and mask down and exist and let someone hold space for me.  And like literally hold me. I am still so bad at this because my exhusband and my mom really did a number of me with their shaming of when I show up like that. There were a couple moments where I almost felt like I could remove those barriers. He came to a memorial with me, it was for a high school student of mine who died and I was so worried and anxious about going. I lowered some of the barriers. But not all of them. I am so good at masking my anxiety when those waves hit. I may have the racing thoughts and blurry brain and lack of focus, I might feel hot and sweaty, and know my heart is beating fast. I’ll manage the physical urge to fidget or distance myself physically so any trembling isn’t noticeable. And I don’t want to have to hide that and hold it alone, but that’s the one thing I really struggle with. I almost let that wall down, and I wonder if I had, what would have happened? 

I’m sad. I feel heartbroken. I kind of want to be mad because it feels like it would be easier to be angry. My closest friends are on my behalf. My best friend jokes that she won’t learn the name of men I date until they clear 3 dates and prove they might stick around. He did and changed from being called {name of unique sport he coaches} guy to his real name and still she said “I knew it. I shouldn’t have bothered to learn his name.” Ouch. I’m sad and relieved she didn’t get the chance to meet him. I still think he is wonderful. Which is hard. 

The worst case scenario happened. I was willing to go all in and he called it off. But I’m mostly okay and I know I’ll be fully okay soon enough and that really proves to me that the years of therapy and introspection and work are worth it. 

I can now say I have personal experience that can stand as evidence of the work I’ve done to repair my anxious attachment style is paying off. The problem is the shitty way I figured it out. As it turns out, being dumped out of nowhere will really give you a crash course in feelings the feels and seeing the changes in attachment.",12a57nl,45,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/12a57nl/i_34_f_was_blindsided_by_being_dumped_a_week_ago/,AnxiousAttachment,1
703,Great video: Why AAs fall for love-bombing; Why AAs ruminate endlessly after a discard,"I've started watching Heidi Priebe's videos (thank you u/hiya-manson !) and honestly, they should be official study material for this sub. This is the first one I watched and I already love this lady.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5EIUFsQ758](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5EIUFsQ758)

It's about how the different attachment styles deal with the lovebombing - devalue - discard cycle of a narcissistic relationship (which mirrors very closely the lovebombing - deactivation cycle often described on this sub, so the same dynamic applies).

I really recognise my past anxious self in the description of how an AA reacts, down to the reasons behind it. And I really recognise myself now in how a secure reacts.

Dropping some tidbits from the transcript below, and honestly, everyone go watch it now because it's great.

Transcript bits:

**Lovebombing:**

""when you get someone who is let's say anxiously attached there is this negative view of self positive view of others. and I think that those on the anxious attachment Spectrum are most susceptible to believing what someone with narcissistic patterning is telling them during this love bombing phase because those with anxious attachment strategies tend to self-regulate through fantasy quite a bit. 

So they will frequently have this kind of fantasy world they go into where someone is going to come along and be the answer to all of their pain and all of the struggle they've had in life and that person is going to see them and understand them perfectly they are going to think that they are the best thing that has ever happened to them and they are going to put all of this targeted attention and praise directly on them. it is the fantasy of finally being seen and chosen by someone who they view to be hyper worthy. 

And so when I hear the kind of love bombing phase being discussed what always comes to mind for me is wow that must be the anxiously attached persons absolute answer to their dreams because there's this fantasy that they use to self-regulate and now that fantasy is being represented externally, right? So it might feel like oh my God it's finally happening and that's probably gonna feel like this incredible high.""

**After the discard / deactivation:**

""those with more anxious patterning I imagine are the ones who get really caught up in trying to learn everything about narcissism, getting obsessed about watching video after video after video about why did my narcissistic partner do this. because that is what happens when we have a preoccupied Style. We believe that the answer to the way we're feeling internally lies out there somewhere in the world and if we can only find it and if we can only Crack the Code then the way we feel inside will change. however this is not how it works unfortunately. 

The way you feel is the way you feel and spending time fixating and ruminating and obsessing over every little thing your narcissistic partner did that made you feel bad and maybe ruminating on it with other people online it only keeps you stuck in that relationship you're still having that relationship in your head when you're doing that, right? it's almost like you're trying to find the solution or crack the code that will allow you to unfeel the pain but there is no unfeeling pain. if you have pain in you it needs to get processed, it needs to be metabolized, and only then will you be able to truly move on.

but I think that this is a really big area where a lot of people who Veer more anxious on the attachment Spectrum get really stuck it's almost like if they can prove to themselves that this other person was incapable of loving or this other person was the one who was actually wrong or bad or evil or corrupt then they can tell themselves, well the problem isn't me right? I must be worthy and lovable but the reason they treated me that badly was because they were evil and wrong and bad. 

and this is not entivalueless like there is definitely a time and a place for understanding what other people are struggling with and for understanding that not everything about the way people treat us is personal. however this is just a way to stay stuck in the drama triangle forever: if you're turning your ex-partner into the persecutor in your head so that you can stay in the victim position.""",10rs0e5,41,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10rs0e5/great_video_why_aas_fall_for_lovebombing_why_aas/,AnxiousAttachment,1

I'm honestly getting so fed up with this behaviour. He has time for his buddies, watches movies with them, hangs out with them but when it comes to me, I can't even get him to be consistent about his texting. He answers at most 4 times in a day, 5 hrs apart.

Nice guy, but for this and some other reasons, I get the impression he’s pretty avoidant. 

I don’t think this is a bad thing as I’m pretty sure I don’t want to date an unhealed/unaware avoidant again, but that’s MOST single men in their late 30s or 40s on the apps. I mean I guess it’s good I’m not really wasting time or getting hurt bc I figure it out early.

I thought we could start a thread where people share their advices, resources, tips, or anything that helps! 
I don't know about you, but as an anxious person I struggle trusting my own gut and intuition. My anxious mind usually takes me to different scenarios, I end spiraling and sometimes the anxious thoughts cloud the reality. 
Here's a list of things I do to clear my mind and anxiety: 
- I pace, walk, run or ride my bike. 
- If I feel an 'anxiety attack' is building up, I take a cold shower, or lay on the ground (cold surface). 
- All the notifications on my phone are turned off, except for calls, and 3 close person. 
- I have a piece of rope, or elastic with me to play with. 
- I journal, I put all my thoughts in paper, even if they are disorganized, I just take them out of my brain.

713,I just started dating a girl with anxious attachment style. how can I help her feel safe," 

So, I just started dating this girl around 3 weeks back. She is pretty cool and likeable. Anyways yesterday I came back to my hometown for a family function. She had asked me to inform her after I reached, as it was a late night flight and I would be reaching home around 11pm. I said ok. When I reached home my whole family was up waiting for me and in this excitement I forgot to message her. I was up till around 1:30 am talking to them and then went to sleep. I didnt check my phone before going to sleep as I was so tired. When I got up in the morning and checked my phone I saw that I had 16 missed calls and a bunch of panicked messages from her asking where are you, please message me once, are you angry at me etc. I was naturally concerned and immediately facetimed her, and asked her what happened and why did she call me 16 times and left so many messages? Is everything ok? She was on the verge of tears by now and just kept looking at me. After around 5 minutes she again asked me ""are you angry""? I said no, just concerned.

Then she finally told me that when I didnt message her after reaching home she got extremely concerned about me, that either I had gotten into an accident or I was purposefully avoiding her. Here I laughed a little (my bad really) and again she got teary eyed. But I said sorry for not messaging her and told her why I was not able to message. It was then she shared with me that she has an anxious attachment style, and although she is in therapy for it, sometimes she gets irrationally worried that her partner is either bored of her or is trying to push her away and she panics. She also said that her ex used to shame her for messaging him or asking him to keep her in the loop and call her needy and clingy. Thats why she was on the verge of tears when I called because she was convinced that I was either going to fight with her or break up with her. Anyways she had to go to work so she hung up and I promised her that I will message her during the day at random intervals to keep in touch. She appreciated it.

Anyways, my question is this Reddit- what else can I do to make her feel safe. I dont mind texting but what else can I do? She is in therapy so she is trying on her end, but how I can help from my end? I would especially like to hear from people having anxious attachment style and their partners about how they manage to keep the insecurity at bay?

716,Working on my anxious attachment makes me feel avoidant.,"Hello, long time lurker here!

I have an anxious attachment style. I took the quiz a few months ago and have been actively working on it since then. I've been doing a lot of work on myself to heal my attachment style and become more secure. However, I now feel like I am becoming am avoidant.

Suddenly, the closeness I once craved for scares me a little. Not that I'm against it. I still want it. But not as much as I used to. Because of this, my desire to always be with my boyfriend (who is DA) is less. I still love and want him, but I am becoming more and more comfortable with my own space. The idea of being with him as often as I wanted to makes me feel a little frightened to be honest. Sometimes I find myself wanting to be alone even when we are together.

I am also noticing that my feelings towards the future have changed too. If you had asked me a few months ago what I wanted, I would have told you that all I wanted with him was marriage and children. But now, I'm not even sure if I even want to move in together, let alone have a family with him. I'm more sensitive to his flaws and less tolerant to his mood swings.

Is this normal? I heard that when people become secure, they tend to feel as if they are avoidant when in reality they are just more secure.",mpzm16,43,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/mpzm16/working_on_my_anxious_attachment_makes_me_feel/,AnxiousAttachment,1
717,I'm so thankful for this community,"Exactly as the title states. At the beginning of the year I had my situationship ended. I was pretty heartbroken over it and also found myself getting mad at myself. I found AT at the beginning of our conversations and it helped me to know how to handle protest behaviors and not lash out.

When it ended I found this group and made a post about tips to be more self compassionate. Some said daily affirmations. Some recommended books. Some just confirmed that I'm not alone in my feelings and shared their experiences. I did daily affirmations for a month. I loved doing it. I did get the audiobook of what was suggested. I haven't listened to it yet. But because I've felt more secure I think my emotions can now handle the book. 

I love that I found this community and r/attachment_theory. Commenting on people's posts and reading shared and differing experiences has been extremely therapeutic and helpful for me. Therapy has been helpful. This last month I've felt more myself and secure and healed.

I am happy I found you guys and I love sharing any experiences or thoughts where I can. You're all amazing and beautiful souls who are just doing the best you can. Let go of some of the shame you hold and direct it towards inner healing. If you're struggling, come here to your friends.

But I’ve noticed after we hangout and he goes home I feel so empty and alone. He’s totally fine with not talking to me for hours while I crave the attention. Just being in a call with him makes me feel at ease. We don’t even have to be talking. I really hate how I feel so needy and clingy. I try really hard not to show it. Is there a way for me to work on this? I want to feel happy I got to spend time with him, rather than thinking the time is up.

720,Surviving the Avoidant/Anxious breakup.,"Well it sucks to be back here, but I'm sure as hell glad to have this group. Started dating a girl in the end of November and we just broke up last week. When we started dating I thought that I was entering into a relationship with more secure attachment, and believe it or not it was for me! (Small victory.) However, despite my initial belief that she was secure I learned just a little about her past and began to recognize her avoidant behaviors. 2.5 months into the relationship one of her parents passed away and everything changed, 3 weeks after that I told her that I loved her and wanted to make sure she was okay and that I was there for her if she needed anything. She didnt say the I love you back, as expected but I told her before I said it that I wasnt expecting to hear it back. A few weeks after that (a la last week) she told me she felt that she felt herself pushing me away...and let me tell you, it was true because for over a month I felt her withdrawing and not reciprocating any of the feelings in the relationship. I did what I could in terms of supporting her and offering her my support, but every time I offered to help she would insist that she could handle things herself and despite my desire to help coming from a place of love I felt that she resented me for it. When she mentioned about not continuing a romantic relationship, I was almost relieved that I was going to be free of feeling that emotional separation but disappointed that after a great 2.5 months and another 1.5 months of trying my best to support her it all ended with her just throwing away our relationship. 

Yeah I cried a couple times this week, and that feeling of emptiness has crept up on me a few times (what made me think to write this post) but overall I feel oddly more secure. I feel more secure about my own attachment and comfortable with knowing a little bit more about my own needs. I might not be able to fulfill all of my own needs emotionally but I'm more aware. Dating an avoidant, especially during a very turbulent point in their life, has made me feel more aware. Even in sadness there is comfort in knowing that there have been lessons learned. I thought about pursuing this and staking a case for continuing the relationship, but I know that I personally do not want to be with someone who will cut me out of their life/heart/mind/whatever when there is something wrong. 

I just needed to share this with fellow anxious attached to personally vent and to also let you all know that working on yourself really does work...eventually you learn to handle the emotions and the crises with more poise, confidence, and love for yourself. I'm here for all of you if you're going through the same.

Thank you all for sharing your stories and advice -- I went through a rough time last year, and having all of the support here was critical to my healing process. If you're going through it, the people here will absolutely help you out. 

I realize that in addition to a break from dating (I've been doing this since the Fall), I need to take a break from digging into my attachment style/analyzing my past relationships/etc. A big part of focusing on myself is focusing on what I have to offer the world outside of romantic relationships, and as long as I'm actively focusing on studying attachment style, it's not something I can do fully. This also applies to reading about relationships, watching TikToks about them, etc. - I'm going to walk away for a while. 

There is more to life than romantic love, and it's something I've had to learn the hard way. I'm looking forward to investing in my other hobbies and interests (I sewed a skirt this past weekend!) and not focusing so much on finding a partner. 

This isn't goodbye forever and if anyone ever needs someone to talk to, please feel free to DM me.

723,DA ex returns,"Hello my friends. I'm reaching out to update y'all-especially those who I've developed friendships with in this community. I would love encouragement. I write this with a very sad heart, despite knowing I'm doing the right thing. Thank you for reading. Sending all of you such big love as we continue to navigate our attachments.

This year has been a fucking ride. I've been posting about the dissolution of most recent serious relationship with my DA ex since he (he/they) broke up with me in April of last year.

&#x200B;

To summarize, it was fucking devastating. They left the day after losing their job, saying they needed to be alone and find themself. It was apparent that they weren't sure what they wanted. I lovingly, securely let go and supported their decision and went no contact. I grieved and processed. After slowly gaining my bearings, I began working on myself. 10 months after that break up, I can say that I am becoming the best version of myself and have drastically changed my life. I moved out of state to a new city, I learned about attachment theory and am focused on becoming securely attached (I lean anxious, and even disorganized when deeply triggered-though I am still not reactive.) I've been in a 12 step recovery program since July and in therapy for over a year and overall, have been really developing my boundaries, confronting myself and making changes that for a long time I wasn't sure were possible.

&#x200B;

My ex texted me on my birthday, 3 days after I moved out of state. I didn't immediately respond-I took the time to consult with my therapist, my friends, my friends in recovery. I journaled, I sat with myself and really took the time to determine what it was that I wanted and was available for. I ultimately decided that I wanted to talk. We made plans to have lunch when I would next be in town-about a month from that point. In that month I am coping ahead and centering my life. I'm getting established in this new city, building a safe home for myself, creating outlets (getting a gym membership, looking for a creative community to plug into).

&#x200B;

We meet for lunch, and it turns into an entire day together. We look at each other the same way we always have, and it's so apparent that there's so much love that's still there. He brings up the breakup and wants to talk about it and I let him know I wasn't ready yet. That I needed time to establish trust, and to feel safe. I needed time to emotionally prepare for that conversation. He respected that and apologized for how abrupt his leaving was. There were SO many indirect indicators that felt like he wanted to get back together. At one point, it felt like he was directly insinuating that he would move to the city I'm in. He was remorseful in bringing up weddings he had attended that we were supposed to go to together. Overall, he seemed regretful. He held me, held my hand, kissed my forehead, told me he loved me and of course, there was a lot of sexual tension between us that I noticed.

&#x200B;

I didn't hear from him for about a week afterwards, and begin to notice my old relationship anxiety coming up again. I'm grateful that I've spent so much time creating peace for myself that I could spot it right away. He texted me, letting me know he's thinking about me and has been talking about me to his friends. I notice I'm anxious in our conversation-not knowing when we will talk again or see each other again. I send him something the day after that's directly communicating where I'm at emotionally, what I want, what my boundaries are, and what I'm comfortable with. He seems to respond to this really well, and it feels like we are on the same page. We get on the phone, and I bring up the sexual tension between us, and let him know that sex is off the table right now. I think he might've interpreted my boundary as rejection, because he began to backtrack from there. He said three things that really upset me- 1. that he didn't put a lot of thought into reaching out to me again. 2. he wants to be friends. 3. (the biggest kicker) he doesn't know what he wants. (SCREAMS.)

He asks to reconnect in a week. I am in a white hot rage as soon as we get off the phone-really hurt by the continuing inconsistency between his actions and his words. He texts me maybe 3 days later, letting me know that his intention in reaching out is to be my friend and stay in contact. I respond and say, thank you for letting me know. I'm not available for that. If you'd like to talk about why, I can offer that information if you'd find that helpful, otherwise I wish you well. He said, ok, thanks for letting me know, I wish you well too. And that was that.

I'm really proud of holding to my boundaries, but fuck is it so hard. I still want things to work out with this person so badly. I still want this person in my life, truly. And I know at this point, I cannot authentically offer him friendship. It's not what I want. If I agreed to that, I would be pouring into him to influence/manipulate the outcome that I'm wanting. With the inconsistent behavior/words on his end, I don't trust that he wants a friendship either. I am not available to be used to make him feel good about himself when he's not doing the work on himself to build his own self esteem. (The only way I can spot this is because I've done the work to spot this in myself.) Any way I slice it-it's just an ""absolutely not."" I don't want to resent this person, OR betray myself (arguably much more important.) The bottom line is that, that offer is not in line with the integrity I'm wanting to live with, and I can't accept it. One of my friends in recovery told me that the only way they've been able to let go of their ex is because they still believe it can be better between them. It's been a really comforting thought as I struggle with my desire to control the outcome, and my embarrassment over still loving and wanting someone who's lack of self awareness continues to hurt me.

I've been noticing that I'm really fixated on whether or not this person comes back, and we can have some kind of relationship-romantic or otherwise in the future. I'm embarassed to share that I've been watching SO much tarot tik tok and allowing myself to be comforted by the idea that this person will realize their mistake and come back, even though I have no control over their journey. I know that letting go is actually the kindest, most loving outcome-allowing this person to continue to go and figure it out for themself, and still loving them from a distance where I cannot immediately be hurt by their actions (which isn't to say that I'm not hurt right now-I really am.) I'm holding to these relational boundaries that I've set, but energetically I'm having a very hard time surrendering to the unknown. I have started to grieve again, though this grief is 'cleaner' in a sense. It's not the pain of self-betrayal and self-abandonment. It's still a loss, but it's a loss that I chose out of self protection-which is something I've NEVER been able to do before. My friends, friends in recovery, therapist, family-everyone is proud of me. I'm proud of me. And I'm struggling.

I'm not really typing this to ask for confirmation that this person will come back-although of course I want to hear that LOL (sad cries.) I'm reflecting on this journey to secure, the tests involved (ALL OF THIS FEELS LIKE SUCH A TEST), and REALLY sitting in my loneliness and sadness and dealing with it. Learning how to care for it, and not using other people to distract me from it. Yesterday I almost googled ""How do I let the universe unfold and do its thing?"" No one ever modeled to me how to feel my feelings, and it's an awkward process that at times makes me feel embarrassed, or like a failure-to be 32 and learning how to do what feels like the most basic, healthy human functions. I'm trying my best.

I still love my ex. So fucking much. I feel like I can see all the way down to their inner child, and I'm not sure they've ever been so clearly seen by another person before-which is why they run and return. Letting them go is so hard, and is a new measure of my capacity to love people. I have not always been able to release, and honor it. To be able to let them go and figure it out, and still love myself enough to stay out of the way of some of their self-destructive behavior (not a judgment-I am referring to addiction, etc.)

724,The struggles of dating while being secure,"Being secure in yourself should be the goal of any insecure attachment, especially for AP but it's not necessarily how we picture it. We don't suddenly find the best partners in the world, instead we just grow healthy boundaries and filter out the trash until we find something different.

As a secure, when you realize that emotional unavailability, immaturity and other red flags should be avoided ASAP, you begin to feel really lonely. You can talk to 30 people in a month and most of them will probably go nowhere with no real reason besides your security boring them away. Insecures date eachother, move in real fast, have babies, get married, say ilys like crazy, breakup and date 2 weeks later, of course this isn't really healthy since insecure relationships are usually plagued with issues, but as a secure the dating pool's size drops significantly once you rule these people out.

Also, you just don't get the same excitement and innocence from relationships, your self esteem and stability greatly diminishes the value of validation from others, getting reassurance from an avoidant is intoxicating due to intermittent reinforcement but if you're getting that validation from yourself all the time, you don't feel much. Relationships also take a back seat in your life, they're nice and are an ideal goal to strive for, but they're likely to not be your #1 goal anymore and you'll probably enjoy doing things that are more stable. As I'd like to say the dfference between climbing mount Everest and finding prince charming is that mount Everest won't ghost you half way during your climb for reasons outside your control.

I'm a rock when it comes to relationships, I'm always there and willing to talk it out, but when there are no issues about yourself the only problem is the other person. It's really obvious that relationship problems is ""their issue"" thing at this stage because I could be doing things right step-by-step while I get ghosted for 3 weeks just to be told ""idk ur too alright sry"".  It's exhausting being the pillar where you have to constantly set boundaries, keep yourself firm and stay patient, when you're still recovering it can be tempting to double-text people and go AP mode on people when you aren't getting no responses, but in truth, doing so changes nothing, so it's best to move on and find someone who responds without needing you to chase them.

Being secure is always worth it, the upsides greatly outweigh the bad, but I think it's good to vent about it and notify healers that it's a slow, warm, calm trip at the end.",ygn9mx,42,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ygn9mx/the_struggles_of_dating_while_being_secure/,AnxiousAttachment,1
725,Experiencing pain at the hands of an FA/DA is the single most difficult thing I’ve ever experienced.,"Nothing has ever derailed my life like the silence from an FA or DA partner/friend. I know my downfall as an AA. I’m very aware and have been in therapy for this for a long time. 

It never gets easier, it actually feels worse every time. My first relationship was with a full blown narcissist who disappeared after saying I love you, never to be heard from again. 

My second “situationship” of 6 months with a guy I grew up with ended the same way. After making plans to visit me… disappeared and blocked me on everything. It left me a shell of a human being with a major trauma response. I loved him. I ended up becoming depressed for months. Lost 30 pounds in 2-3 months. That’s a lot on someone who is 5”2. 

I have been in therapy for both of those situations, it’s been enlightening and terrifying.

This past two years I took a break from dating to work on me, my art, my career, my friends, etc. I had been feeling so peaceful and most importantly, confident in myself as a trying hard human with insightful vision and a heart of “almost gold”.

Then I meet this guy on my recreational sport team. A year later I gave him my number. This was 2 months ago. We went on dates and it was so fun and cute and we developed a connection I have never felt with another human being. 

And guess what, he’s fucking taken me down the same fucking path as the others. I let my guard down, and he does a 180 on me. Asked me to be friends and has been silent on me for over a week.

I’ve already blocked where I can and stopped reaching out. I know what I need to do so I’m not looking for advice. I just want to vent to people who understand the pain.

I have barely eaten in two - three weeks. My heart and my body physically hurt. I’ve bawled my eyes out more times than I can count. I HATE being an AA. I wish I could know what it’s like to compartmentalize feelings. 

I know what this trauma response can do to me if I let it get out of hand. I am doing everything in my power to lift myself up and not let that happen. 

But my god you guys, I know you know, this shit is excruciatingly painful and I can’t stop thinking about how this person hates me, even though it’s clearly not about me (I’m fucking awesome btw). 

I just wanted to vent. Being empathetic is truly a blessing and a curse. I believe we experience the love others are too afraid to have, but we also experience the absolute lowest of lows and pain imaginable.

That’s all. Like I said, no advice, I’m self aware and know my problems and the steps I need to take. I just have to vent to people who understand because no one in my life gets it.",xopy5q,41,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/xopy5q/experiencing_pain_at_the_hands_of_an_fada_is_the/,AnxiousAttachment,1
726,It can be so difficult as an insecure attachment to separate your worth from someone's actions,"Two months ago I made the decision to break up with my (AA leaning secure) partner (DA). Of course, this has been deeply triggering to some of my unhealed wounds.

I left the relationship because after several attempts at communication regarding putting effort into finding more quality time for one another, with full agreement on his part, there was no follow through for nearly a month. I allowed plenty of understanding and grace during the time as I knew there were a few external stressors going on at the time which looking back now was causing a slow but painful deactivation. I ended the relationship because I ended up finding out that he had felt that I was asking him to change. I've done a lot of work on myself to work through what is left of my AA triggers and wounds, but of course, it all doesn't just go away in one day.

Deep down I still want some massive, unrealistic sign that my decision was overall objectively justified even if it isn't what he or I wanted. (I completely understand how much of an anxious place this comes from, I hope my vulnerability doesn't come off as oblivious but rather as trying to embrace and admit what I need to heal.)

The night we broke it off, neither of us wanted it to end and he kept repeating how he did not want me to go. He also acknowledged that he hadn't handled it all correctly and that it was his fault. I didn't know how to tell him it wasn't about ""faults"" but rather something much deeper, at the time even I didn't know what that deeper truly meant but I could see and feel it towards the end of our time. I tried to keep the conversation as neutral and to the point as possible, but eventually, before we finally parted he began saying things such as ""I'm not going to let this be the last time I see you"" and ""I'll do better for you."" I finally said only one statement regarding any mention of a future between us and replied ""I want it to be us too, I just can't keep having a hard goodbye at the end of it."" I only said this because this was our second attempt after two years. He'd come back with telling me he'd left the relationship abruptly and ghosted me the first time because he was scared and immature, he wished it hadn't taken so long but he was always looking for a reason to justify his decision and realized he didn't have one.

To get to my main point, he finished it off by telling me that the time we see each other there won't be a goodbye at the end. Everything he said before parting had so much volition and I was afraid that that's what would happen, and I knew it would make it extra difficult to accept that despite anything he might say, I may never hear from him again if he shuts down the way he did the first time. It is not that I expected to hear from him, but having him say such strong promises despite knowing how he handles difficult events created that dissonance I wanted to keep at bay and keep the conversation focused on why it just wasn't working right now. I want to mention that he also said he wanted to hear from me again, whether it was a text or anything. I let him know I didn't think that was appropriate for me.

However, after discovering AT and talking to some trusted close ones, I realized where my leftover AA wounds had shown up here and there in our relationship. I was able to see where I definitely could have acted more securely at points. I decided to reach out a few days later to see if he'd be willing to speak since I knew he said that was something he was comfortable with. My hope was that I could bring up AT and my own wounds, and more importantly, apologize, but I kept my expectations low. I never received a response. I knew this was the most likely possibility, but it didn't hurt any less. Again, after more careful discussion with loved ones about whether it would be appropriate, I decided that after a few weeks I'd send him at least a text apology acknowledging where I could have done better while still maintaining my boundaries regarding what I'd initially left the relationship about. Regardless, I kept it focused on accountability to avoid triggering any wounds of criticism. After a month of no response, I decided it was best for my sanity to remove him from any social media, where I was obviously able to become more triggered seeing things he had already removed such as a playlist he'd made for me, etc.

I've had a hard time balancing how caring and committed he had been during the relationship, but also reminding myself my needs were not being met anymore and I had done as much as I could to meet him halfway. Remembering everything he said that night and then accepting his disappearing/ghosting afterward has caused a lot of difficult turmoil and triggering.

I hope this post made sense, I'm in therapy and actively working on myself, and don't want this to seem as though I have only spent all my time focused on the other person's suspected attachment style, etc. I only wrote this to see if there was anybody who had been through something similar and how they guided themselves through separating their wounds and worth from somebody else's actions.",xo8bv3,41,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/xo8bv3/it_can_be_so_difficult_as_an_insecure_attachment/,AnxiousAttachment,1
727,Every weekend I want to break up with my boyfriend when his busy or not responding.,"I find myself wanting to break up with my boyfriend all the time if he doesn’t reply to me in time or if he “ forgets “ to message me good night. I start feeling so much resentment towards him and start bringing up old issues from the past. I demand things from him and I just spam him with messages sometimes really hurtful and mean things: I can’t help it ! I feel like my intuition is telling me something about him like his not good but then I’m confused. 

Even after iv addressed the situation and told him I like it when he messages me good night he just says it’s one message and he will message me in the morning cause sometimes he forgets, but then continues to do the same thing. 

When I’m having these episodes I feel so betrayed and angry that I want to block him out of my life and never speak to him again. I start feeling sick and I can’t concentrate on anything else and my mind is racing.

728,Is this typical of an avoidant?,"I’m 4 weeks post break up. I’ve taken the break up extremely hard as was blindsided by it. I’d consider myself a secure bordering anxious attached type. I am beginning to think that I was in love with an avoidant which triggered my anxiety but grateful for some clarity. 

Our relationship wasn’t without faults, no one is perfect and the distance between us didn’t help although I was willing to compromise. He struggled to make plans and always resorted to last minute which did make me anxious. We did however share the same values and ideals in many other areas of life, we had the same sense of humour, type of future we wanted and love for adventure, food and same music taste.  We talked everyday without fail and he’d initiate good morning/good night messages. 
In person I felt like we were unstoppable together. I love psychical touch and so did he. He’d embrace me and let me embrace him, hold my hand in public, we’d constantly hug and kiss each other, stare into each other eyes lovingly, he’d look at me when I wasn’t paying attention then I’d catch his eye and he’d give off the biggest cheesiest grin, when he’d see me approaching him he’d grin too and give me the best hug, we could have eye sex (iykyk), we could find each other’s eyes in group settings always looking out for one another, given our distance when spending time together we’d never leave the person alone unless we had to, we’d never get bored of each others presence. Even if we sat in silence or just watching tv he always wanted me close. He was like this up until the break up. We didn’t have a big fight but I initiated a collaborative chat about the fact that whenever I ask to see him it ends up in conflict, it was bugging me in our relationship and we hadn’t addressed it head on. I got especially upset as I was planning to introduce my brother to him for the first time. It was after this he decided to dump me. 

On the day he broke up with me he was cold, calculated, blunt and couldn’t look me in my eyes. He looked past me and to the left as if I was a piece of trash and wasn’t worth engaging with. He then demanded a hug at the end of our conversation (post dumping) and got offended when I didn’t agree to one. I couldn’t, I was devastated. I thought we could make it with such a solid basis. 

How could someone go from being so loving and affectionate to cold and emotionless? 
Was all the above affection a facade?

730,just realized how much of my attachment issues is actually ego problems,"Just want to preface that I'm talking about me specifically, not all APs or AP leaning FAs act like how I do.

But I just noticed how egotistical I can be. Sometimes I won't care about someone until they start moving on from me. Then suddenly I get this weird feeling like ""uhm, excuse me. Your supposed to only want me. How dare you like someone else?"" even when I don't actually like them.

I noticed how a lot of my relationships are power based. Sometimes I want the power so I won't let myself be 100% vulnerable with others while letting them spill their own beans about their insecurities (I never use their insecurities against them though. I just don't want anyone else having something on me if that makes sense)

Sometimes I wonder if my fear of being abandoned or cheated on is actually just based on my ego. That I don't actually fear them leaving, I fear having an outside source confirm the horrible things I think about myself. That im unworthy, unlovable, defective, and that everyone else is a better option than me. 

When people leave me I actually get over them scarily fast and I stop caring (it takes 1 to 3 months for me to get over someone. Sometimes weeks depending on who it is) . Which tells me I didn't care about them as much as I thought I did. I cared about what they *thought of me*. Them walking away from me and rejecting me is stepping on my pride.

And that's typically when deactivate. If a relationship is too imbalanced where I feel the other is ""winning"" and has all the power, I feel like my dignity is being stepped and they have the power to destroy my ego. So I temporarily cling and then leave and never come back. 

This is kinda why I feel for the guy who ghosted me recently. Something he said about his exes resonated with me. He told me it was satisfying giving them a dry reply and leaving them on read. He didn't want them knowing how much power they had over him. He said he gave them nothing. No love, no hate. Just indifference. Then he said it was the first time he was able to have that much emotional control and that he felt like he could do that to me too if he needed to. Annnnd he did lol.

It hurt but I get where he's coming from because I'm like that too. I hate feeling like I'm at the mercy of other people and never knowing when the other shoe will drop. I don't like anyone having that much power and influence over me. So if I feel afraid, I'll destroy everything and run so no one can take my power from me. What little of it that I have. I hope this is making sense, I'm really bad at putting my words together lol.

But realizing this just reminds me how important it is to be self aware and try my best to make these changes. Not just so I don't have to suffer anymore, but so I don't drag anyone else I to my whirlwind of chaos too.",u4cwzv,40,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/u4cwzv/just_realized_how_much_of_my_attachment_issues_is/,AnxiousAttachment,1

732,Dealing with someone who's aware of their issues but does nothing about it is much worse than dealing with someone who's unaware,"This isn't to hate on anyone for having attachment problems. I truly do get it from all perspectives. It's so easy to fall in maladaptive behaviors when you're just trying to feel safe (whether this means needing closeness or distance)

But now to my point. Dealing with someone who is aware they have issues but does nothing to deal It is much worse than someone who's unaware. At least when they're unaware you sort of have that closure knowing they're not likely to change and that just don't know what they're doing. You definitely know it's not your fault. 

It's a special pain when they know just how bad they're hurting you, but they would rather risk losing you to keep their maladaptive coping mechanism than try to do the work it would take to have a healthy relationship. It hurts knowing you have to leave behind the potential precious bond you could've had with them because they just won't try.

It hurts knowing that your partner is going to continue suffering themselves until they get help. And it especially hurts when losing you was the catalyst it took to get them to change and then you watch as *the next person they date gets the healthy version of them you wanted all along*.

This can trigger awful feelings and thoughts like ""why was I not good enough?"", ""what made them so special that my ex finally changed?"". It just hurts. This post is more of a rant of me mourning the fact the guy I love just isn't going to change. I just have to accept that reality. The patterns are going to keep repeating until we both make those changes.

Sticking with him while I'm trying to heal is just going to hold me back and make me fall back into old bad behaviors myself 😭",txowu3,44,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/txowu3/dealing_with_someone_whos_aware_of_their_issues/,AnxiousAttachment,1
733,I think our DAs just aren’t that into us.,"i’ve been knee deep in attachment theory research for +8 months, and having gone through an AP-DA cycle that ended poorly, and researching mental health and personality disorders, and the psychology of mate selection in humans and all the “dating advice” that people have been giving out for years and i’ve come to a point of merging it all together and……….

i actually think they just don’t like us the exact same way you, my dear AP reader, also lose interest in someone who’s too into you or whatever other reason.

from an emotional perspective there is no difference between deactivating as a DA, devaluing as a narcissist, and just losing interest as a normal average person.

it’s all the same thing. they just dont like you enough to care anymore. they cared before, when you gave them “butterflies” in the beginning, but that wears off with time, and now they’re not into it, and you smothering them makes it worse (it would with anyone).

i realized this because i do it to other boys. i was crazy about my DA. but other people? meh… and from an attachment theory perspective they would probably label me DA which i’m not. i’m just not that into them.  but i keep them on the back burner so i dont feel lonely, i like the validation while i figure myself out and look for someone else that is a better fit for me. 

and you guys have done it too probably without realizing it. most of us have friend zoned or led someone on. or thought we liked someone and got to know them more and got turned off. 

thats it.

there is no secret sauce. no “they love me they are just are too traumatized to realize it”. if they wanted to, they would. because they did before. thats how they got you hooked in the first place. they just dont really care.

go read the posts in the avoidant subs and it becomes even more obvious.

countless posts of “ugh.. am i deactivating or should i end it? i find my partner intolerable”

like….. they dont actually like us.

and with that, i think its time i conclude my AT journey. after months of reading posts about APs pining and yearning for DAs that treat them so horrendously i think i’m finally over it. you really want your DA to love you? stop trying to figure them out. stop caring. match their energy and meet indifference with indifference. makes you a lot hotter. thats why you like your DA after all. its human nature. we value strong people who are unshakable and unbothered. we like to chase a bit.",thnddm,42,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/thnddm/i_think_our_das_just_arent_that_into_us/,AnxiousAttachment,1

735,Two more things that have helped my journey towards secure(r) attachment,"Hey so I did a post like this about a week ago and thought i'd hit you with a couple more ideas!

*Just to caveat as I got some pushback on my last post: This isn't 'how secure people behave' this is 'how I am trying to mitigate my anxious attachment and move towards secure'. I feel like a lot of people are like 'go to therapy' / 'work on yourself' - like yah sure, i'm sure we're ALL DOING THAT, but it's not a quick fix and you might need other advice in the interim. Also I've been in therapy and working on myself for over 3 years soooo i think it's kind of BS to suggest that people don't date at all in that length of time until they are 'fixed'.*

On to the tips!

**1) Recognise that your avoidant ex or object of affection was complicit in the dynamic that you had.**

You know the phrase 'it takes two to tango'? Too often I find anxious people thinking they have 'created' a scenario in their head out of being crazy or delusional. This is reinforced back to us by current dating narratives of 'if a person isn't jumping through fire by the second date, they just aren't into you!'

There are very few people I've met who are truly so socially unaware that they have formed a completely one sided attachment. Usually, whether it's a crush on a friend which has got out of hand or a relationship where AP feels like they 'made it more serious than it was' when a DA gaslights them, there's a reason that it has got to that point.

You aren't delusional. The other person helped to create the connection. They are now, for whatever reason, trying to rewrite history to pretend like they had no part in it. (See the series Shrill season 3 episode 4 for a really great example of this!)

**2) Over-anticipate your emotional investment in something, even if you're not quite there yet.**

A misunderstanding of anxious attachment which I see a lot is that AP's are OBSESSED right from the get go and are planning a life together after one date. In my experience, this isn't true, and AP's often fall into the trap of appearing to be guarded, believing themselves to be aloof / uninterested and then 'catching feelings' for someone in a FWB / situationship.

How many times I've heard : ""It's fine, we're just going to hook up! I don't even like them like that!"" from friends, only to encounter a sobbing mess a few weeks later being like ""WHY DON'T THEY LIKE ME?!?!""

I always assume I will catch feelings right from the start, even if I haven't got feelings for that person YET. That way you are laying the foundation for a relationship where you are not left feeling the anxiety of unmet needs e.g. dating as well as hooking up, or if you are \*adamant\* this person isn't right for a relationship anticipating your needs and making them clear up front. A big one for me was the concept of 'casual' e.g. clarifying up front what casual means to the other person and what you want out of a 'casual situation'. When I say casual, I mean a regular & consistent situation, which is non-romantic. When someone else says casual, they may mean 'I'll hit you up every 3 months and we'll have a grand date but then i'll ghost you in between'.

Get on the same page, and be planning for the fact that you'll probably catch feelings.",p0dprz,41,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/p0dprz/two_more_things_that_have_helped_my_journey/,AnxiousAttachment,1
736,Sometimes I feel like the only response is to laugh,"We come on here to try to understand ourselves and the avoidants that we love, only to be told that trying so hard is part of what drives them away. I can see that to a degree. But we aren't the only ones present? It's an issue to us too that we're the ones trying.

Even when avoidants ""care"", they do so on their own terms. How is it that we're being simultaneously asked to make allowances for their behaviour and not take it personally when they don't make any allowances for ours?

Or, if we make too many allowances and assume they care more than they show (because, surprise, they're impossible to read) it's on us for assuming that, and we're hurting ourselves.

One thing that has been really bugging me as well is the dishonesty. They say it's good boundaries that makes them drop people, but it's actually far from it. It's so extremely immature to bail because the other person is ""too much"". 

What about saying, ""I'm overwhelmed, I'll return to this convo when I'm ready""? I have //never// heard this from a DA, instead I was supposed to just ~know~ that they were overwhelmed, and not only understand, but shut off my own needs as if they're a tap. 

It would be good boundaries if they stayed away, too, but if you leave the door the slightest bit open they come right back again...

Those words get thrown around like nothing, but it is nothing short of painful for an anxiously attached person. God knows how we want to talk things out right away, and now you're saying to talk tomorrow?

Do you even know how long tomorrow is for me? I can already imagine how tough tonight will be to get through. How sleepless I'll be, how I'll keep thinking of you every minute. The journey of disconnection that I'm being forced through, but I really don't want to go through.

I want to get angry, I want to lash out. You want to talk to me tomorrow? I don't even want to talk to you tomorrow! I won't talk to you until you understand how I felt.

But even I know ""punishing"" you, is more of a punishment for me. I'm the one that will suffer more, and the one that will be desperate to hold you.

739,Finding balance with AA and making a decision to leave..,"I’ve been posting here over the past few months and have gained a lot of strength from this sub, so thank you. 

I 31f was dating a 37m for a few months since early December. It wound up being a lot more complex and I self reflected a lot on my AA, more so than ever. 

I wanted to post here to share my experience and how I’m feeling today after I broke up with him last night for not meeting my needs. 

He was absolutely wonderful and it’s definitely painful, but ultimately after 3 months of dating I decided that if he wasn’t going to say “hell yes” about something long term with me, it was disturbing my inner peace and not worth it. 

We had a crazy chemistry, I really felt like I was falling in love. The way he held me, cared for me, he really treated me well. However. We discussed exclusivity twice throughout the relationship to which he said he had a lot of things he wanted to do before getting serious with someone. At first, I thought it was still early in our relationship and wanted to see what would unfold. But ultimately since that initial conversation about 1.5 months in, I grew increasingly anxious about where it was going to lead. 

We spent an amazing valentines together, but I couldn’t help in the back of my mind wondering if it’ll lead to a relationship. So I gave myself the past week to look at how when I wasn’t in this situation how much more stable I felt. And ultimately decided to tell him he can’t lead me on anymore.

He wanted to remain friends. I said no, and that I’d be blocking him from social media. 

This isn’t easy by any means, but I hope to my fellow AA’s that you do recognize when enough is enough for you and make a decision that suits your mental health.  Learn the difference between your non negotiables, your negotiables and your needs in a relationship.

743,1 year post-breakup with an FA. What I learned,"This is going to be a long post. 

You can follow the story here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/zoz0wp/avoidant_ex_reached/

- How am I doing now?

I want to start by saying that it still hurt sometimes and I still miss her. The main emotion I feel nowadays is anger. Anger because I feel like I was gaslighted at the end. I come to realize that I was indeed in a relationship with someone emotionally unavailable. I've accepted the fact that I was more invested in the relationship than she was. She always had a foot at the door. She always was ready to flee at any signs of conflicts. I'm also angry at myself because ultimately, I feel like I should have seen the signs. I should have listened to my gut feeling. 

I'm feeling better overall and the raw pain is gone. 


- How did my attachment style changed after that experience?

It is unfortunate, but I'm more avoidant now. I actually feel like I'm moving to the FA territory. Whenever I start talking to a woman, I get super anxious. At any moment, I feel like she's going to ghost and stop liking me. I'm very anxious at the beginning. Then, when she reciprocate the feelings, I start feeling avoidant. I'm so afraid of being the one being hurt and to feel the pain again. 

However, sometimes I do feel secure. That happens when I'm cultivating a relationship with myself. For example, when I focus on going to the gym, I plan trips or I paint. It's weird. I can feel it inside of me. The anxiety disappear and I feel normal. 

I think I'm getting closer to being secure, but I know it's going to take some time.

- How's dating for me now?

It's been difficult. Like I mentioned, I feel more avoidant. I have a harder time attaching. However, my anxiety sometimes kicks in especially when I overanalyze text messages. Example: she texted me that she wants to see me and we have a date planned for Saturday. I'm afraid that she will lose interest if I text her before the date or her feelings will change if I ask her how was her day. 

Because I'm aware of my anxious tendencies, I'm now extremely afraid of appearing ""thirsty"".

On a positive note, I've made great progress in communicating my needs. I'm more direct and I tell the person what's important to me. 

- Did she ever reached out again?

No she did not. I blocked her from everything and I told her that I never want to talk to her again. I don't snoop on her social, I'm not interested in reaching out. 

- What did I do to get over her?

The only thing that worked for me is reading about attachment theory and time. I hooked up with multiple women, I had flings here and there. It didn't make me feel better. Actually, quite the opposite. 


- What I've learned from this experience?

Frankly, I've learned that I should not stay in a relationship if the other person does not meet my needs. Furthermore, I've also realized that communication is extremely important. You want to be with someone who's mature enough to problem solve and communicate. That is also applicable to friendships.",1274ys5,39,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/1274ys5/1_year_postbreakup_with_an_fa_what_i_learned/,AnxiousAttachment,1
744,ABANDONMENT ISSUES ARE SO REAL.,"hi guys, I wrote a little while ago about my partner blindsided ghosting me, God I was so so so miserable i can't even tell. I used to cry my eyes out, wake up till 3 am and even have had a low-grade fever because of stress. Eventually, I decided to send a breakup text and got a response from them, leading to a conversation where they explained that we had different values and that they ""couldn't keep doing this"". We ended up breaking up, but it has actually been peaceful since then. I can function my daily life. I can enjoy other things in my life. I am actually so shocked to see how different I feel now after breaking up versus how I felt before. It's interesting how gaining clarity and perspective can bring ease to a situation.

I realized that my fear wasn't necessarily rejection which is also why I can keep reaching out to people.   My fear rather was of being abandoned by someone I love. When my partner ghosted me, it activated this subconscious fear.  But a breakup doesn't activate me. ( If you're no longer a loved one you can't abandon me. Is it something like that LOL? ). Some people with attachment issues like mine may equate rejection with abandonment. Some mourn the loss of relationship and that's why it is hard but since we only dated for a short time, I'm able to move on relatively easily. 

In conclusion, I've learned that a perceived abandonment from a loved one is more painful for me than an actual rejection. It's fascinating to see how the attachment issues can affect us and how REAL these issues are.",126b2rm,40,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/126b2rm/abandonment_issues_are_so_real/,AnxiousAttachment,1
745,Ruminating and coping skills,"Free advice from my therapist today I’d like to share with you:

Have you ever found yourself ruminating over an emotion, memory, or an unresolved issue? I tend to do it with my avoidant ex, imagining telling him how he has hurt me or sad memories, but I can’t stop thinking about it. Ruminating is like torturing  yourself everyday and can make you very depressed or anxious. Going through this with a memory or feeling one or twice is okay, but if you keep having the same thoughts over and over with no solution, you could find yourself in a state of rumination which can be harmful to your mental health. She suggested these coping mechanisms: 

Ruminating may have to do with unresolved trauma or worry. Our brain’s emotional centers may be over firing and exhausting it’s self. It’s kind of like a CD with a scratch on it, and just skipping and repeating the harmful feelings over and over. Your brain is trying to find a solution. To deactivate the firing, she suggested using other parts of our brain to find a solution. 

First she stated it’s always helpful to journal everything out, even if it’s writing a letter to the person or event that will never be seen. Write out everything you’d want to say and feel then put the journal away or burn the letter. 

She stated that sometimes it’s helpful to look at the person and ask, “ if this person or feeling was a color or shape, what would they be and how would I change it? What does that change symbolize.?This triggers the creative parts of our brains to look at the situation differently. 

She stated that doing a math problem or restating things you learned in middle school was helpful as well ( like naming all the countries or presidents) . This triggers another part of the brain. This is very helpful if there is no solution to the problem you are having because it gives the brain a similar satisfactory feel. 

Doing activities that triggers both left and right side of your brain are also helpful. This could be going on a walk and using your left and right feet, Playing a piano and using your left and right hands, tapping on your shoulders with your hands across your chest, And even moving your eyes to the left and right can be helpful. It helps engage other parts of your brain to activate and work. 

It’s also very helpful to ground yourself. Pick up a leaf and look at the intricate details of it, smell it, and feel it. Describe everything about. This is also really helpful with a piece of candy. Take 15 minutes just being mindful with something and breath. 

If you have an anxious or avoidant attachment style it’s extremely important to go to therapy. I’ve been in EMDR trauma therapy for two years and have learned so much about my anxious attachment style and what triggers it. You don’t deserve to have to relive with this feeling over and over. You have the power to heal and ground yourself in the present moment and be who you want to be. 

Good luck and happy coping!",1257i1f,41,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/1257i1f/ruminating_and_coping_skills/,AnxiousAttachment,1
746,Did the DA ever love you? Did it mean anything?,"Hmmm..after all the info I've gathered through contemplation, research, and first hand experience..they are EXTREMELY insecure and fear abandonment. 

They want to get close, but once someone gets too close, it triggers them and they run or close down.

Basically, they abandon before they get abandoned. It is an EXTREME defense mechanism. I assume it stems from trauma. These people operate on EXTREMES.

I have no doubt that at one point they were attached. Even had feelings and hope for the relationship...but they don't have the capacity to hold on or put in the necessary work to make it last.

They literally 'don't know how to.'

They may still feel attached but they won't show it because they've learned to self soothe and hide behind their armor and walls for soo long.

 They've come to believe that everyone will leave or hurt them so they need to be hyperindependent. Hence why they won't share their emotions outwardly.

After the honeymoon phase ends, the mask falls and the facade fades, you are literally seeing their true self.

They are afraid, they are insecure and in a lot of pain. They can't keep up with the front. So you are left seeing the cold, emotionless, deactivated side of them...

I'm sure they came from abusive/traumatic upbringing so they don't know what a healthy relationship looks like nor do they know how to maintain it. They also don't have the tools or skillset to do what's required because they probably ...again, don't know what a healthy relationship looks like.

What we perceive as a 'lack of effort"" on their part, is them literally trying their best. 

My DA literally told me ' I have feelings for you, but I don't know how to express them properly.' That was him being vulnerable.

I wish I could give their inner child a huge hug. These people need love. They're human. They want connection, but they literally don't know how or it's difficult for them to let it in for prolonged periods of time...hence the push pull dynamic...or the stonewalling, distancing, and cold demeanor after the honeymoon phase.

Ever heard the saying ""hurt people, hurt people?""

These people are in an EXTREME amount of pain. What you see in the beginning of the relationship is a facade. Theyre trying their best to match you so they can fulfill the hope of finally finding and feeling a love that they lacked all their lives.

 They're in survival mode and are trying to preserve themselves. That's why they have  again...EXTREME trust issues.


I really hoped to be the person to throw the lifeline and I was hoping they'd grab it...but that's the thing with hope..it keeps you stuck in mind loops and it's an endless cycle of hurt.

When I last left my DA, I asked him to at least walk me to my car and give me one last hug. He was stone at that point, but he did reluctantly walk me out.

I asked for a hug, and for a rare moment, he let his guard down and  gave me a real hug... I told him...'im sorry if I did anything to hurt you. I don't want to let you go.'

He stood there watching me till the very end...as I got in my car, started it up, and drove away.

They're not good at expressing love in a way that 'we want' them to...but in that moment, as I drove away...I know there was love...in him, in me...

There were no words, but i certainly felt it.
I don't know if I'll see him or hear from him again, but I can't force him to do what 'I want him' to do. The way I see it, we mutually released each other of the pain.

I wish him the best. No regrets, no remorse, no resentment. Only love and healing. I've also assured him that I'm not going anywhere, I want him in my life, the door is still open. 

Whether he decides to walk through that door, I'll never know...but I don't want to add pressure to his pain and I will let him decide when he's ready.

Until then, I have to learn to let go.
When a relationship brings more pain than it does peace, I think the best thing you can do is release. Release each other. The love obviously always remains, but I have to 
Let him live his life..and I will live mine too.",11ob0pn,42,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11ob0pn/did_the_da_ever_love_you_did_it_mean_anything/,AnxiousAttachment,1
747,I think this is what hurts anxious attachers the most,"Sunken cost fallacy. ""What on earth is that?"", you might ask. Here's a definition from Google that explains it better than I can:

""the phenomenon whereby a person is reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action because they have invested heavily in it, even when it is clear that abandonment would be more beneficial"". 

I think underestimating our own value and then *over investing* in other people is our biggest mistake that always ends in a train wreck. 

There have been times where I completely threw my dignity and what little pride I had away chasing someone because I already wasted a lot of time and energy on them. I thought ""what else do I have to lose?"". A lot, you have a lot to lose. 

Every time I continued to chase someone my self esteem tanked into an abyss and made my depression much worse than I could ever imagine. 

Take that energy and reinvest it into yourself. The more you advocate for your own needs, desires, and standards, the better you'll not only feel about yourself, but other people too. 

When you filter out bad people, you open the doors for better people to come into your life. I'm pretty sure I'm pessimistic and biased towards most humans because I've put up with a lot of shitty folks that I should've left (and being honest with myself, *I knew they were bad. But I stayed anyway because I thought I could change them*) 

That's another thing, I noticed people will say ""you attract what you are"". No, you *accept what you think you deserve*. If you think you don't deserve love, affection, time or attention (even though you want it), you're going to accept people that affirm that unconscious belief. 

The problem isn't that you're wearing a sign on your forehead that says ""abuse me"", the problem is you're overlooking red flags or you just don't see them because of past traumas that made you think the red flags were normal (which in this case it's not your fault, I'm not blaming you. Once you see those signs it is very important to learn from them and apply them as soon as you can so you're not victimized again.

Some people are very sneaky so it won't always work and it's not your fault).",10zo0ir,41,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/10zo0ir/i_think_this_is_what_hurts_anxious_attachers_the/,AnxiousAttachment,1
748,I can't handle being left on read and I get depressed and I can't move on my daily routine because I ruminate,"I get depressed if I can't talk the person in real life after that.

I really hate it because it shows how much you ""friends"" or your romantic interest don't care about you. You don't have any value. They never think about you. You're always people pleasing everybody but nobody cares about you.

Even when I get angry in real life or over text I suppress this emotion and pretend to be sorry or to be nice. If you get mad to the people they won't ever talk to you or be your friend. I hope I won't affect my mental health in the long run which is already really bad.

They're usually on their phone all day when you see them in real life but when it comes to answer you they don't care.

751,Anxious and Avoidant - How are we making things work out – sharing strategies and solutions,"This is the story of Me - anxious attachment F29 - and my boyfriend - M34 avoidant attachment. How are we making things work out – share strategies and solutions. 

I feel like my input can be interesting for anyone who is trying this type of relationship because I’ve learned a lot so here it goes. 

I will present specific examples and exercises for couples.   
 

Warning: very long post

 Context:  
 \- Together for 2 years  
 \- I’ve been doing constant and intense therapy for exactly one year (started nov 2021)  
 \- We had a massive argument a few days ago and I decided to ask for a real break  
 \- We live together but he is going to move out today at least until Christmas (he booked an Airbnb to give us some time and space)  
 \- He is starting therapy in the next couple of days  
 

Reasons:  
 \- I believe we are soulmates, I’ve had a few relationships in the past, I have an extremely active social life and I’ve met a lot of people in my life while travelling. I’ve never met someone that fits into “all my boxes”  like him.

 \- If we actually want to be together forever, this ""little"" break will mean nothing in the long-run and at the same time might be our salvation for the future. 

 How we got awareness:  
 \- I’ve always knew that I was extremely insecure. I’ve realized I had severe abandonment issues a year ago, and I came across the attachment theory maybe around 9 months ago. I quickly realised that I am Anxious Att, and he is Avoidant.   
 \- I shared this with him and he immediately agreed. He said it made a lot of sense in his head. He has always been extremely insightful about himself.   
 \- We always knew that our relationship was extremely challenging and abusive in many ways, so when we discovered the attachment theory it all made a lot more sense.   
 

Our favourite resource:   
 https://www.instagram.com/thesecurerelationship/  
 

My actions:  

 \- Therapy once a week, then eventually twice a week and now once a month, but Im looking to change it to twice a month soon

 \- I kept a list of “happy things” - because I never felt loved or I didn’t trust that he loved me, I started to write down everything he did that made me feel loved (from my own perspective). It helped me a lot to focus on these happy things.  
 \- I started to microdose on mushrooms around 6 weeks ago, because I feel much more secure but I also still feel anxiety so I decided to pursue some external but natural help.  
 \- I'm reading the book ""Insecure in Love"" and I'm sharing the best pages/relatable moments with my boyfriend, is really good and he enjoys to read it with me sometimes. 

Our actions as a couple:

\- me and my boyfriend have safe words for different moments. 

Example:

We have a word for:  

  ""pause the argument""  
 ""you are not listening to me""  
 ""I am feeling a lot of anxiety""  
 ""I cannot stay in this place anymore (during social or family events)"" – this means: we have to leave immediately but we can only use this word if we had used the word for anxiety before. 

This is to help you, first, manage your anxiety before feeling the need to leave immediately. It prevents it from being an escapism.   

And the last one introduced recently: ""i need to feel special "" (this one is my favourite because i came up with this word but in reality he uses it more than me, which makes me feel extremely validated). 

They are random words like: “butter” (so that no one understands around us) we came up and they work extremely well for us. 

Our only rule is that the other person has to respect the value of the world immediately. If it's to pause the argument, we pause immediately no questions asked.   
 

2years ago, around the beginning of our relationship, I literally couldnt stay in any social interaction/moment without us having a huge argument. 

The reasons could be: 

Anything from looking at a girls purse and giving a compliment, or going to the bathroom and on the way stopping to speak to people and ""forgetting that I am waiting for him"", anything was a trigger for abandonment for me. 

The pressure I used to put in this relationship was insane. 

\- One of the key factors of my recovery was understanding not only anxious attachment style but avoidant attachment style. The more you understand the avoidant partner the more you understand that it's not about you. 

Example: my boyfriend has a huge tendency to ""go for a walk"" in the middle of an argument. 

When I deeply realized how he needed to avoid conflict, i stopped thinking: he doesn't love me, he is abandoning me. 

I used to go crazy, stop him from going and say stuff like: if you leave its over.

and I started to let him go for the walks without escalating and preventing him from leaving, the result was: 

he would go for his walk, 20min at first, and come back and apologize and understand everything and we would have a constructive conversation.  
 now, he goes for a 2min walk, sometimes doesn’t even leave the house. We just pause and adjust our conversation.   
 

\- We do mushrooms together (small doses every 3 weeks) to relief the pressure of the relantionship, it gives an overall sense of love, nothing bad will happen, we love each other a lot.  
 

\- We go out separately. We both have a very active social life, we love to hang out with friends not only during the weekend but also during the week. This one is very helpful for me in particular because I was to co-dependent.  
 Example: I used to love to solo travel, but once I am in a relantionship I cannot do it. For my birthday he booked me a flight for a place I had never been too, and we met me there 4 days after.  
 So I got to solo travel for 4 days bymyself, and he came to meet me there afterwards.  
 

I cannot think of anything else right now, but I can keep updating the post if anyone is interested.  
I would like to know your strategies and inputs on this.



Edit1 - I would like to add that this post doesn't mean that my relationship will work out, or that I've cracked the code for this type of relationship. I was going through this sub looking for support and I noticed the amount of people that is trapped in this cycle/dinamic of Avoidant and Anxious so I thought it would be good to give my input. 


I remembered another task I was given by my therapist in a very early stage of therapy. 


1. Write down a list of your fears/situations that cause you anxiety

2. This list can be events that already happened, stuff that will happen or imaginary scenarios in your head that give you anxiety/fear. 

3. Rate each event according to:
""from 0 to 100% how much fear/anxiety this event gives me?"" 
And 
""From 0 to 100% how much do I want to avoid this situation?"" 

Conclusion:
1. This was one of the hardest tasks I had to do. I was constantly writing down stuff on this list. I realized the amount of fears and anxiety I had over imaginated scenarios and scenarios that would potentially happen in the future (for ex. Going out for a social event, what if he meets someone interesting?!). 

It was really insane when I look back into it tbh. 

2. It was very hard to be objective on the % of fear and avoidant but it was also very important and interesting. I had wrote situations that I rated over 80% fear but only 10% will to avoid them. 

3. I'm still not sure why this exercise was so hard and at the same time so helpful for me. But it really was. 

4. Eventually I decided to share my entire list with my boyfriend, I guessed that vulnerability plays a big role into healing as well. I had to let go of my defense mechanisms and learn to be honest and vulnerable. 


Biggest realisation about this:

My boyfriend, like many avoidants, or let's say, like many people, also had a lot of insecurities. 
Many of the events I chose to write, he had also felt anxiety over them. 
He was not the only one in this relationship to fear that I was going to abandon them. 
It's in a different way, and they also show it in a different way, but once you realize that you both share similar feelings with opposite reactions you feel much more connected.",ze7np4,41,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ze7np4/anxious_and_avoidant_how_are_we_making_things/,AnxiousAttachment,1
752,Why(literally) isn’t neediness attractive?,"No I don’t mean it rhetorically, I am actually very confused. 

Besides my abandonment issues, I know that I was anxious in my previous situationship because I felt that it would make her feel special. I try to hold on to people, I forgive them very easily and really don’t even get mad if they explain themselves, no matter how hurt I felt when they did the thing.

So when I compromised on my needs not being met, I thought I was being a strong guy(an attractive quality).
When my anxiety kicked in and I acted a bit needy, I usually said “I don’t want to lose you, you’re special to me”, and I really meant it. She had an immensely positive impact on my life.
I haven’t had anybody be needy for me, but why isn’t all of this attractive?

753,relationships are like a party 🥳,"I had a going away party last night, and it inspired a weird relationship metaphor idea.......

I threw the party at a karaoke bar. At the beginning, I felt stressed because I felt responsible for everyone having a place to sit, and all I could think about was are there going to be enough seats for everyone. 

But then as the party grew bigger, people drifted away from the main table, and I was happier, because everyone was doing their own thing and having fun and not reliant on me, and then i could have fun.

I feel like what my partner wants is for me to be like my party guests. That I'm looking out for myself and having fun and will be ok without his help. 

For me this means having an active social life, practicing self care, foregrounding meeting my own needs, prioritizing my interests and career instead of being preoccupied with the relationship, and having boundaries about what I will accept. Then the party can be relaxing !

756,The One,"It's not always the dumpee. As someone that recently dumped someone I loved whole heartedly. It's not always by choice. I gave so much of myself and I tried so hard because I loved him admittedly more at times than I loved myself. That was the problem though and it built resentment in me. I didn't want to give up but I had to. I did so much self work the past year and a half. (Therapy. Reading constantly about how to self soothe anxiety and be more secure, learning strategies to apply everyday) I can honestly say I'm the most secure I've ever been. I don't regret my time with him because I  grew. I became self-aware. I forced myself to become more aware of how my insecurities clashed with all my relationships be that friends, family,  and him. I was anxious and he's still avoidant. I'm pretty sure dismissive avoidant. I remember thinking that if I become secure than maybe I could keep him, but the more I tried the more evident it became. He's okay with not having to work on himself or maybe he's unaware. Regardless he can see how his actions hurt because I communicated it. In the end a lot of his insecurities ate away at my love for him. I had my own insecurities and I faced them because I knew that I wanted to be better for us both.. I guess I just thought for the longest time that he'd be willing to do the same for me. I saw myself reverting back to my anxious tendencies and that's when I knew. I had to love myself more. That if he couldn't love me the way I deserved, than I would. Today he broke NC just to pretty much insinuate I'm the one giving up. I express myself and he ignored it. So if you're out there reading this. Choose you. You deserve love and  you deserve someone that sees you; that knows your worth.

758,My DA ex refuses to let me go,"(We're both in our late 20s, our relationship lasted 5 years and we have no kids together)

We broke up and went no contact. I started making progress but I still missed him. I didn't reach out to him until his sister, who I'm still friendly with, mentioned that he was struggling to deal with the break up and really regrets hurting me. This made me cave and I sent him a message asking if he was alright. I had no intention to take it further. After we exchanged a few messages I wished him well and said goodbye. He responded by basically writing an essay about how wrong he was, how sorry he is and how he wants us to make the relationship work. He even said he is willing to go to therapy. We met up in person a few times and he repeated the same sentiments. I thought about it and decided to give him one final chance given how clear and direct he sounded.

We started again. And suddenly he started changing his mind about the future again. Suddenly he was pretending he never said certain things or he would downplay the seriousness of what he said. Then when I asked him if he still wanted to work things out he said he was no longer sure. I took a step back and said we should not see each other anymore until we've figured things out and SUDDENLY he wanted a future together. 

We tried again. Same dance.

I finally sent a message saying its over because I will never become secure this way and I need to take care of myself first before being with someone. He begged and pleaded.

Now he's gotten his sister involved. She wants to Zoom some time this week to talk about it and she says she wants me and him to get back together. I told her no and she sent another message basically trying to get me to get on Zoom with her.

I just know how it's going to be. Every single time I give in to his promises, he disappoints me. But he won't take no for an answer anymore.

My anxiety is making me scared to block them. I'm also not used to setting boundaries (though I've been getting better since I started reading self-help books and taking better care of myself).

I guess i know what I have to do but I needed a place to vent.

Not cool, completely toxic but I was pushed to limits where my brain became completely overwhelmed by the situation. I couldn’t handle it. It’s not an excuse, it’s just my truth.

So now I wonder how do I react in a secure way next time someone ghosts/ignores me? I also wonder why being ignored is so triggering for me…

Of course I am not as secure as I'd like otherwise I would have walked away longer. But the majority of the anxiety I displayed while with him were only ever with him. In other relationships and even situationships, there was never this much anxiety. At some point I honestly thought I needed meds. Turns out I developed an anxious attachment while with him, which contributed to me staying.

761,Finally broken up,"We've (F28/F29) been on the rocks for ages and trying to repair things. Or, I was. I finally asked her today, 'Are you trying to stay because you want to, or because you're afraid to leave?'. 

It was the latter. Because she's never dumped anyone before. Because she was afraid that breaking up with me would hurt me, not realising she's been slowly distancing from me anyway and hurting me that way. Eventually she admitted it and apologised for being 'a coward' and stringing me along. She hadn't been feeling it for a while but kept telling me to just wait it out, be patient, if I just did this and that and stopped wanting things from her she'd come around etc. I guess it is almost mutual, since I did open up that conversation, but she pulled the plug. 

It's funny how quickly you normalise some of the fucked up dynamics you get into, and then when it's over you realise. We had a rocky start, as our relationship brought up a lot of past trauma for me that I had to work hard on in therapy (and largely came out the other side). But the guilt I felt from that truly messed me up and set the stage for our relationship. Here's some highlights:

- Had no idea what she was feeling most of the time, or what she needed to feel loved in a relationship 
- despite that, expected me to just know what her needs were without communication. I mostly just had to guess
- Didn't *want* to communicate her needs to me or even give me a chance to disappoint her, because she felt I already had too much going on so she shouldn't bother to ask. So she felt the relationship was imbalanced but I hardly ever got a chance to rebalance it 
- Admitted that when it came to big stuff I was always there for her. But that was mostly accidental and me reaching out, not because she asked for it. 
- Could not think of a single thing she wanted to work on in our relationship, or to just make herself happier. She kept saying 'Can't you just tell me what I did wrong so I can work on it?'. I can think of 1000 conversations I've had talking about changes I want to make and followed through on. And yet, she would keep telling me that she was doing everything in the relationship 
- Did not set any boundaries with me around supporting me emotionally; secretly resented me for going over the invisible line and I didn't know til it was too late
- she kept 'score' of the fact that she had to support me emotionally through a lot of trauma, and then when the relationship started going awry, kept bringing this up as though I was in debt to her and should put up with anything she threw at me as a result. Not denying it was hard for her, but this transactional attitude was really damaging and made me feel lesser than her the entire time we were together. 
- When I started to notice and change our codependent pattern, she got angry and offended. As in 'I've been trying to be there for you and apparently I've just been doing it all wrong!'. No recognition of it how she played into it. Or even recognition of how it made things harder for us. 

It's been interesting having a relationship with a DA that is also very codependent, as she was so fixated on 'helping' me. I guess it was a way of avoiding herself, but also keeping me at bay. Because she had already set me up to fail and disappoint her. 

This will definitely be my last relationship with a DA haha - I guess you have to exhaust yourself sometimes before you can admit defeat. I can't say I haven't learned tons though. Was I perfect? Absolutely not. But I did definitely ignore a ton of increasingly red flags and I'll take that info with me to the next person. I clearly have some work to do as I was so drawn to someone who had no idea what she was feeling 99% of the time and clearly resented me, but also kept telling me I was imagining stuff like that.

To better relationships, I guess.",tirl39,41,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/tirl39/finally_broken_up/,AnxiousAttachment,1
762,Avoidants Don’t Mean It - Anything to add to my blog post?,"‘Avoidant attachment is what a child develops when their parents don’t show care other than providing essentials like food and shelter. The child disregards their own struggles and needs in order to maintain peace and this is engrained into how they act well into adult life.’

When I first read this, the alarm bells immediately started ringing. When I was growing up my parents were about as emotionally absent as it’s possible to be. No ‘I love you’s, they played down my issues or achievements, and I can even think of a few occasions where my family openly made fun of my problems. I ended up developing a knack for not showing any emotion or any desire for a connection, learning from a very young age to be as independent as possible and to avoid intimacy and reliance on others. 

All of this was subconscious and unintentional, but now that I look back, I can see that there were real physiological reasons for why I wouldn’t want my parents to come and support me playing rugby, why I wouldn’t want to tell them how my day has been, why I’m uncomfortable with others celebrating my birthdays - the list could go on. Closing off from people was my natural protective mechanism and therefore I always saw the downplaying of emotions as a good thing.

So when I met someone who had a really supportive and loving upbringing, she naturally expected me to provide those things too. From supporting her successes to just offering a bit of emotional support when she needed it - things that she shouldn’t have even had to ask for - were all things that I really struggled to do and did not know the importance of since it was all so alien to me. I would become uncomfortable when the relationship got too close, often distancing myself from things such as talking about the future, or even just admitting that I missed her.

It’s a bit like learning a new language: I know I got bits of it right now and again, but I felt stupid for not being fluent so I’d pull myself back into an emotionless retreat and just felt all so normal to me. Understandably, over 2 years of wanting basic things from someone who is unable to provide them is bound to eventually take its toll - issues are left unresolved, needs are not met and its inevitable that they’re going to start to wonder if this is the right person for them, no matter how strong the connection is.

In my case, the girl eventually broke up with me - and I was lucky in the sense that she had the confidence and courtesy to outline the reasons and the things I wasn’t doing for her - which then allowed me to go and research relationships, find out about attachment theory and understand myself better. 

The scary part is that this was far from a neglected or drama-filled relationship - zero arguments, got on stupidly well with family and friends, always great dates/trips, similar humour, encouraged eachother’s freedom etc - what I’m trying to say is it was pretty much was as good as it gets. Even disagreements over things such as genres of music, there was still that baseline shared passion for music that often overlapped.

I truly did love this girl so it’s hard to know the pain I must have caused her. Hope this helps anyone who’s in the same boat as me or has had the experience of dating an avoidant.

764,(UPDATE) I (avoidant) finally sent my ex (AA) an email that I came here with asking for advice. I got a reply from her,"After two days she replied:


O,

I want you to know that your email meant a lot to me; those were words that I felt I needed for quite some time. Our relationship was a very important stepping stone for both of us, a stepping stone that we needed to take in order to become the best version of ourselves. I couldn’t be more grateful for the time that we spent together. You taught me more about myself than I ever thought possible.

Just as you know I would never do something to intentionally hurt you, I know you would never do something to intentionally hurt me. I forgive you.

F


Here’s what I sent to her first:


F,

I want you to know I’m sorry about that last message I sent. It was wrong of me to lash out and accuse you of hurting me on purpose. I know you wouldn’t do that. I was coming to conclusions and that wasn’t right of me to drag you down with me. I was lost and confused as it was my first time going through all that. I know my last text implied it, but I don’t think little of you nor do I hold any resentment. I’m not mad at you or anything like that.

I want to make sure there are no ill feelings between us and to apologize for how I was and the role I played in our relationship ending. After learning about attachment theory, it completely crushed me when I discovered I’m avoidant and the implications that came along with that. I believe it played a large role in our relationship.

It was a horrible feeling when I realized how I made you feel. If I hurt you and made you feel dismissed, it was never on purpose. What I once saw as you displaying insecurities may actually have been a reflection of my own dismissive behavior. I now see how that could have been amplified by my actions. I feel terrible knowing I did that to you and can’t apologize enough for that.

You weren’t asking much of me at all and I see that now. You were only asking of me what you needed, which was the bare minimum. I’m truly sorry if I made you feel alone in the relationship. You didn’t deserve that. When I said you were too much that was my avoidant traits trying to justify why I was feeling how I was. In addition, our attachment styles may not have been the most compatible, which caused conflict. I can’t blame everything on that, or me being avoidant, but it didn’t help one bit. 

My lack of compromise, communication, and overall effort only made things worse. I was so passive that I couldn’t even set boundaries which may have led you to make assumptions. I never meant to lead you on. When things got tough all I wanted to do was run away instead of try and work out the issues. It was my first relationship and for some reason that got to me. I wasn’t ready for a serious commitment yet. 

I had such internal conflict when I wasn’t sure why I was feeling how I was. It was really holding me back and causing such turmoil within me, as I had no idea what was happening. Part of me didn’t care to look within to try and figure it out while the other part was scared of what I’d find. I wanted to be alone because that’s when I felt the safest. To be by myself wasn’t to get away from you, it was to get away from the situation and the conflict. I had such a hard time opening up and letting you in when I wasn’t even at that point with myself yet. I wanted a stronger emotional connection but something held me back.

So I want you to know that you had such an impact on my life that you made me want to change for the better. I wouldn’t reach out and tell you all this if you didn’t mean to me as you do. I’ll always care about you no matter what and wouldn’t take back our time together for anything. You’ll always have a special place in my heart. I’m going to do everything I can to get better and be a more complete person.

I feel like I gave you no other choice and in a way forced you to end it with me and that was wrong of me. I want to make sure you know it’s not your fault for how I was. Your needs were more than valid. I don’t blame your decision to end it at all as I showed no signs of changing. 

Sincerely,
O


Her saying we were stepping stones to each other didn’t feel too good to read. I see what she’s saying but still. I know my email has a similar tone to her response but I didn’t mean for it to sound like she was just experience to me. It’s just that it took being broken up with for me to see what I needed to see and to want to change.

If her response makes it sound like she’s completely done and with someone else that’s because she is. The day before I sent the email I learned that she’s dating the person she left me for. To learn she’s been in a relationship the entire time we’ve been broken up really hurt. If anything that made it easier to send the email, as the pressure was off.

For more context: 

We dated for a year and a few months before she called it quits. We broke up four and a half months ago. It was three months of no contact before I sent the email.",scgif2,42,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/scgif2/update_i_avoidant_finally_sent_my_ex_aa_an_email/,AnxiousAttachment,1
765,Broken up,"I was dating this guy I really liked but he could not cope with my anxiety and need for reassurance. Since I was also having difficulty expressing my needs and ended up expressing them through taunts, he thought he was always disappointing me and that made him push himself away further. 

So all in all, he said that he does not want to help me figure out my anxiety, I know what he has to offer and that I should quit this relationship if it is giving me anxiety. Although he didn't break up with me, he didn't really give me any space to go any other way. 

I think that the break up was the right thing to do- my anxiety is ever present and while I am working on it, I do need someone who understands and supports me through it.

Yet it's hard to not feel unlovable. No one really wants to deal with people with issues and anxiety. I have got obsessed with and insecure about every guy I have ever liked, and it's hard to see light at the end of the tunnel.",rms0el,39,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/rms0el/broken_up/,AnxiousAttachment,1
766,I’m tired of my attachment style being demonised (bit of a convoluted rant),"I was listening to a podcast recently (we can do hard things, with Glennon Doyle) and they were discussing conflict. One of the things that came up was that during conflict, we put on our personal bullet proof jacket that helps us to feel less vulnerable. This can look like shutting down, or getting loud, or acting like a lawyer (well your honour, here are all the facts as to why I’m right.) Whatever it is, it’s a layer on top of the real us so that during conflict, you’re more so dealing with my “representative” than the real me. 

For some reason this just clicked in my brain as how we respond to things is just different, not better or worse. I’m a product of my upbringing and the experiences I’ve had since then. My attachment style is just more visible, more prominent, and so it gets the attention for being the less than ideal one. We think and worry constantly, and so we naturally pick everything apart, including ourselves. 

But our attachment style itself isn’t *bad.* It’s just different. It’s my bullet proof jacket trying to protect me. It’s my representative on high alert making sure I’m kept safe. It can be hard for me to deal with, because the constant ticker tape and getting triggered is exhausting, but it’s not bad. Avoidants pulling away can hurt just as much. And secure individuals can have elements of either attachment style too, because no one is perfect, no one had a perfect childhood, and situations can trigger responses in any of us. 

I don’t think I will ever be 100% secure, whatever that really means. But I deserve someone who recognises that my anxious attachment has nothing to do with what kind of person I am. I still deserve someone kind and loving. I deserve someone who can support me through my strong emotions like I would support them. Who can understand that when I’m ramped up, it isn’t personal and I’m not a villain. Who can love me through hard moments and repair after them. 

I want to be more secure for me, because I’m exhausted. Because I want to fully experience the beauty of relationships without worrying what’s around the corner. But I’m not a bad person who needs to fix herself to be worthy of something wonderful. I’m just different. Just like everyone else is different. Our differents don’t have to be compatible, but it doesn’t mean my version is the wrong one. 

Anyway. I guess I’m just saying that it’s okay to want to be more secure, but don’t blame or hate yourself as you are now, because you’re not a villain. You’re just different.",rjzv26,42,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/rjzv26/im_tired_of_my_attachment_style_being_demonised/,AnxiousAttachment,1
767,[Update] Have any APs successfully repaired their relationship with a DA?,"Original post: https://reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/rbboag/have_any_aps_successfully_repaired_their/

~Forewarning: Possible onion cutting below~

---

Following encouraging and motivating words from many in this community (which I really appreciate), I decided I needed to sit my ex down and explain to her what I've discovered about myself and about us. I didn't want to convey a sense of urgency, but deep down I was absolutely restless in waiting to show her the recent epiphanies I had had.

She obliged and was generous enough to come over again. We sat down and I shared the articles and works of Briana MacWilliam and Thais Gibson. I pulled up a document I put together which broke down the concepts, supplemented by annotations and examples relevant during our relationship. I talked about how I, as a DA, had immense difficulty in feeling my deepest emotions and knowing whether or not I was in love. I told her that as she was an AP, she poured her heart out and dove head first into the relationship with the desire to have her love reciprocated, but pathologically did not expect it back which caused her to only try harder. And so we were the participants of a classic AP-DA entanglement, constantly pushing and pulling, a cliche that has resonated through one too many romantic dramas.

She expressed that while she was aware of her anxious issues, she was not aware of how dysfunctional our dynamic inherently was nor was she aware of my impairments. She expressed how she felt all of her emotions immensely and could not relate to how I felt very little of mine. And despite that our relationship being defined by a deep caring and mutual respect for one another, it was tragically a lack of understanding of our attachment styles and our dynamic which resulted in a turbulent affair and ultimately a falling out.

I expressed that with this newfound knowledge, I plan to reform myself through therapy and to grow moving forward by practicing vulnerability and encouraging myself to reach out to and properly convey my emotions. I told her we were the product of a misunderstanding and that neither of us should blame ourselves for not knowing. I asked her to consider giving us another chance in the future if she could find it in her heart.

Through great gratitude and admiration for my efforts to unpack and explain to her what had entailed, she expressed that alas, her heart had sailed and she had moved on to a process of healing. She reminded me that this wasn't even our first break up and that at this point, she has given this dance her best and that she had danced enough.

She told me thank you for being a good person, for going the extra step to empathize and to resolve, and for communicating such thoughts. And with tears, she expressed that it had been a pleasure to know me and it had been a gift to have us. I returned the sentiment and swallowed the fate. Then I hugged her and sent her on her way.

After that, I went to my bed and I cried.

It was then that I realized I was not crying for the pure reason of grief, but for reasons of reassurance in knowing that it was pain that I had finally felt. It was my emotions that had began to surface and it was my emotions that allowed me to feel such distress. My heart reminded me that through years of childhood abuse and psychological trauma, it still had resilience and that if I dug deep enough, somewhere down there were remnants of love and hope beneath barriers of what is ultimately characterized as fear. I realized that I had feared enough and lived with enough trauma that came with telling me as a boy that boys don't cry, and crying was for the weak. It was time that I had embraced the human condition inherent to all of us, and it is time for many others suffering from similar manifestations to recognize the same.

And so I let the tears flow.",rdhs0q,39,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/rdhs0q/update_have_any_aps_successfully_repaired_their/,AnxiousAttachment,1
768,A break off letter to my situationship of 9 months,"
A letter to my Avoidant partner. 
I’m glad that we got to share a bit of each other’s journeys for awhile. I’ve learned a lot about myself. I’ve also enjoyed hearing the stories and people that have shaped your life. I’ve tried my best to be patient and understanding. I know I’ve stumbled and I’m not always the most graceful at handling conflict. Thanks for being patient. I admire how grounded and logical you are.
 
I don’t feel valued or appreciated. I feel like my efforts to make time for you haven’t been reciprocated. I visited you almost every Tuesday for months. I never complained about the drive, having to adjust my schedule, or the traffic. It was hard to not take it personally when you made time for a two day fundraiser, but you couldn’t find 30 minutes to drive to me. It was hard to hear your excuses to not visit me-car rental, traffic, hating the drive, work. I was hopeful when we talked about compromising, but things changed nominally. I missed the man who took initiative and made plans to see me. 

I’m a strong believer that people are never too busy to make time for the people they care about. I felt like an after thought at times. I hated being your last minute plans. I didn’t understand how you could make concrete plans for training or business meetings, but not me. The big gaps in responses. I felt like we only saw each other at the convenience of your schedule. I rarely got asked when it would be a good time for me to hang. I’m not comfortable being exclusive for so long without consistent effort. I still don’t understand the hold up with the green card and being in a relationship. I feel like I’ve gotten a lot of mixed signals. I get the impression that you’ve got other priorities-career and business stuff. I respect that and want you to reach your goals. 

I cooked for you. Doted on Daisy. Cleaned the dishes. Wrote you sweet notes. Asked so many questions to try and get to know you. Extended so many invites to spend time or go on adventures. I felt hurt when you wouldn’t get back to me on plans. I wanted you to feel special and cared for. I was met with such reluctance and ambivalence. I rarely felt appreciated for my efforts. I never felt like you wanted to hear about my interests or the stories that shaped who I am. I know you’re an observer, but at some point people do get curious and start asking questions. 
 
I’m sorry for the times I’ve made you feel like you’re not enough or unappreciated.  My criticalness is something I’m still learning to soften. I’m saying all of this to be known and to allow myself to let them go. I appreciate your efforts to improve communication. I liked how you called more and how you didn’t seem to be in a rush to do other things. I don’t think we’re a good fit for each other because my needs are not getting met and it seems like we’re wanting different things. I’m sad things didn’t work out. I’m glad we still got to meet each other. I wish you the very best. I think you have a lot to offer. I’m hopeful that we’ll find people who are able to fully appreciate ourselves. Thank you for the good memories.",q4d7eh,39,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/q4d7eh/a_break_off_letter_to_my_situationship_of_9_months/,AnxiousAttachment,1
769,72 dates - Dating for 20 years and Spritual Exhaustion,"I’ve been on 72 dates in the last 20 years. I am tired. I am very tired. No one can tell me that I have not tried to meet someone. I have put up with a lot from shitty partners, and I feel so much shame, but I don’t think people realize how hard it is to find someone good, someone that makes you feel seen. After 20 years of trying, my soul is so hungry for authentic desire, authentic communication, and the chance at peace. 

I have learned a lot about settling. Just nice is not enough. Just handsome is not enough. Just smart is not enough. Just emotionally available is not enough. I used to think when I got older that it was going to get easier by the time I hit 40, but the list of boxes to check has only gotten longer. My despair grows as I realize the true extent of my needs—how difficult it is to find someone smart, stimulating, physically attractive, kind, emotionally available, and ready for commitment, and for fuck’s sake that I like and who likes me back.  

There is so much shame put on women for not choosing well. If someone is unavailable to us, it’s our fault. Our radar was off, and every acceptance of shitty behavior is an accountability failure. We could have moved on. What’s missing in the litany of advice is **pleasure**. Who actually gave you pleasure? Who actually stimulated your mind or your soul or your body? And the idea that pleasure should come first—actually feeling good next to your partner goes out the window once someone isn’t texting back due to fear of intimacy. 

It has not been my choice to keep moving on. I recognize my own accountability, and I have been in therapy for 7 years. I have read self-help books. I have trolled reddit for answers. I admittedly have anxious attachment behaviors that have likely thwarted my attempts at love, that have drawn me to the wrong partners, but I truly believe that there are many people out there with similar struggles as me who have partners, who have found someone they like and who will try to put up with them, and then there’s me. Why am I single? This is often one of the most hurtful questions I am asked. If I knew, I would do everything in my power to fix it. 

A part of me thinks that I am worthy, very worthy, and living in this camp is the angry side as opposed to the self-hating side. The turmoil is less caustic but still bitter. Both extremes of response—anger and shame—they both leave me alone. If I am good enough, it simply means that I haven’t been lucky, and that feels like being a different kind of loser. It also leaves me helpless with no recourse of what I can do to fix it. 

I am familiar with buddhist ideas of cultivating presence and finding ways to move through the loneliness. It will pass, I know it will pass, but I have spent the majority of the last 20 years killing time. I work on myself, I plan trips, I invest in hobbies. I have a PhD and I like to paint. I work out and can deadlift over 200 pounds. I am familiar with all of the proposed methods for creating a fulfilling life. I have joined volunteer groups and clubs. I volunteered at an animal shelter, I got a membership at a feminist makerspace. I make art, I watched all 10 Hellraiser movies with nerdy delight. I planned trips to Montreal and Atlanta. 

But all I really want in life is someone to hug at the end of the day. I would trade in my PhD for a partner. 

One of the hardest parts about being constantly single is that you’re no one’s first priority. My friends are lovely and supportive and funny and kind, but I can’t lean on them the same way I could a partner. You see friends sporadically. They have lives and children and important reasons why I **should not** be a high priority for them. There is no one in my life who I am even in the top three for. My father is deceased, and my mother has mental health challenges. 

I wake up many days and I don’t know how to go forward. This is what a mid-life crisis feels like. I do not feel the enormous potential that everyone tells me I have to change things. My debt from my life and my emotional disappointments weigh heavily on me.

770,Our worst fear happened to me tonight,"Hey all, 
My name is Liz. I’m a nurse and in grad school to become a NP. I’ve been struggling with AA for a while. 

This guy was planning to move down to my state for a while. While he was looking at apartments, he set his hinge location here. We matched when he was back home. We ended up talking all day every day (3 hour phone calls at night) and really just having a great cobbection for about a month. He moved her on Monday. We had a fantastic first date on Wednesday, lunch on Thursday, and went out to dinner and drinks last night with my sister and her bf. My anxiety really didn’t show early on because it was so fluid and easy. However after real feelings developed, I got anxious. I asked him yesterday if something was wrong and he said no. Last night, we agreed to be exclusive and delete our dating apps. 

This morning everything was normal. The whole day was normal. Fast forward to tonight- I get a text and he basically says he doesn’t see us working out long term. He went on to explain that he got a bad gut feeling last night about us and hasn’t been able to shake it. This guy is very honest and I know if it was something else or someone else, he would have told me. He said he was 100% in until this feeling last night. He was literally talking about the future less than 24 hours ago- how could this happen? I just don’t get it? 
I deleted his number and history so I am unable to contact him. I have a feeling he will come back but I will not allow it. My heart physically hurts.

772,does anyone else get desperately lonely?,"i'd say by far the hardest thing about this attachment style, at least for me, is that it makes me absolutely DESPERATE for connection and togetherness. i can't think of anyone else in my life who so deeply needs to have companionship the way i do. the pandemic has taught me to be much more okay being alone (like really, really really alone, like not speaking to a human person for multiple days on end) than i ever was before, but still... i don't like it. and i don't even necessarily want a partner for that - i'm desperate for any connection! friendship! family! and yeah, a romantic partner would be the best of all because they can be my companion for everything!

i live with one roommate, a longtime friend, and as much as i love him it's sometimes hard to live with him. all he does is wake up, go to work all day, come home, game, and go to sleep. i get to talk to him a little bit but my brain is desperately craving deep, meaningful conversations and connection. i have plenty of other friends but i can't see them every day. i try my best to strategically plan out my week so that i have some staggered friend time and alone time. i'm in a book club that i love, i have plenty of hobbies and interests.... but absolutely nothing compares to the feeling of companionship and togetherness. that's what i want, at the end of the day. that's what i'm craving more than anything, and a love interest is the quickest way to get that. i don't have a friend that would be my everyday companion.

it's shocking how much having a companion in the form of a romantic partner impacts my happiness. i was dating this guy for a month and a half last month, and while i knew he wasn't the right person for me, i was significantly happier and more emotionally stable day-to-day. i don't think i cried once that entire month and a half. so going back to nothingness is hard.

i also wanna say that this is very clearly being amplified by the pandemic and the fact that i work full-time from home (i did even before the pandemic!!) - if i had an in-person job, i wouldn't be having this issue. i'd probably be craving alone time instead, lmao. one of my first orders of business is to find an in-office job instead of a full remote one. i can't go a full day sitting in my house alone. as relaxing as it is to work at my own pace, i really really need to make human connections with others during the day. i'd say i'm definitely an introverted people-person. my second order of business is to make more deep meaningful friendships and expand and deepen my existing ones. third order of business is to find an amazing partner. i feel like my ""picker"" has been steadily improving over the past year... i just want something to work out. for once. lmao.

thanks for reading, i just really needed to rant, lol. i spent a lot of tonight just sobbing my eyes out, wishing i had someone to talk to. literally anyone. which feels crazy because i have friends and a roommate but i just want someone to sit next to me and give me a hug. alright thanks for reading if you did, it's time to sleep lol",m1rkjl,41,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/m1rkjl/does_anyone_else_get_desperately_lonely/,AnxiousAttachment,1
773,text anxiety is killing me,"i don’t want to be this way about texting but i’m having to accept that i am

when i’m into someone and they don’t text frequently my anxiety skyrockets

and the worst part is the more someone indulges me the worse it gets.. the anxiety goes from oh shit she didn’t reply for like 12 hours to oh shit she didn’t reply in 2 hours 

it’s not even about oh who’s she talking to or what is she doing it’s more just that i want to hear from them all the time as it kind of reaffirms their interest in me 

this new girl i’m talking with has a very busy schedule and i’m respective of that but the text game has been rough

774,Anxiously attached people tend to experience more personal growth.,"I've been struggling to get through a breakup and recently discovered attachment styles. I was clearly anxious and my former partner avoidant. It was really enlightening and allowed me to put perspective on an unhealthy relationship that I was idealizing. 

I read the Attached book this week, and have been very interested in the topic since. I found this article today stating that following a breakup, anxiously attached people experience more personal growth and self-discovery than avoidant people.

775,Boundaries? What’s that?,Hey all!  I have been picking apart my recent dating history now that I have a bit of self-awareness about my insecure attachment style to identify my triggers and try to form health boundaries.  It occurs to me that I have never been able to set boundaries.  I always feared that the person I was with would leave if I tried to enforce any.  So I am asking honestly… what are some examples of healthy boundaries that you have set in relationships to help preserve your peace?

776,"Exploring the Relationship between Attachment Style, Sexuality, and Emotional Connection","Hi everyone. I've recently noticed an intriguing pattern in my relationship, specifically regarding the impact of sex on my emotional connection and perception of my partner. I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and insights on this topic. Here's my situation:

I am an AA/secure dating someone who I presume is FA. We have been dating for a year and everything has been going very well, great communication, needs, boundaries, space, everything well met both side. 

But recently I've been thinking my relationship with sexuality and how it links with my attachment style. 

I have a high desire for sex but I wonder if it's simply a high libido or if it's tied to my attachment style. Could be both. One of my main love language is physical touch and sexuality is a big part of it. Especially to feel loved/appreciated. I have a hard time feeling appreciated if we don't have sex. Doesn't need to be a full intercourse but at least making out, feeling each others, etc. Even in weekdays, sometimes we meet fairly late after long days and none of us really has energy for sex but I would still give her a bit of oral sex or receive it, even for a short time and not seeking orgasm.

Recently we are both busy and don't spend a lot of quality time with each others, and we are also having less sex that we used to and less sex that i would want to. Unsurprisingly, I often feel rejected (not too much, I've become good at being reasonnable) and try to hide any dismay but internally I start to be anxious, not about her not liking me enough but more about our long term compatibility and the fate of our relationships, etc. It makes me feel more disconnected from her, I become more aware of her flaws and more critical, etc. Which maybe looks like it's more from the avoidant playbook?

When we do have sex I feel great, connected, safe, etc. 

It's annoying that my well-being is so dependant of having sex or not, not the least because I have a libido that not everyone can match, and I'm also not selecting partners only on that criterion, so I feel like I'm set up for failure, and I should just accept to deal better with these feelings of rejection. At the same time, it could also be the AA talking (I'm too much, I want too much, etc.)

If anyone can relate, share their experience, give opinion about it, or ask questions if I failed to explain clearly, you guys are welcome!

779,"My (secure) partner of 4 months maintains a friendship with a woman he’s been intimate with, and I (anxious) am having a really hard time with it.","So, I want to preface this by saying I know 4 months isn’t a long time. It’s long enough to know how I feel and how he feels though, and honestly, most days (lol), we’re pretty crazy about each other. 

We’ll call the woman Jane. Jane snap chatted him on Super Bowl Sunday and I didn’t recognize her name, so I (innocently) asked who she was. My partner said “A friend of an old coworker” and left it at that.

We were watching a show last night and the topic of being friends with the opposite sex came up. I realized I hadn’t ever heard him really talk about any girl friends, so I asked, and he said “I mean, x,y,z, and Jane and I are friends and talk sometimes, yeah.” 

Jane. Good ol Jane. So I then asked if he had been intimate with any of them, and he said yes, Jane. Two years ago. He said they decided they worked better as friends, and it was more of a hookup than anything. He said they had been there for each other in rough times, and that they maintain the kind of friendship where they talk occasionally and will go out to drinks sometimes. 

So, I spiraled. I told him I felt like he purposefully left out the fact they had slept together when I asked who she was the first time, and he said he just didn’t think about it because it’s been so long ago and they haven’t been intimate in years. 

We went back and forth about it, and rather than making him cut off contact (which I initially wanted, I won’t lie, as controlling as that is), I told him I’d try to be okay with them talking as friends but wouldn’t be comfortable with them seeing each other privately and as a “couple” going for drinks or dinner. 

He agreed on those boundaries. He knows I’m hurting and offered to cut her off completely, but I know that will only build resentment, and I don’t want that. 

Honestly, I want to be okay with this. I want to not think about the fact that they slept together and he’s seen her naked, and I want to be able to trust him completely when he says she’s not someone to worry about. I just don’t know how, so I’m here.

786,Intimacy & Infidelity - My Attachment Theory Perspective,"These are my theories about how and why each attachment style *may* cheat in relationships.

The most important thing to emphasize is that I'm offering explanations, not excuses. Unless a couple is in an explicitly non-monogamous relationship, cheating is unethical and grounds for immediate breakup.

This information is meant to help understand the attachment styles' reaction to intimacy and perception of infidelity. It is not meant to encourage bending ourselves into pretzels to prevent a partner from straying, or rationalizing hurtful behavior. As always, AT is about the individual first, the dynamic second, and the other person a distant third.

Finally, while some hints of our attachment insecurities may be visible in the dating stages, casually seeing more than one person early on is normal and generally healthy. Before a relationship has become committed and sexual exclusivity has been agreed upon, all parties are considered free agents. My descriptions are only relevant to longer-term relationships, as our most destructive impulses never fully come online until we've become deeply emotionally invested.

**SECURE**

People with secure attachment are not saints. They're not above developing feelings for and attraction to other people while in a committed relationship. They may even participate in less than honorable behavior like heavy flirting, or the type of communication that might be interpreted as an emotional affair. However, they eventually see their wandering eye and straying heart as symptoms, not the cause, of dissatisfaction in their primary relationship. At that point they would either communicate with their partner about their unmet needs and attempt to resolve them, or terminate the relationship. They may take up immediately with a new partner, or may choose to be single for awhile. Not every relationship is built for the long-term, and not every relationship that begins quickly after the last is a toxic rebound.

If confronted, the response may be ""I'm so sorry. What can I do for your forgiveness?""

**ANXIOUS**

If a person with anxious attachment cheats, they are attempting to fill a void. That void may feel like a general unhappiness in their relationship, but is often more granular. They are seeking attention and affection, and may even cheat openly in an attempt to provoke possessive behaviors in their partner. The AA feels so empty without an attachment figure, they are unwilling to end one relationship before beginning another. They will hold onto both until security with either is confirmed, then may juggle the two (or others) as insecurities continue to arise and the only solution to their distress, they feel, is external validation. They do not see themselves as cheating, but as being desperately driven to get their needs met.

If confronted, the response may be ""I only cheated because you made me to it!""

**DISMISSIVE**

While a DA might take longer to agree to exclusivity, if they explicitly commit to a relationship, they usually mean it. Problems arise, as they always do for DAs, when they fail to communicate their struggles with intimacy. All that closeness begins to chafe. They feel incapable of expressing needs and boundaries effectively, so resentment builds, their esteem for their partner is diminished, and a new relationship feels easy and pressure-free. The DA tends to hide their affair because they don't feel they have the bandwidth to handle the emotional fallout of discovery and breakup. They may date soon after the breakup, but continue to keep others at arms' length.

If confronted, the response may be ""Ok, you got me. Let's just break up.""

**FEARFUL**

FAs are terrified of love. To love someone is to give them power over their heart, and the prospect of heartbreak feels like it'd be a wound from which they'd never recover. Many FAs have traumatic backgrounds, and distrust their ability to function normally in the aftermath of traumatic events. They feel inherently unlovable, so feel it's inevitable that their partner will leave them and they'll be emotionally annihilated. Regardless of how much reassurance they're given, the FA is forever waiting for the other shoe to drop. If an FA cheats, it is to diffuse the power one person has over their wellbeing. By dividing that power among others, they assuage this anxiety. While they hide the affair because they are loath to hurt the one they love, this self-fulfilling prophecy orchestrates the very cause of their abandonment.

If confronted, the response may be ""I don't know what is wrong with me. I'm falling apart.""

787,Do AP's deactivate in reverse post-break up?,"Hear me out. We're all familiar with the deactivation process an FA/DA may go through, often when a relationship is going well and things start to get serious. But do AP's go through this process in reverse after a break-up? After an avoidant partner has ended things with me, I am overwhelmed by grief. The following thoughts may cycle through my head: I'll never find anyone like them again. We had such a rare and amazing connection. How could they just give up on it? They were so special and amazing. They were everything I was looking for. etc, etc. 

These feelings may persist for some period of time. But as time goes on and you come out of la la land, there's this feeling of..... waitaminute. They weren't that special. A lot of this was me idealizing. A lot of this was in my head. In fact, they treated me poorly in a number of ways that I chose to ignore during the relationship. There were multiple red flags I willingly overlooked. In fact, I ignored a lot of these things because of my own fear of abandonment and a scarcity mindset. But a lot of the things they gave me that I thought were ""so special,"" there's probably many people out there that could do that. This wasn't some incredible ability unique to them. A lot of the things I thought were special about them actually came from me and my openness and my willingness to be vulnerable. 

What would you guys call this? Healing, possibly. Maybe even becoming more secure post-break up and rediscovering my self-worth. But it almost feels like a reverse of deactivation? While avoidants may break up because they think the relationship is no good, months will then pass and they'll begin idealizing that person. Whereas I feel like I do the exact opposite - will idealize them even more after breaking up, until enough time has passed where I'm like... yeah, they weren't that special lmao. There were things I liked about them, but I'm sure I could find someone out there who has those qualities and is possibly even better than them.",xn20ef,40,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/xn20ef/do_aps_deactivate_in_reverse_postbreak_up/,AnxiousAttachment,1

789,Apparently I’m just incapable of not smothering my partner.,"Feeling frustrated, you guys. I long for connection, constantly, and try so hard to remind myself of all the little things my avoidant partner doesn’t like so that he can stay in a good mood and hopefully want to connect with me on his own terms later, but in the meantime I find myself feeling lonely and resentful. 

He’s home from work in a few minutes, I made him dinner. He called me to tell me he was coming home but didn’t want to talk. I get the feeling it’s gonna be one of those nights where we sit and watch tv in silence, again. 

It’s been a toxic pattern of mine that I try to follow my “rules” for how to respond all up until I reach a breaking point and then lash out at him for not wanting to cuddle with me in bed/talk before we go to sleep, etc. 

It seems like even when I know what I need to do (leave him alone, give him space, try to not make him feel obligated to connect when he isn’t in the mood), I sabotage myself in the end every time and wind up screwing it all up anyway because I get emotional and nothing triggers my partner like seeing me get upset. (Another thing that devastates me— if I cry during conflict, he just gets pissed at me.)

792,When Anxious Attachment traps you in a toxic relationship,"There appear to be two main situations recurrently described on this sub.

1) Someone is in a relationship they can tell is good, with a partner who's loving and caring, and yet they experience *irrational* anxiety; an anxiety that is motivated by their core wounds and trauma, not by the specific relationship itself.

This anxiety can reach critical, impairing levels, such as total inability to function when the partner isn't physically present at all times, or isn't in contact at all times. The self-esteem is entirely dependent on the partner. The partner can do anything to be soothing and comforting, but the core issues remain.

In such cases, the problem is definitely the anxiety in and of itself, and **the only solution is to get to work to resolve that core issue, rather than expect the partner to soothe the** ***symptoms*** of the core issue, which might make it better in the moment but won't solve the underlying problem, which will keep presenting itself. It's not easy and it requires hard work, but it's the only way.

2) Someone is in a relationship that is lacking, bad, unfulfilling, or downright toxic with a distant, neglectful, or downright emotionally abusive partner. They *legitimately* experience anxiety which might have been present already and is obviously activated, or they might legitimately experience *reactive situational* anxiety which is directly caused by being neglected or mistreated, intermittent reinforcement, etc.

&#x200B;

Anxiety becomes a trap at that point because:

1) **insecurity and lack of self-confidence prevent one from realizing that the relationship is objectively bad** **because they're not confident that their needs are valid and legitimate**. They question whether the relationship is actually ""normal"" and they're overreacting, or whether it's actually bad.

Maybe I'm expecting too much? Maybe my needs aren't normal, maybe they aren't valid? Maybe I'm just exaggerating? Maybe I'm just being anxious? Maybe my partner isn't that bad? Maybe I just need to suppress my needs and expect nothing? While in the throes of it, it can be very hard to be objective.

They might realise that they need to work on fixing their anxiety, but with a skewed goal: *if I fix my anxiety, I'll be able to squash all my needs and put up with being neglected and mistreated without suffering so I can continue this relationship.* 

But one's anxiety is much harder to fix when it's constantly being triggered, like trying to heal a wound that is constantly being picked at and reopened. And if the anxiety is being directly caused by being mistreated, one fails to see that there's only one solution: **it's like trying to find all sorts of ways to fix having a headache EXCEPT walking away from the person that keeps hitting you with a hammer**. 

2) However, insecurity and lack of self-confidence stop one from seeing that there's no solution except leaving.  **They desperately don't want to accept it because they absolutely don't want to leave.** So they dig for excuses for the neglect / abuse looking for something that will justify them staying: maybe he's avoidant, maybe he's got this or that emotional or psychological issue. They hyperfocus on what's ""wrong"" with the partner and what they can do to ""fix it"" because then everything will be okay.

But it's not your place and not within your abilities to make your partner change. Becoming more secure and confident will make you realise that it's not your job to diagnose them and be a 'case worker' that works to fix their issues. If they thought they had a problem and wanted to fix it, they would do it themselves. If they don't, won't, or can't, you can't control that; you can only control your reaction to the situation, which is to figure out whether you're okay with staying in the situation as it is, or whether you're not and therefore must leave.

This video by Alan Robarge explains it much better than I ever could:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iff1IDKhXSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iff1IDKhXSA)

3) Lastly, insecurity and lack of self-confidence stop you from leaving because they create the classic **AA trap that tells you that your self-esteem and self-worth are directly and solely dependent on this person's validation**, love and approval. That your well-being is directly and solely dependent on clinging to them and keeping them in your life no matter what. 

Becoming more secure and confident means your self-esteem and mental / emotional health don't depend on another person, but on yourself, and so you can leave without being absolutely destroyed. It makes you deeply aware that loving a person is not a good enough reason to stay and endure mistreatment. That you can leave and it's not going to be the end of the world; that you will grieve the loss but you can and will move on with your life to a healthier place.

In conclusion, even when the anxiety is triggered by an objectively bad relationship, putting in the work to fix the anxiety and become more secure is indeed the solution, but the end goal is different: **it's not learning to tolerate the neglect / abuse / dysfunction better, but gaining the ability to understand that your needs are valid, that you shouldn't put up with it**, that it's not acceptable, **that you don't want it,** that you're perfectly within your rights to want better, **and that you can and should leave a situation that's toxic for you.**",t15sq0,41,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/t15sq0/when_anxious_attachment_traps_you_in_a_toxic/,AnxiousAttachment,1

794,Your journey to secure attachment?,"It's been about a year since I started to become aware of attachment theory, and decided to put work into myself to become more secure. At the same time, my partner (DA) and I started couples therapy as we were on the verge of breaking up. 

A year on, I have found that I have not only grown in terms of attachment in romantic relationships, but also all other relationships. I have learned that:

* When your partner habitually 'deactivates', disappears, or ignores you, it's all about them. It's not about you. Because of my own insecurities, I used to blame myself. Now that I love myself more and have more self-compassion, I know that most of the time I didn't do anything to make the other person behave this way. All I can do is express how the behavior makes me feel, and request what I need. It is still hard for me, but I was surprised how rewarding expressing your needs can be, and how responsive others can be.
* If a relationship is unfulfilling, and the other person cannot change their behavior or meet my needs, I should leave for my own wellbeing.
* I used to reach out to others for support for the slightest thing that upset me. Now I feel much more comfortable dealing with distress on my own. (I of course talk big things through with close friends or my partner, but I don't find myself reaching out every time something happens as a way to make me feel better.)

What has helped me? 

* EMDR, schema and Internal Family Systems therapy to deal with childhood trauma and the resulting beliefs (EMDR and IFS have been biggies)
* Practising self-compassion (highly recommend Kristin Neff's work)
* Daily journaling to get more in touch with my own needs and emotions, and see patterns in my behavior and relationships
* Regularly asking myself if I am putting my needs first (something I automatically put second in order to preserve relationships)
* Catching myself when I do protest behavior, and stopping it immediately
* In terms of my relationship, emotionally-focused therapy has helped us recognise the push-pull patterns, and we are in a way better place

The last two weeks have been great! Daily and frequent communication, having amazing dates and being intimate more than we have been in a long time. I've been more open and vulnerable and he has been as well. I've been working on my attachment style the last year and the last couple of months has seen steady improvement on my part. This in turn has brought changes in him as well because he deactivates less.

However, the last two weeks have been intense. Very intense. And he's given more of himself than I've seen in a very long time. On the one hand this makes me very happy. On the other hand, I can smell a deactivation coming 😅 I know this because yesterday, his sister added me in their sibling group chat. I saw the look on his face. He wasn't happy about that. But I kept my cool and pretended like it wasn't even a big deal.

Last time we had a period this intense, he deactivated so badly that it sent me into an anxiety episode and I nearly broke up with him. He becomes such a different person when he deactivates. From warm to ice cold. From caring and considerate to selfish and sometimes even a bit mean and critical. In short, I'm scared 😅

I don't know what I need. I guess a listening ear? I guess support?",s2bo5y,40,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/s2bo5y/when_youre_having_a_great_time_with_an_avoidant/,AnxiousAttachment,1

It took him a couple hours to text back so que anxiety and me preparing for the worst…. 
However, he texted me back saying he “loved” how I communicated that and will definitely work on it.

797,Tired of my dramatic internal reactions and endless irrational fear in my happy healthy relationship,"Finding it hard to fully integrate secure attachment into both my head & heart equally. I believe myself to be in a very happy, healthy, equal and commited relationship that is not codependent (on his end anyway). But my brain acts like it's abusive or something. I very easily fall into fear mode. I expect him to leave, or hurt me, or mistreat me. Even though he never has and gives no impression that he will. But it feels like I'm always prepared for it, like I'm sure it will happen this time! 

Usually this comes up for me in times when he's stressed and wants to decompress and process things by himself. Which is perfectly okay and understandable. My logical brain is okay with it and understands. But there's a part of my mind that gets really triggered by this. My anxious/codependent voice kicks in and says ""you'll never see him again. He doesn't need you. You can't help him. What purpose do you have without that? He's going to abandon you"". So dramatic! Even though it's such a small thing that I want to be okay with. It's so frustrating cognitively being okay with something but your traumas won't allow you to be. I believe I THINK securely but my feelings and emotions are not secure. Idk if that makes sense. 

But anyway. I'm just ranting now. But if anyone has any tips on feeling more secure in a relationship that gives you no reason not to, please do share. Or advice on feeling like your head and heart are split, where your head is secure but your heart is insecure (thought Vs emotion). I just want to be able to relax in my relationship. I'm tired.

798,The end of my story,"Hi guys,

After more than one year since my bf (DA) and I (AP) started working on our relationship, we had to end it.
It got much much better for a while. And then back to typical APDA stuff. My heart is sad, but my brain and gut know this is for the better.

I don‘t know what you think, but I started to believe that AP can never truly be happy in a relationship with a DA. No matter how hard we work, there will always be some lingering AP feelings and thoughts and behaviour be left. A relationship with a DA can never be as fulfilling as a relationship with someone secure. APs will always have to accept some kind of behaviour that hurts them. Because in the end, APs and DAs are just not compatible. That’s that.

The worst for me right now is looking back and seeing how much time I wasted chasing and begging and being anxious and just being miserable. But mostly, letting myself being treated like shit. 

Maybe that is just me talking because I am hurt so much right now. 

But there is also a part of me that is just relieved. Finally, no more false hope, no more suffering.

I will not react/act on assumptions.

That simple! The more I ask myself if I am reacting or acting on what my assumptions are vs. what I KNOW to be true, the more I am able to ignore the AP voice in my head. I.E. if I don't get a text back, instead of thinking ""I'm being ignored"" or ""they must be mad at me"", I remind myself ""they must be busy"" or ""they will text me back because they always do"".

801,Just broke up with my partner,"Heya! I've been lurking on this sub for a while now and it's really helped me out.

I broke up with my avoidant partner of two years yesterday because he wasn't meeting my needs and was triggering my anxious behaviour. It happened after months of me stating my needs, him saying he will do better, and me continuing to feel neglected. It's really chucked my brain in the blender and brought up some tough shit. 

 I feel so lost. I do not know how to stop worrying about him and if he's doing okay, or if I could have done or said the right thing to help him work through his childhood trauma and attachment patterns it would have worked and I just feel like I've failed. I'm at a loss about how to focus on myself in my grief and feelings of guilt and failure. I know that I was at my wits end, but for some reason I keep trying to convince myself that if I tried harder than it would have worked out. I keep wanting to message him and tell him I made a mistake, because the thought of moving into a world without him is scary and painful. But I know the pattern would repeat and I would remain miserable. 

I was wondering if anyone has any advice/tips/reading recommendations for dealing with an anxious brain, improving self worth and reshaping ideas of relationships to something secure. I've been in this situation before and I want to make sure it doesn't happen again. Honestly, even romance novels where couples are in equal and fulfilling relationships could help.

802,"Something I resonate so well, childhood traumas, dating emotionally unavailable men....","https://jennifersinparis.medium.com/i-quit-being-attracted-to-emotionally-unavailable-men-39f9da5e389e

That was a good read, I can so much resonate with the article. 

I have to say, my childhood was scary to say the least, constantly treading on egg shells. My parents, being tiger parents - my dad with expectations of what is deemed acceptable at school, nothing less than 80%. Otherwise, it's the spanking, no get together with friends, no TV, no games. It's terribly lonely. You kinda accepted it as a way of life. You are constantly scared that you are not achieving, because if you don't achieve, you are then not loved. 

If my parents were sitting in front of me right now, they will deny that I was not loved. They provided me with a roof with food hey? That's enough hey? I guess they loved me in their ways. My parents were there in my later life to bail me out, when the break up with my ex happened. But I guess I never really got the concept of healthy love. Guess my parents concept of love probably runs on the lines, of doing stuff for someone. 

I was bullied in school, I kept it to myself, not wanting to tell my parents. It was just terribly lonely. You spend alot of time doubting yourself, no one really telling you that you did a good job, no one ever telling you that you are loved. 

The longest relationship I had, was my ex of 6 years. Even he said I was a kind and giving person. I guess I also compromised alot. When he came along, I viewed him as someone to save me from a lonely childhood. The thing is, we started off as fling, him unable to commit, me wanting to fix him, me begging him to let's see where things go. He would degrade me, flirting and sleeping with other girls in front of me - and I stayed on. And I guess maybe our families had a part, when our lives got so intertwined, the next ""right"" step for us was to commit. He did think he was able to do it. But maybe he stayed on because he felt sorry for me? At the end, over the course of the break up, he told me, ""he didn't want a relationship in the first place"". 

 Thinking back on my ofher ""failed"" relationships... I guess those failed relationships were good at that subtle familiar feeling. - People first coming strong on you, you think you like them, and they like you, and then you (like a dog), would please them, presenting gifts asking for validation ... Then they ghost you, they say nothing is going to develop further. Yet the part of you goes, ""I can fix it, I can make myself into a version you like"". And yet, there are those people who tell you in your face, that they like you, they would so anything for you, and you don't feel anything. 

I am just unfortunately attracted to chaos. 

Now gradually becoming aware of the feelings. Gradually accepting the rejections. It's a terrible lonely feeling again. I just want someone to fill that void my ex left... Go holidays with me, go out and eat with me, me coming home and someone asking me how my day was, someone to make long term plans with. It's been a good week now, since my last casual daters faded on me, I accepted it I guess. I used to blame them for it, that they made no effort for me. The thing is, I am attracted to that feeling that they give me.",mepq2q,39,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/mepq2q/something_i_resonate_so_well_childhood_traumas/,AnxiousAttachment,1

For example, I feel pretty confident that when I’m dreading the thought of my partner ever wanting to do something without me, that is clearly coming out of being activated. Other stuff, though, can be less clear. A key example for me, as someone in a LDR, is expectations around how much we should be talking. Some insecure part of me thinks we should be talking on the phone an hour a day, which is not really a reasonable expectation for where we are in our relationship/how busy we are. On the other hand, I do know that I have a need that isn’t coming out of the anxiety to have some quality time with her every so often. However, I have a really hard time distinguishing what is me coming up with unobtainable needs out of an anxious state and needs that aren’t coming from that kind of place. That makes it really difficult for me to tell her “I need x, y, and z from you.” Anyone have thoughts on sorting that out?",mdh7jk,40,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/mdh7jk/actual_needs_versus_triggered_needs/,AnxiousAttachment,1

807,When is it them and when is it me?,"Hi fam! I'm pondering whether some low-grade attachment anxiety I am noticing is a reflection of the other party (and how parts of me react to their cues), or if this is a me thing (or...if it could be both).

I've been casually dating and playing the field for, oh, several months now. I'm having a great time lately. I go on LOTS of first dates, and I've been having fun with it! Feeling free, stable, secure, independent, and unattached. I rarely have sex, and that makes it easier to manage my predisposition towards attachment anxiety.

No one I've been talking to has really brought up any fears or feelings of vulnerability until I reconnected with a past acquaintance. He and I had a one-night stand a couple years ago. For context, it might have been the best sex of my life. The timing never worked out for us, but we recently connected and have hung out a couple times, without having sex again. 

There's...something happening for me around this connection. A very low-grade ominous feeling, and I don't know if it is fear of getting attached or intuition that he's not a safe person for me. All the evidence I am gathering about him as a person are green lights to proceed--he's commitment prone and looking for real connection.

I don't know if I'm scared because I could see myself getting attached, or if my attachment anxiety is stirred up by something about him. I can already see the slightest bit of evidence in my texting anxiety. Normally, I forget who texted who, but with him I am aware when I'm waiting for a text back. It's a very lowgrade, manageable preoccupation but noticeable.

I would like to know any thoughts or experiences on evaluating if a new connection is good for you. I would rather cut this guy off than get attached to someone who activates me!",14umwpu,37,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/14umwpu/when_is_it_them_and_when_is_it_me/,AnxiousAttachment,1
808,Lack of sex/intimacy triggering negative core beliefs,"I think this qualifies as anxious attachment advice, but if it is better suited for the relationship advice thread, please let me know so that I can move it there. I also am not going to be describing any sexual acts but will just be mentioning the frequency of sex, so I do not intend for this to be nsfw and have not marked it with the nsfw flair. If this should be changed, please let me know.

My (25 NB) girlfriend (28F) and I have been dating for a little over a year. Because of some sexual trauma on my side, we waited to have sex for the first time until 8 months of dating. This was about 7 months ago — in that time, we have averaged having sex about once or twice a month, but there were lots of external circumstances (illness, me getting cold sores, visiting home for a couple weeks, etc). Basically, the infrequency of our sexual interactions has always made me a little self-conscious, but I was able to attribute it to other things. But for the past couple of months she has completely lost interest in sex. She says she’s not sure what’s happened/changed besides the fact that she’s experiencing more body pain because of work (she does a lot of heavy lifting), hasn’t been eating or sleeping well, and has been stressed.

Which brings me to my question related to anxious attachment style. Her lack of interest in sex has really triggered my core beliefs that I’m not desirable and that she’s not into me, and my Relationship OCD (which basically means you fixate on problems in your relationship and are constantly looking for signs your relationship won’t work out). There is no telling how long this shift in her libido will last, but since she hasn’t been into kissing much either, I get in these negative spirals of not feeling wanted or desired. I can’t tell her about this because I know it would make her feel insecure, and because I don’t want to pressure her into sex, so I kind of just have to deal with this on my own.

What are ways/visualizations/techniques to cope with dry spells and feeling unwanted or undesired? My typical go-to lately has been Ideal Parent Figure for other issues, but it feels really weird imagining child me complaining about sex, lol. And how can I meet this need for closeness, either by myself or with her, in other ways?

810,"Do i get better at this by dating, or not dating?","about 10 days ago I ended things with someone who wasn’t right for me. Our dating lasted about 3 months. Now I’m abit lost on when/whether I should get out there again.

Here’s the dilemma:

* When I am dating I get anxious (for the many reasons we are familiar with as AAs). Maybe it’s the people I choose, or maybe it’s my lack of self-soothing skills. I think it’s both.


* When i was NOT dating I was actually kinda happy, but it’s an illusion: I was actually working on myself while expecting that the work would lead me to a relationship (e.g. “Lemme get off the apps for these few months and go to the gym, if i have a hotter body then I will be more successful at dating!”). I realise my mind was still preoccupied with relationships even when I was alone. The fantasy that if I got “better” I would be more “worthy” of a relationship was the reason I wasn’t miserable. When i got back out there I was still an anxious mess. Bear in mind at this time of my life I hadn’t learned of attachment theory yet.

Now how do i get better at this? By putting myself out there (and learning to manage the anxiety), or do i have to cut off dating completely and work on myself in some meaningful way first? I started therapy this year, and am much more aware of my AA (i wasnt even aware of attachment theory 4 months ago), but I wanna hear opinions from you folks!

7 month relationship, I’d say we’re both working towards secure but not there yet - he’s DA. I haven’t heard from him since Wednesday which is a long ass time for us AP’s as you know. I sent a text Thursday night & this morning.. no response. I called this morning ~ found out he put his phone on DND (never does this unless he’s with me) but called again the second time.. no answer. Sent a 2 min voice note kindly explaining my anxiety & just to let me know if he’s ok (this was at noon).. no response! 

I’ve cried, I’ve ruminated for a little bit… ofc it will take a LOT to change that but I am sitting here with a glass of wine & a book smiling and I actually feel at peace. Because the way I see it: either he ghosts me (ew painful!) but that shows me that he could never be my husband so talk about redirection being a blessing! And if he doesn’t ghost me.. I will make contact & it will give me the opportunity to set some REAL boundaries on why not hearing from him doesn’t work for me! I will say.. my intuition is telling me something is really wrong in his life for him to do this (or he’s ghosting) but as us AP’s know.. logic doesn’t really matter when we feel abandonment. 

I share this to say… progress isn’t linear. Just because you cry or freak out doesn’t mean you’re not healing… the question is: can you move through these feelings and not let it take you away from your life? As I am sitting here: I remember that it was ok to ruminate today but tonight can I pour love into me? His actions show me how DYSFUNCTIONAL his relationships used to be…. They do not reflect my worth or my future… only I decide that!

My ex bf just dumped me a second time; first time we were together for six years living together, we were single for six months and re-dated for six months. 
He admitted that even when we were living together he didn’t allow himself to fully commit and didn’t understand why. A month ago he was crying telling me how he doesn’t understand why he sometimes has these detachment episodes when he threatens to break up, that I am the love of his life and he wants children with me. A week ago he apologized for never defending me and always talking bad about me and for the first time ever started defending me towards his family who disapproved of me, he said he’d never let me go again. 
One week later, he’s out with friends and says he’s lost all feelings for me because he had a great weekend with friends where he didn’t miss me and he was just lonely when I reached out to him six months ago and his feelings have been a roller coaster with much love and no love at all and now it’s now and it cannot go back up, he seeks happiness elsewhere and sees no future with me. Is this being avoidant? How can someone lose such deep feelings during one week? Do you think this is detachment and will he ever process this loss and regret it? I am no longer looking for any chances but I’d like to know if he’ll realize he’s lost someone who gave him the world and regret it.",vuj7yl,39,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vuj7yl/were_you_ever_dumped_twice_by_the_same_avoidant_ex/,AnxiousAttachment,1
820,I feel like I’m walking on eggshells trying not to trigger my deactivating DA partner to further deactivate and leave.,"Knowing that she’s been feeling doubts about our relationship and entering the disinterested/trapped/desire-to-flee stage leaves me frequently anxious that I’m going to trigger her further with my activating. I just want so badly to ask her for some form of reassurance. I want to be communicating as much as possible about our relationship and working together to fix it. But I alternatively do not want to be overwhelming, and I want to give her the time and space to work through her issues. I feel like at this point I’m just subsisting on crumbs; a crumb when she and I talk on the phone about our days, a crumb when she says “I love you”, crumbs when we spend time together, when we hug or hold hands, a crumb when she tells me she started reading something I recommended about attachment theory. I’m not sure how long I can take only being given tiny slivers of hope about our relationship though. I just hate being in this weird limbo stage. I hate the uncertainty. I wish I could feel more secure, and I’m trying to self-soothe when I’m giving her space, but I slip back into this familiar anxiety sometimes. Being distanced is making me realize daily how deeply I love her and desire a future together, and I’m so fearful the opposite is happening for her. I guess I just needed to vent, get this out of my head so I could maybe fall asleep.",uefwgp,37,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/uefwgp/i_feel_like_im_walking_on_eggshells_trying_not_to/,AnxiousAttachment,1

No this doesn't mean that you need someone to fix you or etc, it just means your mindset and attachment is normal human behavior.

824,Im Half Secured and Half Anxious (Here are some lessons I learned) Thread,"Hey, this is like a journal entry for me, but I wanna share it with ya'll. Hoping some of my points help you out.

\- Learn to not feel insecure or ""beggy"" when you have a complaint about your SO or relationship.(This is your relationship as well) The moment I learned that if I bring up something in the perspective that this is affecting ""us"" but not ""me"" changes your mindset.

&#x200B;

\- Realize that you won't die or be hopeless without your SO, if you feel like you would be in a bad position if you break up right now.... you need to truly re-evaluate yourself and find out what your missing in your personal life and why you would feel helpless without your SO

&#x200B;

\- Learn to accept your SO for who they are. The moment you sort of know-how your SO is....you are either going to have to accept them for who they are or leave. At the end of the day, you cant change someone. You can never fix an avoidant personality person, they have to do that on their own. If they have traits you truly don't like, there's no point in staying with them

&#x200B;

\- Seriously, occupy yourself with stuff to do. I currently do digital art, and create digital models for client work on the side. I also play a game where you can watch movies with random strangers online. I am filling my space up with digital friends, this allows me to give my SO some space, because I am enjoying my own time. Do whatever you need to do to find more time for yourself.

&#x200B;

\- Do your ""dress up"" routine even if you are not going out. Sometimes simply getting ready and putting on your makeup or doing extra steps in your skincare routine makes you feel really good. Sometimes I do this, and I feel so good that day, and I don't need to rely on my SO to tell me that I look good. I KNOW I LOOK GOOD TODAY :)

&#x200B;

\- This might sound avoidant but, learn to not like compliments. Sounds weird right? I know, but hear me out. I am not telling you to hate when someone compliments you. Just treat compliments as a neutral response. You relying on someone to compliment you is giving that person too much power over your own self-esteem. How you feel while no one is around is how you should feel at all times. Regardless of what you're SO thinks of you. (This tip helped me to not really care anymore if my partner forgets to acknowledge my appearance, or throws out a random compliment) It doesn't bother me anymore, I rely on myself to feel good.

&#x200B;

\- When your partner is not giving you the attention you need, realize that its truly their loss. Don't sulk and think your such a needy person. Because you are not, you are just someone that is overly affectionate and loves to let your SO know that you love them. Think of yourself highly, and know that you deserve a quality person. Do not be afraid to let people go if they are not meeting your expectations.(DISCLAIMER: THIS IS IF YOU ARE NOT HAVING ANXIOUS THOUGHTS)

&#x200B;

\- Learn to distinguish the difference between anxious expectations and regular relationship expectations. Anxious expectations usually come in very intrusively and are usually unreasonable. Anxious expectations usually disappear when you are in a good mood or feel stable.  A real relationship expectation is when something that your SO does still bothers you even when your in a happy and stable mood. (That's how I distinguish it)

An example:

I had a time where I was lowkey complaining that my girlfriend was not as kinky as me and that I have to bring up all the kinks, and therefore that means I care about sex more than her. I took a step back and thought, and realized that I was so stupid. She was open to kinks, she just needed someone to guide her. Just because I am the one initiating it more does not mean doesn't like sex as much as me.

&#x200B;

I will probably do a part 2, I can keep going, but feel free to keep adding to my list!",lm6os0,41,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/lm6os0/im_half_secured_and_half_anxious_here_are_some/,AnxiousAttachment,1
825,"I'm not afraid to be alone, I'm afraid to be wrong","It's common knowledge that AA people are afraid to be alone and that's why we end up staying so long in relationships that aren't good for us. While I know and understand this may be true for most of us on this sub, I'm not sure if it's really true for myself.

The times I was single I wasn't unhappy. I had no issue being single per say. I was very open to meeting people but I wasn't upset that I wasn't in a relationship. And as I draw closer to executing my decision to end my relationship, my fear isn't even being single. I know for a fact that will be fine, if not better, single. The thing that is stopping me from leaving is fear that I might be wrong or that my anxiety is overpowering my better judgement. What if I just need to hold on a little longer? What if I just haven't been effective enough in my communication? I'm also afraid of the pain. The pain of letting him go. I love him and it breaks my heart that theres nothing I can do to show him that. He's so afraid of love and committment and it is such a shame because we could have worked well together - when things are great, they're great. And we click on such a deep level but every time I try to get just a little closer, he pushes me away and withdraws and all progress is lost. One step forward and three steps back.

I hope I'm explaining it clearly. I'm really not worried about being single but I just dont want any regrets. Or maybe its just my anxiety talking hahaha",l8kd5j,39,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/l8kd5j/im_not_afraid_to_be_alone_im_afraid_to_be_wrong/,AnxiousAttachment,1
826,Taylor Swift anxiously attached?,"During therapy, I’ve been introduced to attachment theory and feel pretty strongly that I’m anxious/preoccupied. I finished Attached yesterday, and it was very painful and informative to look back at my past relationships. Now regarding TSwift. I’ve always loved Taylor Swift and it’s wild to me how many of her songs are literally taken from my thoughts/attachment theory. Delicate is literally about that beginning feeling of relationship fragility. hoax verbatim says “my smoking gun”!! tolerate it 100% sounds like an anxious-avoidant relationship “I notice everything you do or don’t do”. Ugh. There’s so much more but I’m wondering if anyone else has thought about this or if I’m just projecting.",l0r8mq,40,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/l0r8mq/taylor_swift_anxiously_attached/,AnxiousAttachment,1
827,anxious attachment or fearful avoidant?,"I will really appreciate it if someone could help me identify my attachment style. since I found out about the theory, I had no doubt I was anxious, but I'm starting to think I might actually be fearful avoidant.

I have a lot of anxious tendencies - I feel incomplete without a partner, need a ton of reassurance and validation, always worry that I'm not liked enough, a very minor thing can make me feel unloved. Fearful avoidants seem to have all these things, but also they fear being hurt by the closeness, find it hard to trust people, and they push them away.

I don't consciously push people away, but, as much as I crave a relationship and become attached quickly, it's also hard for me to commit to one as I fear being hurt. No matter how much reassurance I get, I'm always suspicious that: it's all a trick, the person doesn't REALLY like me, or that they'll turn out to be abusive, or that they're playing with me. A big suspicion of mine is that someone just uses me for my body and doesn't like me for me.

And as much as I get hurt and feel unloved when my partner wants his space (as much as I realize it's irrational), sometimes I also stop myself from wanting to spend all my time with him bc then we're gonna get sick of each other and ruin everything. I guess I have this belief that everything will go bad at some point anyway. But I DON'T push people away, I get into relationships more than I don't. I also tend to pick up fights or burst into tears when I'm triggered instead of communicating vulnerably, maybe that's me pushing people away.

Can you anxious folks get this way? A lot of articles mention that anxious can also be less trusting. Maybe that's just my belief that I'm not worthy of love, and I'm just anxious, or maybe I'm more anxious than I am avoidant? Or does it seem more like fearful avoidant to you guys?

Looking forward to any insights. Hope you guys find your healing soon!",g9nzez,39,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/g9nzez/anxious_attachment_or_fearful_avoidant/,AnxiousAttachment,1

829,The “universe” gave me a sign yesterday,"I feel like I’ve been posting here way too often so I apologize lol. This is my journal at this point 😅 But anyway, something very strange happened to me yesterday that made me feel like everything I’m going through is exactly what needed to happen. 

I went to the store to grab a few things and then randomly decided to go for a walk after I got back. I noticed a group of 3 people around my age hanging out near their apartment and felt drawn to them for some reason, but I started feeling pretty emotional and ended up going to my favorite spot at this playground near my place. I sat on the tire swing for a while and then that same group of people showed up. I almost left but felt like something was telling me to stay. Then the one girl in the group said hi and started talking to me, asking why i was there alone, etc. I opened up and it started a whole conversation about life, addiction, relationships, and what we were both struggling with. 

She told me she was drunk and that normally she would never approach a stranger, but that she felt a reason to talk to me. She was very sweet and even complimented me a few times. After it got dark we both said we were glad we met, i gave her some encouragement about the things she was dealing with. Then we parted ways. 

Throughout my life I’ve noticed things like this seem to happen to me when I’m going through something painful and life-changing. I could never predict it or expect it. But every time, it feels like the universe or something is telling me I’m exactly where I need to be. What makes me even more convinced is that I haven’t talked to a single person in the neighborhood since moving here in march, besides saying hi to people in my building. I also had a gut feeling about this weekend regarding a shift in my situation with the person who is now ghosting me, so my intuition was right. However, I never could have guessed that I’d also have a meaningful conversation with someone I’ll likely never see again.

So I guess all of this to say that life really hurts, but it has a way of reminding you that you’re on the right path. My “relationship” came at exactly the right time to teach me things about myself that I had been repressing/avoiding for years. It also helped me pull myself out of a really deep depression by showing me that I *can* experience love (even if it doesn’t last as long as I’d like) but that my worth and purpose have always been inside myself, not in my relationships. It showed me who I am, what I want, and has given me hope for the day I finally meet the person I’m meant to be with 💗",16m1nce,38,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/16m1nce/the_universe_gave_me_a_sign_yesterday/,AnxiousAttachment,1

831,Need help with making my relationship with my anxious attachment style partner better.,"My girlfriend has an anxious attachment style, while I am pretty secure in my attachment style. I believe that people should be trusted completely until they give you a solid reason not to, and hence, I trust her completely which means that I don't worry about her actions and assign them the best of intentions. She's been pretty open about the fact that she'll never be able to trust me completely (doesn't help that she's also been cheated on in the past, which makes it even more difficult for her). I've been alright with that, given that things have improved in the past year that we have been together although it does bother me at times when she says that she'll never be able to trust me completely.

I've always been honest and never lied to her about anything and I have tried my best to reassure her whenever she has needed it. I've told her multiple times that I want to build a future with you, that she's the best relationship I have ever had in my life. 


Anyway, my question here is - how do I not take things, where she's not able to trust me, personally? How do I stop taking it as a judgement of my character (I hope it is not)? Is this normal for someone who has an anxious attachment style? What else can I do to make it easier for her, other than being honest and transparent with her as much as possible?

I was just dropping this little hack in case anyone was interested in doing it. He gets his reassurance and I don’t feel pressure to be available at work. Not that he’s ever pressured me.

839,Please help me reframe the breadcrumbing from my DA ex.,"To start, I’ve had two back to back dreams about my ex the last few nights and they just bring all of the hurt back up.

I am almost five months out of a breakup with my DA ex. I miss and still love them very much, and I’m doing my best.

A friend of mine (who also identifies as avoidant) pointed out that my ex made the decision to break up, but I’ve been the person responsible for carrying that decision forward and my mind has been blown for 24 hours. 

I couldn’t figure out why I’ve felt so guilty and even wholly responsible for this relationship ending when that’s not what I wanted. And I now realize it’s because I’ve been doing the breaking up. 

My ex has broken up with me twice now after deactivating, and I’ve been beating myself up about this most recent time. More specifically, I’ve been telling myself that I failed the relationship, or that I am the one responsible for letting something end that I didn’t want to end, because I didn’t respond to their breadcrumb. 

(typing this “out loud” feels searingly humiliating, but I need to share this because I need help reframing this. Please don’t judge me.)

They broke up with me and breadcrumbed me shortly afterwards.

The bread crumbing has mind-fucked me for months. They indirectly insinuated that they were going to come back after some time (through a song on Spotify. This has also been humiliating for me to explain.) At first I felt hopeful, and over time I felt more and more angry. This is what I mean by I’ve been doing the breaking up: I’ve carried forward and have been implementing boundaries-because I want/need/deserve direct communication. 

I've been beating myself up because upon implementing those boundaries, they have withdrawn more. Instead of remembering that this person broke up with me (absolutely blindsided), I’ve been carrying all of the fault and feeling like I missed my chance. I fucked this up. I could’ve “had” them or saved this if I had just reached out. 

I am really moving on faith right now (and self love.) I know that I made the decision to set boundaries specifically because I don’t want anything less than direct communication. I want healthy relationships, I’m willing to build them, but not all by myself. I can’t be the only initiator for repair in this relationship, especially after I’ve been hurt. 

Please, please help me reframe the bread crumbs. I’m over here feeling like it’s my fault that I lost the love of my life ON TOP OF NOT WANTING TOO.",xncspz,38,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/xncspz/please_help_me_reframe_the_breadcrumbing_from_my/,AnxiousAttachment,1

842,It's very frustrating how tech can exacerbate anxiety/anxious attachment,"From my perspective, ignorance is bliss. Back then before all the social media, if you were anxiously attached all you could do is think about what the other person is doing but have no proof or signs that they're doing anything

As of today, there's so much stuff that can be used to try to regulate anxiety but in the most maladaptive ways. WHY are text receipts even a thing?? I don't want to know that I'm being ignored. Being left on read HURTS. Seeing the little ""active"" sign on Facebook or other apps HURTS. 

The worst of all imo is Snapchat with snapscore. Nothing like knowing your partner isn't just ignoring you, but they're *sending pictures to someone else you have no clue what those pics are or who they're sending them too*

That is why in my next relationship, I'm not allowing social media in it (for myself that is). I won't be adding any future partners on any social media (I only use it to talk in groups for my interests anyway. I don't post myself or want anyone else to post pictures of me or talk about me). 

I only want them to have my *number*. So that way I have nothing to focus on. I hate feeling on edge, seeing their online activities and getting upset about it.

Then on the flip side, I don't like it when people end up accusing me of ignoring them when I'm not. I've had people tell me they know I was online when I was only quickly glancing to see who messaged me and then getting back off because I was busy.

844,I want to date someone like me,"First post on Reddit. I feel desperate. I’m tired of always being the one who puts more effort into the relationship. My psychologist told me I had anxious attachment style and it makes sense. I’ve had four relationships and it has always been this way. A month ago my ex broke up with me because he didn’t want a relationship anymore. He started texting me online. Immediately told me I was pretty and we started dating a month after chatting daily. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to marry me, that he knew I was the one. Not long after that, he started being distant and rude towards me. I always give myself completely. I showered him with affection, payed for dates, bought him presents, tried to not complain, started playing FFXIV with him (which he loves) and agreed to only meet whenever he wanted to. Asked him if anything I did bothered him, but he said he liked me being so affectionate. He still dumped me. I asked him “why did you say you would devote yourself to me if you didn’t love me?” His response: “ I guess I shouldn’t promise things when I’m horny lol.” I was heartbroken. We are still texting each other, and he gives me mixed signs constantly. I confronted him about this and he said that he’ll stop, but it made me happy when he did because I thought he wanted me back. He calls me baby and says I’m beautiful , but says it doesn’t mean anything. I want someone who loves me as much as I love him. Someone who is not only interested in hooking up and leaving. I want someone to treat me the way I treat him. I want someone who is not afraid to show a lot of affection and who makes me feel secure. I post art online and my boyfriends always ignore it, I always wanted them to like it or comment on it. I want to go on dates to theme parks and play video games together. I want to date someone who will be my best friend.

845,hypervigilance is a b*tch,"Being FA is the worst. I focus on patterns too much, and the *smallest* change will send me into a frenzy

I spiraled because someone I talk to regularly *used more exclamation points than usual*. Like wtf is this. Come on. This person usually is monotone while texting. It didn't help that they've been more distant lately but I should know by now it's because they WORK VERY LONG HOURS and they study a lot!!

Why am I spiraling over fucking exclamation points? I am so mad at myself 🤦🏾‍♀️. Now I'm embarrassed because I spammed them, deleted the texts, and now I feel myself getting ready to withdraw because I feel stupid.

846,The danger of loneliness,"On the Scams sub, you can find plenty of stories about lonely middle-aged or old ladies who fall head over heels for a ghost they've never met just because this person starts paying attention to them, texting regularly and being nice. They cling to something as small as regular texts like their life depends on it and fall insanely in love with this insignificant smidgen of attention. They dive in headfirst and will believe anything and angrily defy all logic so they can keep believing the illusion of being loved.

They deserve compassion because this is a testament to how desperately lonely they are, how empty and meaningless their lives must feel if tiny breadcrumbs of attention from a fantasy man become instantly the only thing they live for.

I realised today that it's no different from the many posts on this sub that boil down to ""a stranger texted me for a week being nice and now my entire life, self esteem and social life revolves around getting a couple of texts a day from someone I've never met, I'm desperately clinging to it because if I lose that I'll be devastated and life will have no meaning anymore"".

I've been there. In times when I was lonely, lost in life, without a purpose or loved ones around, and with low self esteem. It inevitably ended how you can imagine - it didn't work out because I was clinging to a fantasy and I was unreasonably devastated because I was projecting all kinds of deep-seated issues on the situation. Hoping that if it worked out I would be ""fixed"" when of course that wasn't true at all. 

I'm sure you can all see clearly how tragically sad it is, and how dangerous it can become.

So if you find yourself in that situation, please realise that it's not only making you suffer but it's putting you in very real danger, and that it's of the utmost importance and urgency to work on fixing your loneliness and low self esteem by yourself (preferably before you engage with other people). We've all been in that situation at some point. Waiting for a romantic partner or random stranger to appear out of nowhere and magically give meaning and purpose to our life is a recipe for disaster.",vmm2tq,38,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vmm2tq/the_danger_of_loneliness/,AnxiousAttachment,1
847,Let's talk about DAs pre-deactivation,"I was talking with my therapist about why anxious and avoidant types end up together so much. She dropped the cliche line on me that ""Anxious types feel like they need to work or suffer for love,"" and I immediately disagreed with her, saying that in the honeymoon phase of a relationship, avoidants can be perfectly sensitive and generous and don't make their partners work for love. I've seen people in this sub echo the same sentiment; that their DA partners and exes seemed totally fine until they began to deactivate.

Since then I've been trying to look for explanations as to why APs and DAs get involved with each other so often. I don't think any one explanation tells the whole story, but I'm pretty sure bits and pieces of it are accurate. What I'm most interested in are certain tells that a DA may have BEFORE they deactivate; so much discourse is about their deactivation that I feel there are other dimensions of avoidant attachment that are overlooked.

I'd really like to hear people try and come up with answers on their own before my input potentially biases the responses I get. Please at least try to draft a response before reading further.

* The most often explanation I hear is that the dating pool is oversaturated with insecure types because relationships among secure types last longer.
* DAs are more independent and will seek out activities to do on their own. APs are more focused on people and relationships, so when two APs are focused on each other, the lack of activities together may cause the relationship to fizzle. Two DAs may also fizzle because they're more concerned with their own individual hobbies than each other. Conversely, an AP can ""lose themselves"" in a DA by joining them and piggybacking off of their hobbies. This is nice and easy for the DA as it also allows them to continue engaging in whatever hobbies they were already pursuing without sacrificing their independence.
* DAs often enjoy the novelty in a relationship. A secure person may take their time opening up in a relationship, but an AP will give a lot really fast. Secure types may be as exciting, because building a relationship with them requires a greater level of delayed gratification.
* An almost identical issue can occur when APs date an SA. A secure person may want to take things too slowly for an AP. Surprisingly, DAs are often really bad at setting boundaries and the desire for novelty and/or lack of emotional attunement can lead to them giving too much of themselves in early stages of a relationship. In this sense they may themselves be facilitating a level of closeness that causes them to deactivate, while a secure person may be more aware of their boundaries and state them up front. This is a super contentious point (it really does seem contradictory) but I've noticed it in all three of the DAs I've been involved with, and some people on this sub have parroted similar experiences.",vbriw4,37,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/vbriw4/lets_talk_about_das_predeactivation/,AnxiousAttachment,1

1. I am done harboring anger and resentment towards my avoidant/narcissistic exes, and my parents for their lack of emotional attunement and availability as a child
2. I am choosing forgiveness and acceptance
3. I will heal my CPTSD
4. I will heal my abandonment wounds
5. I will heal my codependency
6. I will heal my own narcissistic traits
7. I will stop holding grudges
8. I will educate myself about self-compassion, self-esteem, and self-love (apparently I need a lot of these 3)
9. I am done shaming and blaming myself
10. I am done blaming my parents for my trauma
11. I am done being codependent on my therapist and sister
12. I will learn how to self-soothe
13. I will find happiness and peace in solitude
14. I will get right with god and Jesus again. I am asking God to help me release this pain.
15. I will stop chasing emotionally unavailable people
16. I will stop ""escaping"" from my emotions and issues with addictions (alcohol, pornography, soothing through others)
17. I will stop checking her social media
18. I will stop demonizing others for my own suffering
19. I will practice forgiveness every day
20. I will take care of myself to the best of my abilities (eating healthy, working out, reading, praying, grooming)

  
I am so done being this insecure, angry, sad, depressed, anxious, hypervigilant, fearful man. I am finally taking accountability. I'm choosing to forgive my past, and those who have wronged me. I am choosing to forgive the injustices of being the way I am from things outside of my control. I am choosing the path that's hard... The one where I have to learn how to love myself. I'm done using other people to try and feel good about myself (their validation, their approval).

851,There's nothing wrong with dating with intention,"Some comments to the recent post about recognizing avoidant attachment traits in potential partners got me thinking. And I know this makes me sound old, but I'm at an age where I'm no lonter interested in flings and casual relationships.

There's a perspective according to which it's bad and 'not secure' to want to be selective when it comes to potential partners, or that it's some kind of attack on the potential partner's character, but I strongly disagree. On the contrary: I think it's absolutely secure to date with intention, being clear on what you want and what you're looking for in a relationship, and screening out partners that are not a match.

**It's not personal**. It doesn't mean 'I don't want insecure partners because they're bad / unlovable / evil'. My DA ex was a lovely, kind person and I loved him dearly, and he treated me well and cared for me. But none of that was enough to compensate for the **fundamental incompatibility** in terms of emotional availability and interest in emotional and practical commitment, so a relationship between us just couldn't work.

There are many great people who are incompatible for eminently practical reasons, and this is a fundamental one when it comes to romantic relationships. To me it's a deal-breaker, so it might as well come to light as soon as possible.

There are no absolutes 'right or wrong'. There's only what you want and what they want, and both things are valid, but they need to match. Kind of like, if you are absolutely sure you want children, you might want to screen out as soon as possible partners who are very adamant that they don't. It doesn't mean they're a bad person or you're a bad person for wanting different things. It's not personal. It's just a fundamental incompatibility between you two and both might be better off finding a more suitable partner.

In an ideal world, everyone would be clear and straightforward from the get-go about their emotional status and their intentions about commitment, but since that's not the case, we might have to find ways to figure it out without being told outright. Even more when someone comes on strong at first / lovebombs only to do a total about-face after months have been invested. Already the lack of clarity and inability to be straightforward, even if it doesn't stem from outright deceit, would be a deal-breaker for me at my age.

There's nothing wrong with being clear on your intentions and wishes when it comes to relationships and not wanting to invest months on a partner only to then be blindsided when the fundamental incompatibility finally does come to light.

Granted, maybe a secure person will automatically pick up on the incompatibility and move on without the need for bullet points and specific clues to look for. But if someone  isn't at that point yet there's no shame in needing pointers and some guidance in identifying potential deal-breakers.

I actually think this is a very secure approach, as opposed to clinging on no matter what to any shred of connection with anyone, without any thought to long-term compatibility, either squashing your fundamental needs or hoping they will one day change theirs. 

There's nothing wrong with being clear and honest about what you want and searching for a partner that wants the same. It's not about 'finding a perfect partner', it's about finding someone who's compatible with you, which is imho a necessary foundation for a relationship.",sd2wd6,38,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/sd2wd6/theres_nothing_wrong_with_dating_with_intention/,AnxiousAttachment,1

856,Difference between dating a Secure vs DA style partners,"So I started dating my new bf (he has secure attachment style) around 3 months back. Before him I was in a relationship with someone with a DA attachment for 4 years and its like a difference of night and day, ngl. Although I have been dating the new guy for 3 months only, the level of comfort and closeness I feel with him, it was never present with my ex. I remember when I started dating my new bf, it was 2 weeks in and he had promised me that we will leave together (we work in different companies on the same campus). So after the proposed time came and passed my anxiety suddenly flared up and instead of calling him like any normal person I (to my great shame) found myself in the reception area of my new bf's office. They called him and he came down and saw me and then he suddenly remembered. He apologized, asked me to wait 10 minutes so that he can get his stuff form upstairs. Anyways he came down and we left in his car, and I was completely prepared for him to be passive aggressive or even angry(like my ex would have done) but nothing. He apologized and said he had completely forgotten about our program and asked why didnt I call him? I mumbled something, he smiled and thats it. No shaming or being passive aggressive with me, no reminding me of it every 30 minutes, no silent treatment, no games nothing. He just got over it. Another incident where I can remember the difference was when I sometimes messaged my ex during lunch time asking if he had lunch, what did he have, did he enjoy it and he used to say to me that I was being needy and clingy and I need to stop making him feel imprisoned while he was working (all because I sent a couple of messages). With my new bf when I told him at the start that I would like to sometimes message him during lunchtime, will it bother him? He responded with ""well we can have a 5 minute conversation if you dont mind) and now we have  5-10 minutes conversations during lunch time and if he is busy he will inform me beforehand. I have never felt so loved and supported in a long time. Its really like night and day. Now I can go a whole day without messaging him and not get triggered because I know once he gets an opportunity he will message me, because he likes it. So my anxiety has somewhat sated, and its an amazing feeling tbh.

Sorry for the long post, I am just feeling happy right now and wanted to share it with you guys. Thanks for reading!",qeywtk,39,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/qeywtk/difference_between_dating_a_secure_vs_da_style/,AnxiousAttachment,1
857,"Have you ever realized that you have had needs or expectations, stemming from your attachment style, that were unrealistic or unhealthy for a secure relationship? What are those expectations?","Everyone has different needs and expectations in a relationship. Everyone deserves to have those needs and expectations met. However, have you ever realized that you might have had unrealistic or even unhealthy needs/expectations for a secure relationship? Especially any need or expectation that can stem from an anxious attachment. Have you had unrealistic levels of a certain need? For example, expecting your partner to communicate ""too"" often when a more realistic and healthy level of that need would be a lower level of communication. We all deserve to have our expectation/needs met but have you ever realized that you have had expectations/needs that was hard or even impossible for a partner to meet?

I know that it can seem that the intention of this post is to put anxious people in a bad light but that is not my intention. I am not in any way trying to say that anxious attached people are expecting too much from a relationship but the truth is that anyone can have unrealistic expectations from a partner, regardless of their attachment style. I think everyone could benefit from reading about needs/expectations that others find unrealistic or even unhealthy about themselves since we might be able to relate to ourselves. The first step to be able to better yourself is to know what needs to be improved.

858,Overly dependent on male validation.,"I realized today that a lot of my anxious attachment in romantic relationships stem from an over reliance on male validation. I think this came from my experiences with being bullied by guys in elementary/middle school. I had a pretty bad ugly duckling phase and believed myself to be undesirable. Male attention always alluded me through grade school, and for a while it seemed that this would be forever out of my grasp.

I started getting attention from my looks from men in a positive way when I was in college, and I almost lived for this form of validation in a really unhealthy way. My self esteem was still absolute trash, so I attracted a narcissist and was stuck in an abusive relationship for a year that further destroyed my self worth.

As an adult, I feel like I don't really have a lot of sources of self validation because I feel like I procrastinate so much that I can never make progress on my hobbies, career, etc. I also lived at my parents house until basically now (I'm 28) and they really pampered me, so I feel like I don't know how to be an adult or trust myself to take care of myself. This makes me feel really worthless and bad about myself.

I dated two guys this summer, and it was valuable in the sense that I finally realized my DA ex was not this earth shatteringly deep connection I thought it was because I found other guys that I could have a deep connection with also. However, I was definitely dependent on their attention and presence in my life to feel happy and secure in my self. It's almost like I feel like I can be the person I want to be/aspire to be when observing myself through their eyes.

It's like, I become another person with male attention even if it's from a guy I don't really care that much for. I am more energetic, peppy, I laugh more, am able to focus on other parts of my life more. Without the male attention I feel like some of my life force is sucked away; I feel anxious, nervous, and scared. I feel alone, even if the guy at the moment is just someone I'm messaging on a dating app and we've never met.

I really want to fix that in myself because I'm not happy or healthy in romantic partnerships for the right reasons, and I get way too devastated when a guy ends things with me even if I haven't known him for long or if I didn't really like him that much to begin with.

I think that moving out of my parents house this fall, starting graduate school, and giving myself the opportunity to come into my own will give me some more avenues to validate myself and not rely on men. I don't know how things will pan out, but I guess it's a start.

862,Finally Healing.,"Had an important breakthrough in therapy today that the goal in healing anxious attachment is not the elimination of anxiety, but to actually be able to recognize it apart from myself and to not allow it to have an effect my self worth. I've been working on self awareness, self esteem, and attachment issues for close to a year now so I'm incredibly proud of the progress I've made. It took forever to be able to live consciously and to calmly accept my feelings no matter which way they go. I'm hoping that this wisdom is helpful to some one currently going through this too.

For context, I've been curious about some anxiety I am feeling because my ex and I started talking again but I have no romantic interest in him. Hes leaving my country for good so we are only catching up before he makes the big move. Hes horrible at communicating in a timely way that I am accustomed to with close friends. And while I cerebrally acknowledge that this is the best he can do and that's just the way he is, I still felt anxious.

Fortunately I also recognize that this anxiety is not as bad as it used to be! I am curious about it now, able to let it pass while I self care. If it comes back it is not agony to me. I just kind of acknowledge it being there and am able to shift my attention to something else now.

863,I dated someone for years off and on. I ended it but can't seem to fully move on. What has been your experience and what has helped you?,"**TL;DR:** I am a 28F AP who dated a 34M DA for 3 years off and on. I recognize ending it was the right thing to do, but I am having an incredibly hard time accepting these attachment issues have had such a costly impact on my life. I'm in therapy but feel stuck and don't know how to move forward. Would love to hear personal stories, advice and ideas from other AP's who went through this.    



\------    



Hi! I (28F - AP) was in an anxious-avoidant relationship with a 34M (DA) for 3 years. I've lost track of how many times we broke up or who initiated each one (we'd take turns lol) but I finally ended things four months ago right before Easter. I pulled the trigger and was determined to stay the course this time for both our sakes.

What I am really struggling with is that even though the relationship was ""bad"" insofar as our attachment issues were concerned, he really was an amazing person that I had a strong connection with when things were good. I have never met anyone like him. He has so many qualities that I value; he is kind, successful, intelligent and so curious about life. He would often share his beautiful thoughts with me and was genuinely excited to hear mine too. We never lacked for conversation which is something I didn't have with other partners and always wanted. And, for a DA at least, he was fairly emotionally open and would share what he felt with me, good or bad, even crying a few times.

The trouble is when I needed more than that, particularly with deepening affection and reassurance about ""us"", he would often (but not always - *and this is important -* more on that below) deactivate and become exasperated that I had any emotional needs at all. When this happened, it made me feel abandoned by him and terrible about myself, like I was ruining everything because I asked for something as outrageous as spending a long weekend together or to become more integrated with my closest friends. It felt like merely having those needs was an imposition on him, let alone expressing them with an expectation to get them met through the relationship.

Adding to the confusion was that he occasionally wouldn't behave like this. Perhaps 1/3rd of the time he'd give me enough. In fact, the issue wasn't so much a total lack of emotional reciprocation as much as it was the inconsistency that drove my anxiety through the roof and kept the cycle going for years! I told my therapist the drip-feed of connection was worse than none at all. It was as if we were together on paper but not in daily existence. It didn't translate somehow and I couldn't put my finger on why; he wasn't overtly cold or doing anything wrong per se.

It felt like the relationship was everything I wanted under one impossible condition: that I be almost 100% emotionally self-sufficient. If I was doing okay, we were okay. But if I wasn't doing okay (and I often wasn't because of AP,  grad school, and, ya know, life), it felt like he couldn't deal with it and there was a tacit response of: ""those are your problems, not mine."" It was so painful and it made me so angry at him but again I couldn't identify what was objectively wrong! I would go into fits of anxiety and blame myself for imposing on him even though I knew my asks were reasonable. I even yelled a few times and broke up out of desperation but when my emotions would settle, I would second guess myself.

I also have to be honest and acknowledge my AP faults. I think it's common to paint DA's as self-absorbed monsters and AP's as hapless victims but I have to take accountability too. As usual, I moved way too fast, too soon right after we met. Less than a few week after our first date. He wanted to go slow and I ignored that if I'm being honest. Typical AP.  Also, I was unconsciously tasking him with solving my self-esteem & anxiety problem by loving me through an idealized relationship - ""saving"" me in a way - which, of course, is completely unrealistic. I wasn't happy with my life in general and I wanted him to make me happy in the relationship specifically to offset that.

So while it's true that he couldn't give me what's *reasonable*, I acknowledge I did damage by expecting him to give me what's *unreasonable* and protesting when it didn't happen. I did my part in driving him away and making him feel bad although I did not intend to. I feel immense guilt for that. But most of this was happening unconsciously. I think when the pressure got to him, he would break up with me and then we'd reconcile. So exhausting.

I guess I don't know how to process this breakup and move forward. And I need help and I don't know where to start. I'm in therapy but I feel emotionally stuck despite getting a handle on my anxiety. It really bothers me that such a great person and relationship was ruined because of these stupid attachment issues on BOTH sides; a way of existing that was foisted upon both of us through dysfunctional childhoods that we didn't ask for. Neither of us had loving parents who were there for us or stable homes. His dad was physically abusive. My mom was an alcoholic. It feels like our relationship was set up for failure by others decades before we were even born.

It makes me angry and I don't ever want to go through this again. I want to get better.

I wish I could talk to him but he went dark after this breakup and hasn't responded to my attempts to connect. I haven't heard a word from him and I desperately want to if only to know that he cares (or ever cared?) about my well-being. I believe he is with someone else now, someone who is more secure. While painful, I want what is best for him.

How do I grieve this properly and accept that a mostly good relationship was blown up because of these stupid attachment issues? How do I heal from this for my own benefit and the benefit of my future relationships? I can't save this one but I can save future ones by not letting this process play out again.

864,Conflicting Needs,"I (40M) started dating a really lovely, hilarious, and self-aware girl (36F) back in January. It was instant fireworks, and we really loved spending time together. After 2.5 weeks of dating (6 or 7 dates), I realized I was paying for everything, and I asked if she wouldn't mind splitting a modest dinner, and we had a brief conversation about how I feel like a relationship should be equitable, and I'm happy to spend more since I make more. I was encouraged that we were able to have a productive conversation about money.

But a couple of days later, she said, ""we need to talk."" We got together and she explained that she didn't feel like she was being swept off her feet in the kind of courtship that she wanted, and wants the man to pay for everything so she can be her feminine self, and I can be the masculine man. She's a 1st generation Mexican American so her culture was playing a role in her traditional ideals of courtship. She also is an actress and a student, and wasn't making a lot of money.

The conversation was a bit of a rupture, and it seemed like we had mutually exclusive ideas for how the courtship should go. She wanted to be put on a pedestal and swept off her feet with romance; and I wanted to see an equal investment from both of us in the partnership we were hopefully building together.

In the morning, I woke to a long text she'd sent in the middle of the night about how it feels like the magic is gone now, and we should probably go our separate ways. We texted back and forth, and then got on the phone, and we figured out a compromise where I would shower her with more lovey-dovey romance, and she would show me in her own way an equal contribution to the relationship.

Fast forward to 4 months later, and things were mostly good between us. It was revealed that she's got an avoidant attachment style and really values her independence and autonomy. I, on the other hand, am anxiously attached, and have a deep core wound from childhood around abandonment, and not feeling like a priority. This clashed for us repeatedly, where I found myself feeling anxious about wanting to spend more time with her than she was wanting to spend with me. She's got a 20 year old cat which kept her from feeling comfortable spending the night at my place because it would stress out her cat; and she didn't feel comfortable with me spending the night at her place because she had to wake up frequently to tend to her cat. I was disappointed we weren't able to travel, or do weekend getaways, or spend the kind of prolonged time together that I want to do with my girlfriend.

I found myself looking to negotiate compromises so we could spend more prolonged time. Ultimately, it weighed on her that she felt like she was disappointing me by not spending as much time with me as I wanted. I began needing reassurance from her as I picked up on her doubts and concerns about our relationship. I could feel the distance growing, and it was really triggering. She revealed she never really got over that early conversation about money, and still thought that I, as the man, should pay for everything so she could be her fully feminine self. One day, I complained to her that she went to sleep two nights in a row without saying goodnight to me, and that I was feeling unseen and unloved. It really set her off, and she broke up with me, saying it was the last straw.

She told me she needed space, but I'm terrible at giving women space, as it triggers my abandonment wounds, and I wanted to convince her she was making a mistake, and that now was the time for us to really grow since we were serving as mirrors for each other and really showing each other our inner-child wounding. I for sure saw clearer than ever the work I need to do on myself. And I wanted her to see that I'm capable of doing that work, and that we can work on ourselves together. But she had made up her mind, and my repeated attempts to contact her caused her to block me completely. This was about a month and a half ago, and its been a very painful time. Now she feels like I have no respect or regard for her needs or boundaries; and I feel like she doesn't care about my feelings. This clash between her need for space, and my need for reassurance has been magnified to the point where she is desperate to detach and heal and move on; and I'm desperate for her to see that she's closing the book on something really special. I know I need to move on, detach, heal, process. And I'm working on those things. It's just really hard when I think we're both just self-sabotaging based on our inner-child's wounds, and that she shouldn't throw this away since we've been so great at communicating, and have such a strong connection. But maybe I'm alone in thinking that. It obviously takes two to tango.

I would love to hear people in this sub's perspective on this.",15bhpyh,37,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/15bhpyh/conflicting_needs/,AnxiousAttachment,1
865,Let’s talk about triggers. What are they? What are we supposed to do about them?,"I think we are all too familiar with triggers. But what are they exactly? Are they really the problem?

When I know I am being triggered, I am actually not aware of memories of bad/traumatic experiences, but absolutely certain feelings are aroused within me. And what happens? I assume the cause of them is what seemed to bring them up. However, is that actually true? 

I am of the mind that they are not….necessarily. I mean something can remind us of the past but the past experience has nothing to do with that particular thing that triggered it. I believe it is the emotions that we feel that are reminding us of the past. The thing(s) that bring up that emotion are irrelevant in most cases. What matters is what came up, what emotion or thought pattern was triggered. We may generalize the emotion to be anxiety or fear or even anger. However, it doesn’t give us much to go on, unless we can hone in on the thought patterns that exist along with it. Weirdly we are rather disconnected from that part. We exist on automatic pilot when it comes to the beliefs/narratives/thought patterns that exist under the surface, which is the true driver of the emotion, and is even further removed from the thing that triggered the emotion to begin with. 

So what are we supposed to do with them? Is the fact that triggers exist the problem? Are we supposed to figure out how to eliminate any triggers whatsoever? My answer to this is No. The problem is not the trigger, in fact I think that triggers can actually be useful. As it can be a signal to alert us to something going on inside of us that needs attention, maybe healing or soothing. In some cases, not all, maybe it's reminding us of the past to help tell us that there is something wrong and we need to pay attention to keep from making the same mistake we made in the past. 

I think that really the key is learning to manage them by identifying what is going on at the core of them. Sometimes it may involve self soothing. Sometimes it is discovering those limiting beliefs/narratives that hold us hostage within ourselves. Healing and reframing those beliefs to heal and empower ourselves. Over time, the more we do this, it may lessen the amount of things that trigger us or the severity of emotions that come up with them. If these things are connected to past abuse, I think it would help to realize where the emotions are really stemming from, and then either being aware if this is meant as a warning to avoid something that could be dangerous, or where we need to remind ourselves that we are in fact not in danger and that we are and will be okay (a part of self soothing). Being more aware of the true cause of the emotions that come up when triggered, will give us the power to heal and start moving through life more confidently.

Even with all this I don’t think it is possible to eliminate triggers entirely. I actually don’t think anyone in the world is void of triggers. Yes, that means even secure people get triggered!!! We are all human and life is triggering, plain and simple. The main thing to look at is the response to the trigger, the level of severity in the emotions involved, and how quickly they are processed, and in turn that we are able to recalibrate ourselves. 

My goal is to not fear triggers, but accept them as a normal part of life, and at the same time use them to discover the parts of me that still need healing, and learn that I am capable of navigating them in a healthy way. 

What do you all think about triggers? Does this resonate with anyone else? Have you been able to get to the root of your triggers, and find that it helps lessen them?",143cpuv,37,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/143cpuv/lets_talk_about_triggers_what_are_they_what_are/,AnxiousAttachment,1
866,How do you re-focus on the self/circle of control?,"After a relational conflict, despite my best efforts, there are still times when I find myself trying to convince the other person to either:  
\- validate my feelings  
\- understand how I feel  
\- confirm they love me  
\- not leave me 

I find myself crying alot, obsessing over what has happened, playing it over and over in my head, trying to work out what went wrong, feeling shame over any unhelpful behaviors, high amounts of anxiety over needing to be near the person again and so on. My body feels like I want to crawl out of my skin. I want to escape myself but I can't.

After the first 24 hours, I then find myself in a research hole of trying to find information so I can fix the problem. Regardless of how the other person is responding (most the time they are silent/none responsive to me), if they are extra loving I find myself suspicious of their behavior and questioning it. I am exhausted. I am so fed-up with myself and feel so-so exhausted of being unable to do conflict well and it triggering me into some messed up version of myself. It impacts my ability to do anything which is beyond concerning for me.  


Does anyone have any insight on what this is? and what can I do to stop this?! How do I put the focus on my own circle of control and on myself during the intense moments?

Now when I see gratuitous distancing, left on read, ignoring, ""busy"" when it's on a consistent basis by close friends or a date I feel like ending the connection and moving on.

The other night, what I felt was a small conflict: me asking for simple requests, him calling me “demanding” and me getting defensive.. hurting his feelings.. then apologizing for my reaction. I asked for a hug and to make up and he refused. He held onto that for 2 days, said I minimized his feelings and that were incompatible because this keeps happening. I’ve been trying to make him feel heard and appreciated yet I too want to feel heard. I try bringing up attachment theory, bought 2 copies of “Attached” for us, but he doesn’t want to learn (read my book he hasn’t touched his).

871,How do you forgive your parents for setting you up for a life of pain and failed relationships?,"I thought I had a good childhood for most of my adult life. I'm only realizing at 38 years old how messed up it really was. How withholding love and affection was used as a form of punishment. How I was screamed at constantly and how my parents were so ashamed of the screaming, they told me if I ever shared information about my homelife with anyone at school, I would get taken away and put in a foster home. How I was punished at a young age for being ""ungrateful"" for normal things like rides to school and piano lessons. How I wanted soooo badly for either of my parents to have a conversation with me or show any interest in me at all without me having to owe them something.

How do you forgive? I'm 38 and going through my gazillianth breakup with a DA and I'm so exhausted. And now I've given so much of myself to people who will never love me that I'm losing my value as a woman. I know that's kind of B.S. but it's also unfortunately true in today's society and I don't know how I'm ever going to find anyone again. My parents are seniors now. How do I forgive them? No good can come from me resenting them anymore. They're old and it's time to let go of their mistakes with me. I don't know how though. I'm angry. I think I'm going to die alone. I have a lot of love to give, but I barely know myself. I'm a ghost. I barely exist. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself all of the things I've recently learned about my patterns and save myself soooooo much pain and hearbreak. I don't know what to do.",ypddh4,39,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ypddh4/how_do_you_forgive_your_parents_for_setting_you/,AnxiousAttachment,1
872,Set clear boundaries and I feel proud of myself... (for the time being),"I am a secure-learning AP (40F) and have been embroiled in a painful on/ off relationship with a DA-leaning FA (40m) for several years. The push-pull dynamic is cyclical in that he professes to love me and want commitment, makes promises to become more informed and attend couples counselling, then starts withdrawing and sending mixed messages without following through on his words. This results in me raising my concerns - I no longer resort to protest behaviours - and he either lashes out and breaks up with me or stonewalls me to the point that I pull the pin because nothing is resolved and I'm shut out. I then go NC, delete and block him. He then returns with promises to commit, etc. and I relent, giving him ""another chance"" until the next round of disappointment.

No, I am not blaming my partner for the toxicity. I know full well that both of us are equally responsible for perpetuating this dynamic by playing out the same scenario over and over again. The main difference is that I am informed and proactive in my quest to heal and earn security. Unfortunately, despite his regular declarations to do the same, he reneges and defaults to his usual behaviour. 

Anyway, the most recent conflict arose because he failed to communicate with me about his plans this last weekend and, once again, I felt like I was not a priority. Unlike in the past, I did not act out or resort to criticisms/ accusations. Rather, I stated what I needed and used NVC to communicate why I felt so sad and disappointed. However, despite my iterating that this is a resolvable issue and not a train-smash, he perceived it as further evidence that he's not equipped for a relationship and was hurting me again, catastophising everything. So, although he didn't completely shut me out and go radio silence, he stonewalled my attempts to resolve the issue. I let him have his space and only replied to his texts as and when he sent them. Trust me, he's made progress in this department. 

Tonight, he called me while I was at gym and I spoke candidly and without heightened emotion about our current situation. Effectively I've told him that I'm no longer prepared to accept this whiplashing push-pull dynamic. I stated what I needed and wanted: the next time he sees me will be in a therapist's office and he needs to demonstrate that he's at least more informed than what he is now. I also clarified that he would need to sort out his apartment to accommodate my staying there on a more regular basis. Ironically, I've only asked him to make good on his promises - nothing more, nothing less. I just am not available for anything less than that and I am only trusting actions, not words. 

Understandably, he was quite overwhelmed; although, honestly, it's been a long time coming. He said he'd call me this weekend to touch bases. I've told him that I will not be waiting around for him to make up his mind. 

I think he realises that the onus of responsibility is on him to meet me halfway and that I'm no longer prepared to accept less than I want, need and deserve. I am quite prepared to walk. I've done it before and I can do it again. I certainly will not be returning for another round of this. It took a lot of convincing and a final leap of faith on my behalf to agree to this last try, which was premised on his promise to 'do the work' and attend therapy - individual and couple.

For the very first time in this relationship, I feel strong enough to assert what I need and want, and I KNOW that I'm be fine with whatever happens. I'm unsure whether I've arrived at this place because it was inevitable given all the stops and starts and flip-flopping from him over the years or whether I'm leaning more secure these days. Irrespective, I feel a little proud of myself right now because I can finally recognise my worth and I am willing to walk away. I no longer feel the need to prove my value and 'earn' his love. Fuck that!

If you've managed to read until the end of this post, you've done well. I don't expect any responses, but I felt it necessary to document this decision because - for me - it represents a shift in who I am, what I want and how I am choosing to move forward. I'm sure that there will be moments where I feel anxiety bubbling below the surface and I will be plagued with doubt, but I intend to remain steadfast in my resolve.

873,i treat relationships like drugs,"i don’t know how else to describe what i do, but i know it’s related to having an anxious attachment. basically, everytime i’ve gotten into a relationship, i subconsciously give up all of my hobbies and free time for them. i’ve even quit jobs to spend more time with them. this pattern has obviously pushed away my partners rather than brought us closer, and if it did bring us closer it ended up being an abusive relationship. I hate being able to see the pattern in hindsight, because it’s never obvious in the moment. I feel like im an oxytocin addict to be completely honest. i don’t act like this in non romantic relationships, in fact i feel very stable when i’m single. my friends don’t understand why i can’t find a good man, but the truth is i have found very good men, even extraordinary men. my actions always push them away. my friends don’t see the side of me that calls them 100 times because i’m convinced they died in a car wreck on the way home. they don’t see how i take every molehill and make it a mountain and throw myself off time and time again. i’m the common denominator here and honestly i think i would cause a hell of a lot less damage if i stayed alone",xqkniq,35,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/xqkniq/i_treat_relationships_like_drugs/,AnxiousAttachment,1
874,Tips on breaking up with an anxious attachment style partner,"I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for almost three years now. We’ve had our differences, and we’ve reached a point where I no longer want to be in the relationship. I’ve attempted a break up 2 times, and each time I could not bear the way she reacted to it and I ended up giving in and telling her we can try more. I already have trouble letting people down and leaving them in a bad spot, I hate hurting people, especially the ones I care about. I guess who would love that?.. But my situations is I do it at the expense of my needs.

When we have these conversations, she always says it doesn’t work because we didn’t try hard enough, but I believe it’s just not meant to be. I still care about her, we are not in an abusive relationship. We both respect each other, but I don’t have it in me to be in the relationship any more. 

My last attempt failed and I’m not in a good place. I don’t feel like talking to her, when she texts I respond half heartedly and I realize that must suck for her which makes me feel even worse. I feel stuck, she’s had relationships before and she’s never broken off relationship before. She’s pushing too hard for this one and I don’t think she sees it that way. 

Do you have any tips on navigating this situation?

**Edit**: When I talked to her about braking up the last time, I told her how my need are not met, she said her needs are not met either. I explained how we differ and how I feel we've done our best and it's time to let go. I was direct, honest, and listened for question when she had any. I waited just a bit longer than I should have to leave because once she started crying, while hugging her dog (I love the dog...) and saying ""Bye *Insert my Name*"", I couldn't get myself to leave and just went back and hugged and told her it's ok, that we can try...

879,My (37F) first healthy-feeling relationship (43M) ended and I’m wrecked yet also somehow ok,"I showed up completely, used every tool I learned in therapy, and brought my very best self. 

I fell hard for a man whose 4 box grid looked identical to mine, it was eerie… both earned secures who leaned AP in relationships only. We met and had the slow burn vs the instant AP/DA chemistry, but once it took off, I opened up emotionally like never before. This man is someone special that I won’t forget and it was over far too soon. 

This will sound doomed when I say the next part but yes there were issues to surmount (he not only has military trauma to address but he is also in the midst of settling divorce financials after 3 years of being separated) and yet we had the most open, vulnerable, healthy communication I’d ever experienced. We were faced with some really rough stuff in our short time (death, health, finances, kids, career, mental health, his divorce) and never once did we disagree, raise a voice, or be anything but fully supportive. It was amazing honestly. 

We were working together and we were working so well. We had something great and we both knew it, we both talked about it openly as two adults who had suffered through unhappy marriages and know what real effort it takes to make something good work. And then things took a bad turn in his circumstances, he is now faced with a career crossroads driven by money, and he doesn’t know what he’s going to do or geographically where he’ll be in a year. So he broke it off and was honest about why, and my friends think he did the noble thing even though it hurts like hell. 

He told me he doesn’t want to end things  because I’m amazing and he cares for me, but he doesn’t feel right continuing because my life is stable and his is absolutely not. He said I deserve better than what he can give me today, that he is afraid to hurt me by falling short since he’s not handling all of his issues well, and he said he can’t match what I bring to the relationship. It’s a big source of shame for him that he can’t provide like he wants to, even though I don’t care one bit about the money. He acknowledged he isn’t as far along in his healing (past PTSD and he’s still enlisted too) as me. 

But damnit I really thought we had it… fuck this hurts. 

I brought my whole self and I showed up exactly as the kind of partner I wanted to attract. And it worked - I’ve never experienced the kind of safety, comfort, security, and caring as I did in this short while. I did the work in therapy prior and I did the work every day with us! I’m so proud of myself. And now, because of him, the bar has been raised significantly and my poor heart is both bruised and yet somehow already wiser for having been in this relationship. He restored my faith about how healthy men could behave (and should behave!) with a woman they care about. 

I’m firmly grieving this loss because this was the most rewarding relationship I’ve ever had and yet it was also my shortest adult relationship. I wasn’t done with him and yet it just wasn’t meant to be for us, for some reason that I’m trusting the universe about yet very angry with the universe about. He knew he couldn’t rightfully drag me along in his mess, and I know that too, and he let me go. Fuck. 

I guess the moral for us APs / former APs is that I advocated for my needs all throughout this, I didn’t shrink myself or minimize my desires, and I didn’t hide parts of me that I was afraid to show. Nope. I laid it all out on the table and I brought my whole genuine self. I don’t do anything half-assed and I shot my shot. I’m so damn proud of how far I’ve come in my healing to have been able to do that and successfully confront triggers in real time as they came up. I did my very best and I know there was truly nothing else I could have done…

But it's normal and human to grieve the thought of who someone was when it turns out they're not, grieve the good beginning and promises of a relationship after it makes a U-turn / ends.

Being secure doesn't mean not having feelings or not suffering when you lose someone you grew to care about. 

I'm secure and even though I never took personally my DA behaviours, even my self-esteem is untouched, even if I decided to cut contact because I know without a doubt that this wasn't the right partner for me and the relationship I wanted, even though I know it was the right choice because there was no future with them...

It's still someone I cared about that is now gone from my life, and a good few months of relationship (before he started displaying avoidant traits) that I enjoyed and would have liked to continue.

Even though I know it's not the end of the world and I'm moving on with my life peacefully, I miss him dearly, and I honor the feelings I had and allow myself to grieve. He was a kind, gentle person and always treated me well: he wasn't a monster, he wasn't abusive, he didn't cheat or lie, he was just not suited for a relationship.

You can leave someone and know perfectly well they weren't the right partner for you but it doesn't mean you magically become cold, indifferent and can turn off your affection like a tap. That would be frankly worrying if you could :) 

So don't shame yourself for having feelings, that's normal when you are a person who cares about others and has to mourn detaching from someone.",tcrsvl,37,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/tcrsvl/being_secure_doesnt_mean_you_dont_grieve/,AnxiousAttachment,1
881,I've started dumping people,"Once I realise I'm not actually into them and so I communicate that I no longer want to pursue a relationship etc. It's me trying to practice healthy boundaries and teach myself that not everyone deserves to be in my life, I should want them to be there lol so I should be assessing the merits.

However as soon as I do, my anxious attachment kicks in and all of a sudden I don't want them to go.

Ugh, boundaries are so hard. Can anyone else relate?

883,Awareness of AA makes you act avoidant?,"With learning about attachment styles, I wonder if anyone swings in the opposite direction in order to compensate.

I feel like if anyone could see inside my brain and feel my feelings, it would be obvious the amount of anxiety I feel.

But if you where to purely base your interpretation on my actions, I would seem more avoidant/secure.

I feel the fear and the desire to chase, but then my brain goes ""not this old chestnut"" 

I feel annoyed and pissed off knowing that I'm either going to get hurt or embarrass myself, so I respond by distancing even more out of resentment and as a form of damage control.

Then when they reach out I'm like ""oh, ok everything is fine"" and all my positive emotions return.

I don't act out anymore, but I'm afraid to show I care, or to express any needs.  

I don't make things worse, and I don't totally give my power away.

But internally I still feel like everything is on their terms, I'm afraid to show I care or express any needs, even if I'm not openly trying so hard, I still feel emotionally exhausted from internalizing everything.

It makes me wonder... What really dictates someone's attachment style? 

The way they feel inside? Or the may it manifests in outward actions?

Is it possible that your avoidant could be an experienced anxious in disguise?",r2q0ym,35,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/r2q0ym/awareness_of_aa_makes_you_act_avoidant/,AnxiousAttachment,1
884,I cried when I realised,"I went into therapy and managed to go back to my inner child. She is very troubled, always inside her own mind, her feelings were never acknowledged. She lived in a big house, was among the richest in the family yet was alone. 

In December when everyone was updating their Facebook photos to showcase family time, she closed her laptop and stuffed her face in her pillow as she cried in her lonely room since her parents were always busy.

I only realised today that I am on the high spectrum of AA. Very high. My partner is DA but when I act secure, he is the most amazing guy. I fail though, a lot of times. Why can't we be consistent? 

Yesterday I started crying in the bathroom. I went deep into the abyss of almost a depression like state, I started crying out for my mom and dad. I am 28 years old. I cried like a kid. I tried to self soothe but... I feel emptier. I felt like I wanted to run away from myself. From the world. I want to stop the need to control, I want to let go. 

I want the pain to stop. I need to rest and take a break but I cannot stop crying.

I laughed at myself over how my mind runs wild with imagination with guys I like within first couple of dates, and start building a future together in my head. It is often my downfall... I notice myself doing it, I can't stop it. I will tell myself to stop thinking about it. 

With this guy A, he is intelligent, charming, funny. He was hands on, handy with projects, great ideas, a gamer too. Heh ... Yeah... By the fourth date... He tells me he is on a break with his ex. 

Guy C, another computer geek, lots of similar interest, skiing, etc fell for him within the first date... Hoping for more. But he says there is no connection at the end of the first date. At least he did the rejection quick hey... 

Guy L, my ex cookie mould. Everything about him is like my ex. Intelligent, charming, his crazy ideas, his Yolo attitude, his don't give a fuck, and sharing similar interests. Went out for 3 months, then the ghosting and fading, and then ""I don't see it developing further"".

Funny with these three guys who hurt me the most... 
It's the ideas I have of them, that really hurt me... 
The future I dream of, having them around in my life. It's just the idea that I like of them. 

I need to start rephrasing how I think...

How do they add to my life. 
It's not just similar interest.
It's not just the charm and salesmanship. 
Are they accountable?
Do they reflect what I want in life? 
Do they reflect the values I hold? 

Ideas are nice, and I guess online dating, it sometimes feels you pick a piece (a guy) and try to squeeze it into your puzzle, without even looking at the piece properly. 

Stop dreaming hun, stop rushing to finish your puzzle when you don't even know what you are working on....

889,Ways to dissipate anxiety when you haven’t heard from someone in awhile,"I’m activated a bit now, so I’m going to overshare because it helps me process. But there is a TLDR 🤗

Before I go too far, I want to make it clear that this is not a “need” of mine not being met. My anxiety always flares up and taps into my fear of abandonment when I feel like I haven’t been reached out to within whatever arbitrary timespan my anxiety decides is proper that day.

Furthermore, my partner is a saint and has agreed to former attempts to touch base on a more scheduled way, but I intrinsically dislike asking my partner to follow rules around being in touch with me x amount of times. Anyway, it's not at all how I want my relationship to operate. I want to be reached out to when it feels natural to.

Sure, my anxiety would love for me to ask for a text every hour on the hour. But the calm, clear-headed me does not want that for my relationship.

That all out of the way, how do some of you self-soothe when those fears of “they don’t want me anymore, they don’t really care about me, I must not be that important, they’re only with me out of obligation” arise?

I can recognize the tightness in my chest and even that my fearful thoughts are arising and that they aren’t true, which i know are big wins in and of itself, but I struggle after that to still slow the thought down after that. Bringing my emotions and body back to reality. 
The thoughts just flow and its exhausting to go “thats not true” new anxious thought “thats not true either” - I constantly check my phone, which I keep on Do Not Disturb ALWAYS because I can’t handle hearing sounds/vibrations go off so I prefer never hearing anything and obsessively checking instead 🙄. 

I just want to BE and then be happy when I hear from him when I do. 
Not DYING to hear from him and then suddenly back to a normal heart rate when I do.

For double clarity, I hear from him several times a day on average and we are both immensely busy people. He does more than enough in terms of staying connected, I just wish my anxiety and nervous system could get on that page.

890,Envisioning What Kind Of Relationship I Want And How to Move Forward (Follow Up To AP Break Up Affirmations),"This post is a follow up to this one (https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/mqu9nb/post_ap_break_up_affirmations/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). Hopefully it helps someone get through the really challenging time of navigating break ups as an AP. 

Here goes: 

After and during a break-up as an AP, we can become consumed by the feelings of rejection and fixated on getting the relationship back, getting closure, or getting affirmation, even if we have a deeper intuitive understanding and knowledge that it isn’t right or working for us.

We can become preoccupied with the “good times” and become tunnel vision to avoid the things that clearly aren’t working. This is a time when we can become very desperate and communicate in ways that are accusatory, intense, or needy, then spiral in feeling of shame and “if I didn’t do this one thing, then I wouldn’t have ruined the relationship.” 

I’m making this post to bring light to the fact that this moment in time is a huge opportunity for us to do self reflection and inventory on what *we* desire, what type of relationship *we* envision, and if the partner we are fixated on is even the right person for *us.*

PT 1. Making the Decision to Leave 

This can be so hard to do, but it is actually a huge sign of self respect and grace to make the choice to exit the cycle. We can do so lovingly and without victimization or negative accusations against our ex. Remember, unless they are a true narcissist or they are intentionally abusive, they are probably just struggling and it has nothing to do with you. Choosing to acknowledge that it has nothing to do with you, and that it is an issue of compatibility and ability to meet needs, will liberate you from the obsession with being rejected and not good enough. 

PT 2. After The Break-Up

You can decide now how you want to move forward. This might be no contact, or you might feel comfortable talking a little here and there. Again, remember that you don’t have to make them the “bad person,” unless they truly did something harmful (cheating, verbal / emotional / physical abuse, etc). 

You can show them love and kindness if it’s comfortable for you without regressing on your choice or boundaries. You can affirm within yourself that if this person is meant to be for you, they will come forward and it will be revealed when the time is right and they are ready. No amount of pushing, pleading or persuasion will get them to arrive at this place. And if they never do, it is not a loss, it is only information. 

You got out of a relationship and dynamic that was dysfunctional and incompatible, and that is actually lucky. It creates space for the type of relationship / person you truly see yourself with. You are setting the precedent for how you are going to be treated in relationships by how you treat yourself.

If your ex immediately starts dating or sleeping with someone else, it is not about you. This person has clearly avoided their emotional work and this is a facility of how they cope. Guarantee, these issues will present themselves in their new relationship. Be thankful it isn’t you! 

PT. 3 Visioning What You Want 

Now is the time to get present with yourself and spend some time thinking about what *you* actually want in a relationship.

Think about some relationships you’ve witnessed that you feel particularly warm about. What elements does that relationship have that you like? Is it their ability to solve problems with each other? How affectionate and playful they are with each other? How they seem at ease, relaxed and like themselves around each other? Do you like that they work as a unit, or do you like that they seem to have full independent lives outside of each other that they both support? 

Write some of these things down, and work towards a list regarding what qualities you seek in your ideal relationship. Not like “6 feet tall and dark hair.” But qualities of how they work together, treat each other, and how you envision feeling in a relationship. Be realistic. Never fighting or having conflict isn’t real. Finding a partner who knows how apologize and work towards a solution after conflict is real. 

PT 4. Finding New Ways to Communicate / AKA Self Work

As an AP, we obviously struggle with intimacy in general in some ways. We are easy to lose ourselves, prioritize our partner, or become so preoccupied by the stress of our relationships that we can’t “put them down.” 

Implementing boundaries with how we communicate can really help us. 

If you know you are a chronic over-texter, make a limit that you will not send paragraph long texts. If you catch yourself doing that or typing out a novel, stop yourself. Read the message. What are you really trying to say or what need are you trying to get met? Where are you losing focus, fixating or being convoluted? What would be better talked about in person or over the phone. Simplify your message. 

If you know you respond / react immediately, make a rule that you will set a timer on your phone when you receive a message from someone whose activating your anxiety. It could be for 2 hours, 6 hours, or a day. When the timer / alarm goes off, you can send a message if you feel ready. This isn’t about withholding. This is about creating rhythm and balance in your life, intentionally slowing down, and taking the time to respond rather than react. 

If you know you have a habit of acting out when trying to get your needs met, try writing when you feel yourself getting triggered. What do you really want? Be clear and kind with your word. Avoid manipulating and acting out to get the response you want. If you communicate your needs clearly and respectfully and the other person can’t meet them, at least you know you did your best and didn’t act in ways that perpetuated a weakening of trust, communication and the integrity of the relationship. 

Continue to engage in your own life. Take time to focus on your own goals. Do not drop everything to mesh with this new person. It will leave you feeling resentful and without a stable foundation. Make priority and time for the other things, people and goals you have in your life. 

Pt 4. New Relationships 

Be willing to be vulnerable. If we want true intimacy, we have to let our guard down. It’s okay to say “I feel vulnerable right now, this trigger is being activated for me, can we talk through this?” Its not okay to try and control or manipulate the other person into being your caretaker through drama, building intensity, or making accusations that are unfounded. 

Remind yourself that it’s okay to lean back. You do not constantly have to be preoccupied with if they leave or not. Maybe you will be the one to leave! But this is a part of our need to control others and control outcomes to fit our constructed view of “safety.” If this person is for you, they will be for you! If they want to be with you, they will show you. Let things unfold. Let the process happen. If it doesn’t work out, again, it is information. We can appreciate these lessons that help us get clarity as we narrow in on the type of relationship we really envision for ourselves. These lessons are not there to hurt or harm us. Again, they are information. 

Finally, take responsibility for what is yours. You want to have a healthy relationship with your partner that is interdependent, not codependent. Your partner is *not* responsible for all of your fears, pain, trauma, PTSD, failed relationships, or childhood issues, even if they unintentionally trigger them sometimes. The work towards self security is ours to do, with ourselves, with a therapist, with friends. Our partner can be an ally in our process, but they can’t do the work for us or fill the gap when something is missing. 

If you find that they are making this move to security harder, this is the time to go back to Step 1. You get to make a choice! You’re not at their whim. If they aren’t the person who has the skills to communicate, listen, facilitate a healthy relationship, or co-collaborate, move on. 

Hope this helps at least somebody in their process. I know AP is hard, but we are *not* powerless. We can reclaim so much of our power, self worth, self love and direction by laying the groundwork and creating the space for the types of relationships that we truly desire.",mqx60y,38,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/mqx60y/envisioning_what_kind_of_relationship_i_want_and/,AnxiousAttachment,1
891,Invest as much energy as you invest on to them,"This is a sequel to my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/lz2262/what_do_i_do_when_i_want_more_than_someones/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

I am slowly realising that if someone is not showing as much interest or effort or appreciation, it’s on them more than you.
Say, if you switched roles with this person, would you do the same things as they do?
Are you a very loyal person who puts a lot of effort and energy into relationships and making your friends feeling appreciated? Are you a sensitive person?

If that person isn’t the same as you, that’s okay. It’s also ok to distance yourself from them and even put less energy and “loyalty” in the relationship. Why? Cos they are the doing the same thing to you, so there’s nothing guilty to feel about. I should be allowed to invest as much as they are onto them. 

I came across this realisation as I have many other friends who naturally make me feel appreciated and secure. There’s only 2 solutions for my problem, you walk away or keep tolerating the way they operate, which obviously not fair for you. 
If I’m putting 100 seriousness and loyalty, then I should be getting 100 back naturally, in a natural relaxed relationship. If someone ain’t feeling it, even if you obsess and fret, you will always be getting 50, even if you put 150.

Someone said, find someone who likes you for being you, not what you do for them. If it’s important to feel appreciated, then this person is not for you.

My mantra is, it’s THEM not me, I am a loyal sensitive person, and I deserve someone who is the same as me and put the same effort as me, and they don’t deserve this level of attention from me if they ain’t putting an effort to reciprocate. 

I am the kind of person who would feel guilty if I pull away or have some distance, but it’s only healthy to stop putting the other person on a pedestal and peel back for some perspective and focus on nurturing other relationships than fretting about one that makes me feel insecure.",m03ivt,39,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/m03ivt/invest_as_much_energy_as_you_invest_on_to_them/,AnxiousAttachment,1
892,"My childhood just hadn't given me the skills to cope with rejection, coping with love, coping with life....","I have never been kissed by my parents since I was 6. Mum just one day said, ""stop kissing me, you will give me pimples."". Hug once since 6, on graduation day. - when I brought it up recently, they just said, ""us Asians are not affectionate people."".

Yes, my parents cared for me, fed me, bought me gifts, brought the family for holidays ... Life took a turn when I started school, where it's like a mini rats race, doing well in school to please your parents, endless studying, ""do not hang out with those people, they are bad influence, do not go out, do not talk to boys, just work on your studies during the holidays, no tv, no music... "". You come back home with semi standard results, you get a beating. There was never an uttered word of ""I am proud of you"". Life was also made much worse, because I was bullied in school... Not fitting in at home, not fitting in at school. 

I could write another chapter about my mother. I don't really think my mum loves me. When you have a mother who tells you that you looked disgusting because you are fat, she can't bear the sight of you, in front of your partner (ex)... That you are doomed to being an old maid for having broken up at age 33. Yeah... So yes, I could go on about my mother. 

 I sometimes feel very much alone. I found my breath of affection and freedom  when I went to Australia for my studies. People hug here. People say they are proud of you for getting 60% here. People ask you out to hang out. 

I don't think I really know love - my ex and I started off as fling, which then stayed on for 6 years. I was a doormat, cause I din't want to lose him as what my idea of love relationship was. He gave me sex, I felt grown up. He asked me how I was, I felt loved. We have common interests, so we have a connection. He is intelligent, so he is smart and able to provide... That was my idea of love.

 - ignore the bits where he would sleep with other women, talk to other women ... It's those women ""fault"" for throwing themselves at him right? 
- ignore the bits where he would get drunk, lose his job, swearing that makes me uncomfortable. 
- ignore the bits, when I told him I was uncomfortable and not okay with it... He tells me to put up with it. When I was upset, he leaves the house for a house party with his friends. 


I feel desperately alone since the break up. People tell me to find comfort in being alone, this way when the right person rocks up, I know it's because they are right for me, and not that I have them in my life because I am alone. 

Since the break up... I tried to find solace in casual relationship, the guy is just like my ex... Trying to find a different ending to what could be my ex.2.0. Now I am trying to find breadcrumbs to tell myself that the casual relationship is worth it... The guy tells me he likes me right? That means he is worth the flakey messages, the non commitment, his non-effort to this, right? 

I haven't told anyone this... 
I have been telling myself verbally whenever I catch myself in thoughts, that I hate myself, that nobody likes me.

893,my thoughts on codependency,"I’ve been seeing some talk about codependency lately, and I’m wondering how helpful it really is in describing the dynamics of an anxious-avoidant relationship. honestly, I’m not sure if codependency (as I understand it) is a good lens through which to look at anxious-avoidant relationships, and by reading *attached* I began to see how this idea can actually be harmful to anxiously attached people. 

codependency started off as a description of the toxic relationships that substance addicts can have with the people closest to them, but has broadened as a pop culture term to ‘any relationship where one person needs the other’. this can often lead to putting all the blame on anxious types for their struggling relationships, by saying that if they could only be more independent and not impose their emotional needs on their avoidant partners, they’d be happier. 

but in reality, it’s completely normal to have your emotions affected by your partner. most people will feel happier when their relationships are secure and loving, and feel unhappy whenever they’re not. humans aren’t designed to be independent creatures that can completely self soothe every time we get upset. we’re social animals that use our social connections as a support system. when you’re in a volatile partnership that isn’t meeting your needs, the instinct to cling on tighter to the person who is constantly pulling away is understandable. it’s literally programmed into our brains to want to preserve our attachments. 

when one person in a relationship appears codependent, it is likely that they’re just an anxious person who instinctually is trying to preserve closeness with to an avoidant who is constantly pulling away and emotionally neglecting them. both parties are ‘at fault’ in this toxic situation. the solution to this is not for the anxious person to give up on trying to get their attachment needs fulfilled by their partner and become totally emotionally independent (which isn’t realistic or healthy), but for them to find a partner who will meet their emotional needs in a healthy and balanced way. 

many anxious people feel consumed by the need to preserve their relationship with an avoidant person because of that impulse to save their attachment. they become highly emotionally sensitive to their partner and cling onto them in an unhealthy way. but, they often find that these instincts subside when they find a secure partner who isn’t constantly running away. they feel more independent when they have a secure base they don’t have to constantly worry about losing. is this codependency, or just a natural reaction to a constant attachment trigger?

It's their hobby, but I always interpret it the wrong way and compare myself to those guys. She likes boy and girl groups, she's just been fixated on a boy group the past couple months and I always interpret it wrong.

Some background. I grew up very religious in a midwestern hometown with parents who covered their eyes or turned off the TV if there was a sex scene. The way I learned to love was to make the other person feel safe and comfortable. I never understood relationships where people watched porn together or talked about how hot an actor is.

Recently I've been doing English speaking tests in Asia with hundreds of students and when I talk about hobbies, a lot of married women mention loving korean dramas. I ask why and it's usually about the male actors' appearances. They are gushing about their eyes or their perfect face when they're married? Hearing these comments always shocked me.

I realized this is normal, at least outside the Christian bubble I grew up in. It's hard for me to hear these comments and feel that these people are in loyal, loving relationships. If they really loved their husband they wouldn't say that. (One of my thoughts that I now believe is wrong)

I talked to my wife about how sometimes when she gushes over kpop music videos it's an anxious attachment trigger for me. She feels like she has to hide her hobby and it's a big part of who she is. She said she doesn't care if I enjoy my hobbies or even watch porn in front of her.

""She even said, its ok if you watch porn in front of me, ""They have something you like that I don't have, so you can enjoy it as long as it's just to get off. Just don't cheat. If something makes me uncomfortable I'll tell you.""

When I heard this I was shocked at how secure she is in the relationship. She's miles ahead of me in terms of confidence and security. I realized she's not doing anything wrong for enjoying her hobby, I just catastrophize and assume she's missing something in the relationship because she doesn't get hyped for me the way she does kpop.

She explained married women's love for korean dramas or kpop like this:

""People have hobbies. In this country its normal to watch kpop or k dramas ans enjoy the performance. They just want to watch, not marry the actor. They aren't missing anything in the relationship because they have their husband AND their hobby. They don't have some secret desire they're missing in their relationship. The ones who talk about kdrama actors are just joking and probably have a great relationship.""

This is a big shock to me. I've been very ""faithful"" in not making her jealous, maybe to an extreme extent based on my Christian upbringing. And I expected her to treat me the same and never gush about guys. But her secure perspective is the one that makes more sense. 

I want to be secure like her and let me and her enjoy our own hobbies and trust the other isn't going to run off with someone more talented/attractive.

Has anyone felt something similar? A deep insecurity and jealousy of others who are more talented or ""desirable""? What exercises did you use to change your insecure thoughts? 

How can I break free from these unrealistic jealous thoughts and be more secure and let her like what she likes without thinking it ""means something bad"" or comparing myself to guys?",1635tu4,34,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/1635tu4/wife_likes_kpop_boys_and_it_makes_me_feel/,AnxiousAttachment,1
898,Has anyone's partner/ex told you they thought you were abusive during the relationship?,"Really rough relationship over 7 months. Broke up 3 weeks ago (I initiated but ended up being mutual) after breaking up already once before and having a lot of turbulence between. I'm fairly sure my ex is leaning DA but I'm honestly so confused by the whole situation. We initially got together because we had been friends and just seemed to click and it was bliss at first but turned unhealthy fast. 

Anyways, they told me they thought I was abusive in conflict (ironically when I had space from the relationship I actually kind of wondered if I had experienced covert verbal/emotional abuse but never used those words to him). The two times he's brought it up were when I was setting boundaries with behaviour I'd tolerate from him or breaking up with him. So I'm honestly just so confused. I don't think that invalidates him though, I can see where he's coming from. He said that he felt I was controlling and the relationship was one-sided.

I of course heard him out, apologized. I offered to be available if he wanted to talk or needed anything from me that could help with his healing process, validated the impact that I had and believed his experience, and expressed desire to make amends if he felt that would be helpful (not in context of getting back together). He says that he feels he got what he needed with the recognization. And he asked me if I wanted to hang out, and when I asked him why said partly because he misses me. I'm honestly just stunned and confused. 

I was really hurt in the relationship too and I just feel kind of stunned with how everything has gone. Has anyone else had an ex or partner say they were abusive?",135sjzy,36,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/135sjzy/has_anyones_partnerex_told_you_they_thought_you/,AnxiousAttachment,1

If i have a “need” like cuddling, quality time, sex, whatever I don’t express it i just let him approach me. Sometimes if he approaches me and it’s been a while its hard to open up again. I think i have subconscious resentment bc we only do things on his schedule. 
I broke last night and asked if hed come cuddle for a bit before bed. He was gaming w a friend but he said hed come out in a couple hours. 
He came and said good night to me and i asked if hed cuddle for a minute but he said he was running off a big win for his game and was in the groove and excited to get back so i went to bed kind of pouting inside even though i didn’t show it.

902,Boyfriend vacationing in Mexico wants to share hotel room with female friend he reconnected with,"Hey Reddit! To start off, I am anxiously attached and have traits of co-dependence that I'm trying really trying hard to work on and would appreciate your input on if you think I was being irrational.

My boyfriend decided to do a solo trip to Mexico for the holidays. We have been dating for just over a year and I had expressed to him how much I would love to spend Christmas with him. He doesn't celebrate Christmas and came out of a 4-year relationship with his ex-fiancée so this was the first time in a long time he has ever been able to do a solo vacation. Despite my disappointment, and being aware that he values freedom, I didn't want to be controlling so I was understanding and supported his decision to go. He's staying in a small town and while he's there he got to reconnect with a female friend from 20 years ago who happens to have a boyfriend who's away. She lives there in the small town now.

Today he tells me he will be extending his trip by a few more days and plans to visit another city in Mexico by driving. He then texts me a paragraph saying that the female friend will be joining him on this trip and that as he's looking at hotel prices, it may be cheaper for them to share a hotel room with 2 beds rather than book separately. He asked if I was okay with this and nonetheless that he loves me and I have nothing to worry about and he's asking me to be considerate. At first, I was flooded with emotion that I couldn't even respond. I felt so hurt that after expressing how much I wanted to spend X-Mas with him and him persuading me that he really needed to do this trip solo, he suddenly wants to travel with this other woman for a few days AND share a room. I felt pushed away, disrespected, unprioritized, replaced and  betrayed (but all of this might just be my abandonment issues being triggered). Once I took a moment to gather myself together, I responded:

1. I am uncomfortable with this since I don't know this woman
2. I find it really challenging to understand that someone like him who makes $300k/year and spends $400 on a meal will suddenly care about being ""economical"" about saving money on hotel rooms in a city that costs $50/night.
3. If he is suggesting to share the room because she does not have alot of money, it would make me uncomfortable that he is now also paying for her vacation knowing how much I wanted to be there.

He says he completely understands where I'm coming from and they will get separate rooms. I said that I was appreciative for his transparency and checking with me first. However, I continued to tell him how this made me feel and feeling jealous, confused that he suddenly wants to travel not solo, and taken aback that the thought would even cross his mind. He started to get frustrated with me, said I was making a big deal out of it and that he regrets asking me in the first place. Now I feel like he's going to resent me, use this against me in the future and label me as being ""jealous"" and ""controlling"" and being a burden on his freedom.

Was I out of line or controlling? Do you guys think I made a mountain out of a mole hill? How would you feel if you were in my shoes?

I want to mention that asides from this one solo trip he wanted to take, him and I spend time together and just came back from the bahamas and already have a trip to vegas planned next month. So it's not like he is avoiding vacationing with me.

**TL;DR: Boyfriend took a solo trip over the holidays to Mexico and met up with one of his female friends from 20 years ago who happens to live there and also has a boyfriend who's away. They are now taking a road trip together and he asked me if I was okay with them sharing a hotel room to save on money, despite hotels costing $50/night and he makes $300k. Now he is mad at me because I needed reassurance and felt I was making a mountain out of a mole hill.**

**UPDATE: Additional facts and context**

Thanks everyone for your response and support! It was very constructive and gave me a lot to think about. Just a bit of clarification and context:  


\- I am 24F he is 43M (I know...)  


\- I expressed wanting to go back home to Canada for Christmas so I can see my friends and family. He hates the Canadian winters and also never grew up celebrating the holidays so he said he'll go down to Mexico and finally visit that town we were talking about and that he's excited to do his first solo trip in years. We both agreed on this plan and the compromise was to meet up for New Year.  


\- This woman wasn't an old friend he 'happened' to run into. I've known about her for a year now and knew that they were going to hangout. When we originally discussed going to Mexico together, he said that his friend 'Sarah' lives there now and she teaches sexual healing and would be cool for us to take a class together. They are now in their 40s but used to hook up in their 20s, and haven't seen each other in YEARS. It didn't bother me because this is a lifetime ago. Fast forward to this month, as he was preparing for the trip, he talked about how it will be nice to see her and her boyfriend. And everyday he's in Mexico, she's there with him for 2-6 hours a day since she lives nearby. I know all this because he openly talks about it when we text/call and didn't hide it. To me, I had nothing to worry about and this was just a platonic rekindling of old friends. It just caught me off guard that he would say he wants to extend the trip because they want to roadtrip together and share a hotel room to save costs because she doesn't have much money.  


\- After expressing my fear that he will extend the trip again and I won't see him for New Year, and that I was a bit jealous she was chosen over me knowing I wanted to see this city, he offered to fly me down on the 26th and we could all do this trip together. I turned the offer down in fear that he would use this against me and say that I ""smother"" him.

\- His need for independence and freedom is BIG. He's broken up with me in the past a few times due to my ""controlling"" and ""jealous"" behaviour and picking fights. That's why I panicked when I suddenly feared I would be labeled as jealous and controlling or scapegoated for why they can't travel together.

**Here is the part that I struggle with.** I'm not sure if I'm gaslighting myself by making up excuses or if this is a valid point to consider. After he asked if I was comfortable with it, I said no and said why. He responded with ""No problem honey, I understand. We'll have our own rooms sweetheart"". I COULD have just left it there, said thank you, and moved on with the day. The co-dependent part of me somehow felt responsible for this problem they had to deal with regarding accommodations. Then the anxious insecure part of me kicked in to start poking at him for reassurances that I will not be held responsible and resented for ruining their plans by asking a bunch of questions like ""Am I the only thing standing between you guys sharing a room? That she cannot afford to come along otherwise? If I said I'm okay with it, will you guys do the trip? Am I the limiting factor to now why you guys can't go?"". He said ""She can't afford the hotel and I can't drive 6.5 hours by myself, so I won't go."" ""It's fine, I'm not upset, I know it bothers you so we won't go"". This question didn't exactly give me the reassurance I was looking for, I still felt guilty and responsible. So I kept asking those incessant questions. This is when he lost his patience, started ignoring me, and seemed to get more passive aggressive. **I know y'all with Anxious Attachments know about self-sabotaging behaviour. Is it possible I may have self-sabotaged? I let me need for reassurance on a responsibility that's not my problem take over? I feel like I could have just said no and left the conversation there.**",zukrp9,37,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/zukrp9/boyfriend_vacationing_in_mexico_wants_to_share/,AnxiousAttachment,1
903,I hate how you can put in the all effort while single then devolve back into old patterns as soon as you date,"Not that this happened to me recently but it just seems like every time I tried to allow someone to get close to me, I reverted back to my old anxious self. 

Constantly on edge, constantly jealous (although I wouldn't express that I am), constantly giving up my personal power. 

I just wonder if I'm even cut out for dating. It's exhausting. I know the only way to TRULY heal AP attachment is to adapt healthy coping mechanisms while in a relationship. But how can I do this when I'm constantly triggered?

906,"Anyone else feel like ""if they wanted to, they would"" can be a harmful statement?","I was thinking about this the other day and noticed how people often say that if someone actually cared, they would find a way. Recently, I had a situationship pull away (we were not on the same page with where it was headed, he wanted something casual, I wanted to move towards a relationship) and many people I talked to told me exactly that. However, that made me think about my own actions sometimes and how even though I have an anxious attachment style and can be really clingy, at the same time sometimes I get so overwhelmed I shut off and ghost most of the people in my life for a while. It never has anything to do with them and they are often people I care about a lot, but simply do not have the capacity to 'be there' at a given moment. After I've had my space, I am usually back to my usual self. But, while I'm overwhelmed, no matter how much I care for someone and no matter how much I want to do something I simply cant due to my.own mental health. So I feel like 'if they wanted to, they would' is a rather black and white statement that can make a person a villain for no valid reason (tho Im not saying that behavior is healthy, just not intended to be hurtful), because sometimes it really isnt about them not caring, nor is it anything the other person did.

907,"""Feelings Minus Fears"" - My Experience as an {FA}","On her lovely YouTube channel, Thais Gibson often says the actions exhibited by avoidants are the result of their ""feelings minus their fears."" As a textbook FA, I find this amazingly accurate. The trickiest thing about FA attachment is that our behaviors are so often not in line with our true feelings. These contradictions create confusion, distrust, and self-sabotage.

To suggest people involved with FA partners not judge them based on their actions feels a bit gaslight-y, but there is often much more going on beneath the surface. I find this most applicable when people categorically believe ""if they wanted to, they would.""

If it'll help others, I'd like to provide three examples from my own (F/30s) romantic history.

**No. 1: Serious Relationship with DA**

We were involved for two years, long distance. He was very kind, but his DA showed up as a certain limit to the emotional depth he'd display. I followed his lead and kept things easy-going, never discussing feelings or hopes for the future. After 18 months, I finally mustered the confidence (read: blood alcohol level) to text him ""I miss you.""

I immediately regretted it. Vented to friends, who assured me missing a lover was normal, and in no way was what I said over the top or clingy. Regardless, I felt I had opened myself to humiliation. To regain my sense of emotional safety, I pulled back hard. I ceased initiating communication and effectively set in motion our dissolution a few months later.

Feelings: 9

Fears: 6

Net: 3 - I genuinely loved him, but I felt so overexposed, my output was reduced to the level of someone who had lost interest in the relationship. It wasn't lack of attachment, it was self-preservation.

**No. 2: Casual Relationship with Secure/DA**

An old friendship turned sexual. Though I wasn't physically attracted to him, I adored him as a friend and appreciated how consistent and supportive he was. He admitted he felt I was ""out of his league,"" and after three months he ghosted me after a sleepover.

Historically, I do not ever continue to contact a ghost and I'm actually relieved to avoid any embarrassing rejection conversation. However, the loss of this friendship was upsetting. I uncharacteristically sent a final text, expressing how I cared for him, and asking if there'd been a misunderstanding. (Spoiler alert: I never got a response.)

Feelings: 6

Fears: 2

Net: 4 - I cared enough about him to stick my neck out and see if we could reconnect. This would be perceived as me being invested in the relationship, but the reality is I cared *so little* for him, reaching out after a month of silence was a tolerable risk. The prospect of him continuing to ignore me didn't have the power to deeply hurt me.

**No. 3: On/off saga with FA**

My relationship with my FA ex is what attachment theory nightmares are made of. We triggered one another's wounds, but couldn't let one another go. The intimacy would build, one of us would chuck a grenade into it with toxic behavior, we'd fall apart, then come crawling back together. FOR OVER A DECADE.

In the midst of Covid lockdown madness, I couldn't handle it anymore. We were both in individual therapy, but we were also both deteriorating mentally. Seeing how badly he was unraveling made me terrified that at any moment he was going to terminate the relationship to save himself.

I feared losing him would annihilate me. After months of pulling back from him, and after a seemingly inconsequential conversation, I ghosted him and blocked him on everything. We have not spoken since.

Feelings: 10

Fears: 10

Net: 0 - It'd be easy for an outsider to call my behavior abusive or narcissistic or indicative of having used him for validation then cut him loose when times got tough. But nothing could be further from the truth. I felt like I would die if he abandoned me, so I abandoned him first. The illusion of control was worth losing the love of my life.

**Bonus Round!**

Toward the end of the relationship with the FA, he called me in hysterics, admitting he was ""intimidated"" by me, that he was ""afraid of the power"" I had over him, that I could ""destroy him."" He compared me to the Sword of Damocles dangling over his head. At the time, I was horrified. I couldn't understand how someone I loved could see me as such a malevolent force.

In hindsight, I empathize. This is just my educated guess, but for him it was probably...

Feelings: 9

Fears: 10

Net: -1 - We loved one another terribly. We were literally terrible at loving.

I hope this has shed some light on the FA experience, and how bewildering and self-defeating relationships can be for us and our partners.

908,"I don’t trust my boyfriend at all, is my only option to be single?","I have to confess that i do not trust my boyfriend at all and don’t know what to do. he hasn’t done anything to disrespect me or lose my trust, it all branches from the fact that during our talking stage i saw him being flirty with his coworker on social media. that was 3 years ago. It’s one of the reasons i stopped seeing him. Never told him that until recently. We recently started dating again and have been an official couple since three months ago. 

How do people stay in long term relationships without the constant fear of being left by their partner ? This is how i feel in ALL my relationships or situationships, not just this. ANY small thing can set off my paranoia or jealousy for the rest of the relationship. 

It’s been only a few months in with my SA boyfriend and my heart squeezes with anxiety all the time. 

Because he’s so amazing and attractive i constantly fear that any day now he’ll meet another more beautiful girl and who’s more chill than me or more fun or something that he’ll fall for and ditch me for. Or maybe it’ll be that pretty ex-coworker he used to hookup with that’s still his friend on ig. Or maybe it’ll be someone to comes up and orders a drink from him at the bar he bartends at. Or someone he meets at a random event or party. It can happen anywhere at any time. I’m so scared. 

Everyday i have these thoughts.

Him and his friends work in nightlife, which is a hotbed for sexy single women who are tipsy and stuff. So him being in that scene really worries me. 

but he’s always been the relationship type of guy where his relationships have each lasted 1-4 years, and based on his demeanor and the kinda of girls he’s dated before he isn’t the shallow type. 

But idk, i simply can’t shake this constant fear that he’ll leave me for someone else any day now. 

How do i just accept this to be a possibility and deal with it? I’ve already confronted him about every little thing that makes me feel jealous and he reassured me every time. He even once in a heated argument said that if i don’t trust him i should just not date him. 

I know he didn’t mean that and was just aggravated with me but that’s the advice i see a lot online too. 

but it doesn’t matter who i date. I always get obsessively jealous and paranoid of another girl coming along and stealing him. I’ve never been cheated on ! I just feel like i hear these stories so often or someone monkey-barring and i’m so scared it’ll happen to me. 

If i dump him i’ll just have this fear with my next boyfriend anyway. 

So how do i live with this feeling and stick this out? 

tldr: i don’t trust my boyfriend even tho he didn’t do anything wrong. how do i calm tf down",wxcgtd,36,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/wxcgtd/i_dont_trust_my_boyfriend_at_all_is_my_only/,AnxiousAttachment,1

It's hard to filter at times. But after talking to some friends, I realized what I was getting anxious was real and not an overreaction.

913,DA ex contacting me after a month of NC,"Hey everyone, so I posted a little while ago about the messages my DA ex sent me after not hearing from him in over a month after I went NC. Thought I'd update incase anyone is interested and maybe it can give you a little insight into the baffling minds of DAs. It's a long one so sorry.

As a bit of backstory, he broke up with me (AP) after 7 years together. He broke up with me just days after we put an offer on a house, just two months after talking about wanting to marry me and buying a sapphire to make my engagement ring and a day after finding out he might lose his job. He said he had been lying to himself about wanting to marry me, that he didn't think I was ""optimistic"" or ""successful"" enough for him and that he didn't think we made eachother happy. I felt like in reality he was completely emotionally overwhelmed and wanted to run away to protect himself. I asked him if he would do couples therapy with me and he said yes but showed no interest. He then proceeded to spend the weekend with me giving me mixed messages about not wanting to ""give up"" and apparently used me for emotional comfort before completely disappearing from my life. I then decided to respect myself and go NC and move on. 

Anyway.
 
First, his best friend invites us over for an event and I have to awkwardly tell him he broke up with me. I realise he may have not told anyone about the breakup and this makes me angry that he avoids having to deal with the discomfort while he forces me to do it.

Then, he messages me a week later telling me he's ""sorry he's been distant"" ""hopes I've been well"" and then proceeds to update me on his life and how he's been making progress with his dad's estate (his dad passed away 2 years earlier). I'm baffled as to why he is telling me and why he seems to be ignoring how horribly he's treated me. He also seems to be fishing for compliments which I'm not willing to give him. 

I respond saying ""that must be a relief for you, yes I've been busy"" 

He then texts me a few days later asking me my opinion on a house he wants to buy for himself.

This makes me rage as we were making offers on houses together and now he's trying to use my knowledge on real estate selfishly for himself. But, I let myself calm down and reply ""why are you asking me?""

He then responds ""because I'm still looking"" and then proceeds to ask me what dentist I use because he thinks he has a cavity.

I've lost my shit at this point and I'm an absolute mess. It's like he has no empathy at all and is being so cruel and heartless. He discarded me and now wants to use me for his benefit. 

I send him a long message telling him how hurtful he is being to me, that it's inappropriate to ask about houses for himself when he knows we were putting offers on houses together before he left. That he gave me mixed messages saying he didn't want to ""give up"" and agreed to do counselling while showing no interest in doing any of those things. I tell him that he isn't respecting my feelings, is showing no empathy and is acting like our relationship meant nothing to him. That he devalued and discarded me by saying I wasn't ""optimistic"" or ""successful"" enough, yet he wants to use me for his benefit. I ask him what he wants from me. 

He responds saying ""I'm not doing alright. I need time. I'm sorry""

I reply ""well I'm not doing alright either. I was always willing to work on issues together with you and I blamed myself for not being good enough."" I tell him how this experience has taught me to work on myself, live by my values, find my purpose and not rely on others to give me happiness. I tell him I only have room in my life for people who respect, value and love me. I said one thing I will say that has helped me is learning about attachment theory and I think it can help him too. 

His response ""I will look it up""

At this point, I don't have any interest whatsoever of being with him again or contacting him again. The damage is done. But, I am glad I got to get everything off my chest and tell him exactly how I felt and how it is not ok how he treated me. I'm proud of myself for keeping my cool and being mature in my response because it was very tempting to just explode at him and I didn't want to give him any excuse to feel self pity and label me as the ""crazy bitch ex"". I'm also glad I told him about attachment theory because I genuinely think he needs help. He is one messed up person. 

Anyway, if you read all this, thank you, and I hope it can help in some way. Love to you all, I appreciate how you've all been so supportive.",ohi3vk,36,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/ohi3vk/da_ex_contacting_me_after_a_month_of_nc/,AnxiousAttachment,1
914,Like Being in a Dark House,"Being in a relationship with an avoidant person when I am anxious is like being stuck in a house with someone who was raised in a house with all of the doors and shutters closed.

When he was little, every time he tried to open a door or the shutters, his parents would rush to keep them shut tight.

The only time he can remember seeing the doors or shutters open was on a nice day, his parents would open them a little to let in the light. Even then, the child was not let outside to play.

Once, the child remembers, the door blew open and there was a horrible tornado. Luckily, his parents were able to get the door shut tight again – that was scary! From then on, the child helped to ensure the door and shutters remained closed tight.

His house was a safe house, and he loved it.

…..

I, on the other hand, grew up in a house where the door and shutters were controlled by my parents. 

If I tried to open them, sometimes I was allowed, more often it was ignored or my mom would run to shut them.

Sometimes, my mom would open everything, and it would be a storm, rain would be pouring in, and everything would be soaked. We would just sit there getting soaked.

Sometimes, everything would be open, and it would be glorious sunshine. 

A few times, I remember going outside.

Sometimes, I was dragged outside in all kinds of weather. 

Sometimes, everything would be shut up tight, and I’d live in a dark house too. Unsure of when things would open again.

Sometimes, my dad would knock down a chunk of our house during a storm, and rain would just come pouring in. Those times were really scary.

My house was an unsafe house, and I vowed to never live in such an unsafe house again.

…...

Now, he is grown, and I have moved into a house with him. In our house, he keeps the shutters and door closed. I like being with him. But, I remember the outside, and I miss it.

Even with me asking, he does not like to open the door or the shutters. Occasionally, if the day is really nice outside, he will crack them a bit, but he won’t go outside.

Sometimes, I open the door and shutters because I miss the outside. Whenever he sees them open, he shuts them right away. It is a constant push and pull between us.

Occasionally, there is a storm. Sometimes I open the door and storm winds come in. This really upsets him. If he can’t get the door shut, he will go hide in the cellar. Sometimes he’s gone for a long time, and I am alone in this house.

It’s a problem when we have a leak in the roof. I can’t get up to the roof by myself, I need him to lift me. I also know that if we work together, it’s a 5-minute patch. But, trying to convince him to come outside with me to fix the hole can take hours.

By the time I drag him outside, we finally fix it. Afterwards, he runs back inside and is so drained, that I can’t convince him to crack the door or the shutters again for a while, even if the day is nice.

It’s so overwhelming for him to go outside, that we don’t always get to patch the hole.

We have several holes that have been in the roof for years. I’m still trying to convince him to come out and patch them with me. With each storm, they grow a little bigger and leak a little more.

I love him, but I am so tired of being in this house with him. It’s so dark in here, and I miss the outside. Now, too, there are so many holes. It leaks when it rains, the heat pours in in the summer, and the cold and snow pour in in the winter. It seems we can’t get any relief.

One day, I threatened to leave the house all together.

This is terrifying for him. As much as he is scared of the door and shutters being opened, he cannot fathom being in the house all alone.

So, he immediately runs to crack the door and the windows. I feel relieved to have the light, and feel myself relaxing a bit. Okay, I think, I can do this, it’s not so bad. And, I am with him.

Over time, I unpack my bags, and he feels secure that I am staying. Meanwhile, the light is making him uncomfortable. He boards up the door and shutters. By the time I notice, things are very dark, I can’t find him, or my things, or even the path to the door.

One day, I stumble upon the door, and I open it. And, I step out. He appears! I beg him to come with me. For fear of losing me he steps out for a minute, but then it is too much, and he runs back inside, dragging me with him.

He promises I can leave the door cracked a bit, and the shutters open a sliver to let in some light, as long as there are no storms. He promises he won’t shut them again. He promises it will be better.

I tell him I’m not always sure of the weather when I open the door and the shutters. There might be a storm. I can’t promise.

I don’t want to leave him alone in this dark place, but I feel starved of light. I think maybe I am a different kind of creature than him, and I worry I cannot survive in a place like this. That I might die.

I’m scared he will shut the door and the shutters again when I’m not paying attention. I’m scared he will disappear somewhere in this house, and that I will get lost again.

I’m scared this house is becoming too familiar to me. That the next time there is a nice day, or even a storm, I won’t even want to go out. I’ll just stay in this dark house with the leaking roof. I’m scared I am becoming a creature like him.

The worst part is, now we have two little ones. They live here with us. I want sunshine for them. I want them to play outside without fear. I want them to feel confident in storms and sunshine and snow, all of it. I want them to come and go from this house, without fear of being alone.

In spite of everything, I stay. This house is at least safer than the house I grew up in. And, I don’t want to leave him.

And, I find it harder and harder to get to the door, and the door seems to be getting heavier and harder to open. Sometimes I wonder if it’s even worth the effort.

When I do finally open the door, he is with me in the light for a moment… then, he gets scared and shuts it again.

Somehow, losing the light feels worse than just staying in the dark.

So, I stay. And, I try not to open the door and the shutters too much. I need to open them a bit to survive, I think… I just try not to open them so much that it upsets him because I need him to survive too, and I can't bear it when he hides.

As much as I hate this house, I’m terrified to leave.

There is security in the darkness of this place.

So here we are. Him confused as to why I can’t stop opening the shutters and the door. And, me feeling that there never seems to be quite enough light.",oawe54,35,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/oawe54/like_being_in_a_dark_house/,AnxiousAttachment,1
915,Just ended things 😔,"I was in an online LDR for a few months, but felt my needs weren’t really being met in terms of quality time spent and consistency. We tried to compromise, but I still felt highs and lows, so I ended up suggesting being just friends. That was a mistake because I clearly still had romantic feelings for this guy. In a sense, being friends was even more anxiety-inducing, because the thought of him with someone else would break me every time it popped into my head. My gut was telling me (literally; my anxiety was causing reduced appetite, upset stomach, and diarrhea) that this was not a sustainable way of life.

I wanted to talk with him via video chat or at least synchronously, but I felt (perhaps wrongly, I don’t know—this could be one example of my anxiousness making the relationship harder) that he was maybe avoiding me because he could sense something was up. So today I initiated no contact with a message explaining my feelings and wishing him the best. We always cared deeply about each other and there was no ill will, manipulation, etc. It just didn’t work out because our expectations, priorities, and needs did not match at this time.

He saw the message and we sat online together in silence for a long time; he was occasionally typing but eventually left the session without saying anything. I respect that, and I do feel a bit of guilt because the message may have caught him a bit by surprise. The last thing I want to do is hurt him, although hurt may be inevitable. Although I do wish we could have both gotten the perfect closure, I recognize that it’s not possible for everything to be like a movie script.

I really do want to have him in my life in the future, but I need to listen to my head, my heart, and my gut. Obviously it depends on my own healing and his healing as well.  I don’t know what the future holds, but I do feel a sense of relief that I can start to heal. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. I just needed someone to share my emotions with; the past few weeks have been a roller coaster.

**Update**: he messaged back the most supportive message and now I'm a ball of tears. But I still think it was the right decision for me. The circumstance wasn't going to change in the foreseeable future, so I had to make that tough call for the sake of my mental, physical, and emotional health.

916,How can I stop giving my avoidant powers over me?,"As an AP, my moods are hugely impacted by my avoidant. When I find a tiny little hint that he still cares about me, I'm happy. When he says something I don't want to hear, I'm depressed and cry. 

I don't like the fact that my emotions are up to him. It's annoying even when I'm happy. But I literally have no idea how to stop this. I just want to be okay and calm regardless of what he says or does.

917,Addicted to a person,"How do I overcome the addiction to a person? Everytime I feel anxious but I talk to them it soothes the anxiety and I feel relief. How do I get the relief I need without them. Does it get easier over time? 

This person is not good for me. They have hurt me a lot, comes and goes, doesn't give me stability and commitment. Yet I feel like I can't live without them. The thought of it makes it hard to breathe. I don't know why I'm so addicted to them. Living without them terrifies me more than anything and I can't cope. I'm in NC right now but I feel dehabilitated. Like if I just reach out to them and see them everything will be okay. I want to run straight to them to just to escape the horrible feelings in my chest. I am deeply addicted and I get literal symptoms of withdrawal.

I didn't ask him back so I started to worry he asked it because he wanted me to ask him. Then I started to worry he wanted to tell me something but I didn't give him chance. Then I started to worry he wanted to break up or tell me he met someone else but he couldn't because I didn't ask.

919,You can feel your feelings without reacting,"Healing started for me when i made the hard choices to protect myself no matter how painful it was. My guy went completely cold on me and started playing mind games. I knew what he was doing. The fact I was resisting my intuitions told me exactly what I need to know about this situation 

I was angry, I cried a lot. I cried this morning. I still can't get them off my mind lol. But it's been a week and I never reached out. Last time he pulled away, I respected his decision and left him alone for 3 weeks. 

My mistake was allowing him back. I shouldn't have done that. I'm still learning my lesson. No matter how triggered you are, that does not mean you have to react to it 

Especially when that person has laid boundaries and you're tempted to cross them in attempt to soothe yourself. I haven't done that in years, but it still applies to me. 

I still get urges to reach out and protest (and I'll admit l protest by withdrawing and sulking sometimes) but every time I think about how *cringe* I'm going to feel later, every time I've acted on pure emotion, I've regretted it. Now when I get that urge I think to myself ""will I spiral into a ball of shame and begin mentally beating myself and convincing myself that I'm unworthy of basic love and respect?""

If the answer is yes, it's a lot easier to stop. The flooding you feel after abandoning yourself is soooo much more painful than the initial loss of connection. Please save yourself.

920,Just broke up with DA,"I broke up with my DA patner a few days ago. The final straw was when I called him because I really needed something, and he kept ignoring my calls. He sent me a message saying he hated how emotional I was and didn't want to answer the call because it was a waste of time.

I realized this relationship had me feeling panicky, unheard, and ignored. Whenever I tried to raise any kind of issue and communicate he would shut down. This included insulting me, calling me emotional and needy, or most commonly just isolating I.e ignoring messages and calls. 

At the start of the relationship he was somewhat normal. He would text and call regularly the first few weeks, would meet up often and seemed like a great guy. After a few weeks he started talking about his need for independence, space etc. He would go a few days without texting or calling and say he was busy with work. Anytime I showed emotions he would get scared and tell me he couldn't handle emotional people. 

Now I've broken up with him I feel somewhat relief. My brain in giving me montages of the times I was with him and felt great and happy. But I'm trying to remember all the days I felt alone and cried because I couldn't get any kind of response. Not once did he soothe me or reassure me and the whole thing was anxiety inducing. I was stuck in a trap and now im out of it I want to heal. There was something addictive about it, but I know that it's not what I need.",11d3h5n,35,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/11d3h5n/just_broke_up_with_da/,AnxiousAttachment,1
921,"Early Dating Anxiety, help!","Oh my godddd early dating is really something else?! At the very start I’m really nonchalant and could not care less. But a few days in, it feels like a flip is switched and I get so hyper aware of everything. I start to reply to messages super fast when previously I’d just do it whenever I have time. I start to also feel so anxious and clingy, even though I’m trying not to manifest it. 

I’m not making any of this a problem to my dating partner, and i find that so far they’re sweet and pretty secure, it’s just a lot of internal turmoil and anxiety. We’re also taking things slow which I appreciate, but I just feel so needy like I suddenly need their attention and validation when previously I didn’t? Like now I’ve started reading into his text messages, trying really hard to have a conversation when previously everything would come naturally… I feel so hyper aware and not me. 

I’ve been burnt so many times by people who weren’t securely attached and now I just feel on edge all the time and it’s really taking out all the fun of dating. 

I’ve read some helpful tips on this lovely sub, talking about how to deal with early dating. Some points I really liked are:

- writing a list of stuff you don’t quite like about your partner in case you find yourself idealising them

- realising that dating is not even about whether they like you, but it’s whether YOU like them!! whether they fit your standards!

- writing a list of pros/ things you like and love about yourself so you’re reminded of your value and know that even if this doesn’t work out you’ll still be grand ✨

- continuing hobbies, hanging out with friends and resuming life as it was before you met them


But I still feel like even though I practice these, internally I still feel so unsettled.

922,My boyfriend broke up with me because my health issues were too stressful for him,"My boyfriend (42M) and I (37F) had been dating for five months when I was struck by an emergency health issue. Long story short, I had two ER visits and two surgeries and a terminal illness diagnosis (although by terminal I mean around the age of 65-70). During the month I was going through treatment and diagnosis I heavily relied on him to pick me up from the hospital and be my sounding board etc. he took amazing care of me but after everything was pretty much handled and we were getting back to life together I noticed he wasn’t very affectionate or reciprocal of my affections. I pressed him on the issue and after brushing me off several times I finally acted out and he finally admitted he wasn’t feeling attracted to me anymore. He had been racking his brain as to why and all he could come up with was that taking care of me while sick reminded him of his cancer journey. I completely understood and said I wanted to work on it together but he said now that I knew about it he just wanted to switch to being just friends and see if feelings ever redeveloped. I obviously declined. 

I have to say I was completely blindsided. I met him a year after my divorce and wasn’t sure I even wanted a relationship. He pursued me avidly and showered me with compliments and things like “I can’t believe I finally met my person.” He eventually wore me down and when I gave into his overtures and returned the sentiment he responded with “I know you are committed to me. You have no idea how reassuring that is.” After that I started to feel a distance grow. The divide continued to grow until my health crisis. Now I’m left reeling wondering how someone that pursued me so heavily and told me I was the love of his life could just switch so suddenly. 

I’ve recently read the book and took the tests and discovered I’m secure with some anxious tendencies and he was avoidant with some secure tendencies (almost equal). It really helped me to forgive him his avoidant attachment beyond his control (falling out of love and fretting over it) and also forgive myself for acting out due to my anxious attachment tendencies. I guess I’m stuck wondering if this love bombing he did is a trait of avoidants? If I’m generally secure but can be triggered into old anxious habits do I need to avoid people with all avoidant tendencies? I mean, no one is completely secure right? I’m so scared I won’t be able to vette people when I begin dating again.

923,got cheated on by avoidant partner,"i have been in an AA/DA relationship with an avoidant for four years now. Over the last year, our relationship has been extremely rocky but I tried hard to fight for it. I got therapy, worked towards healing my anxious attachment, and made a big change in my career. 

Tonight I found out he has been cheating on me for the last five months. I feel disgusted, hurt, shocked, and traumatized. I feel like I don’t know the man I have known the past four years. He would always bash cheaters, told me how being cheated on hurt him, etc. I was sent proof of his cheating tonight.

While it hurts, I am finally free of him. Cheating is one thing that will cut my attachment and abandonment fear for you quick. Despite it, I am so heartbroken. Has anyone else been in similar situations or have any insight or advice?

924,I thought the third cycle would be different. It wasn’t. I walked away.,"I’m an FA who used to lean AP with other avoidants, and after a year of therapy, I am now leaning secure. I’ve been in an off/on situationship and a casual dating thing with another FA for just over a year. The third cycle started out so much differently because of all my therapy and I was in a stronger place. We actually developed a true friendship, a strong friendship. As always, he pushed it in a romantic direction. For three months he had been showing up. He was consistent. He was respecting my clearly stated boundaries, and meeting my clearly stated needs/standards. I still didn’t trust him 100%, but things were actually going really well. Yeah, I was still bothered by the fact that he was slowing down with initiating contact and initiating one on one time. to be fair, I was traveling nonstop and hadn’t been home very much for the previous six weeks.

A week ago, we accidentally stumbled into the DTR conversation. Even after over a year of this and all the incredible effort he was putting in to meeting my needs and going outside of his comfort zone, he said he still didn’t know what he wanted. He said he felt that my feelings for him were stronger, meaning, he wasn’t in love with me. without going into great detail, we are in the same circle of friends and occasionally work together, and anyone and everyone we know and even complete strangers comment to both of us about how love we are with each other just from seeing how we interact. His actions and the way he looks at me and talks about me, it’s obvious to everyone except for him. I’m sure many of you know what I’m talking about.

Anyway, I’ve seen this movie before and I refuse to engage in Groundhog Day. So I told him, you need to go and figure out what you want. I want you to be happy. If you figure out that it’s me you want to be with, that’s great, and I hope that I’m still around and available to explore that with you. But in the meantime, I can’t wait for you, and I’m going to go do my own thing. The conversation was very healthy and very positive. He said he’s gotten a lot of clarity in a lot of things and he needed to process. I said, great. Go do that.

All I can say is thank God for therapy. I’m very sad, very disappointed, and upset that he led me on yet again, although I’m fairly sure that it’s unintentional and it’s just his deep need for intimacy driving it before the fear of it kicks in. If he hasn’t figured out what he wants in the six years since his divorce and the year we’ve been together, he’s not going to figure it out anytime soon. it’s been a long and difficult journey, but after three cycles, I’m finally convinced that the fourth cycle would not end differently, even if he were to come back and say that he wanted to be my boyfriend. The combination of extreme fear, core wounds, very low self-esteem and low self-worth is just way too much for anyone to dig through. And I just don’t see him going to therapy. I think he feels he can figure it out on his own, and it’s not my job to help him get there.

I’m sharing this because I really thought we were going to be the exception. Things were so different this time around, he was really showing up, and I thought that me finally feeling and behaving secure would help pull him along that direction. Unfortunately, it didn’t. If you’re in the A-A trap, I’m sorry to say but it will not get better. Please get help, please get some therapy if you can, work on your own shit so that you can also develop the strength to end the cycles and walk away so you can find something better. It is heart wrenching and so incredibly difficult, but you need to love yourself more.

ETA: He texted me three weeks later after breadcrumbing me to tell me he just wasn’t in the headspace to be in a dating relationship, he knew it wasn’t what I wanted to hear, and he was sorry.

When we first started dating I would have these mild feelings of jealously, anxiety, anger, over little things like if she didn't text me back or she wouldn't want to do the things I wanted to do, but this was so early on in the relationship that maybe we thought we were just feeling each other out.

What really helps is knowing that even though all of my exes have come back and WILL come back, they're not coming back for good reasons. It's not because they ""care"", it's not because they ""love me"", and I'm pretty sure they don't genuinely miss me

Their ego is hurting because I'm not talking to them anymore and that's it. I'm just ego fodder and I'm tired of being this for people. Beyond romantic relationships as well. It's like I allow myself to be used as a soundboard to reverberate whatever people want me to say to them that makes them feel good. 

I think that's a good sign that I would be a good partner. Just need to work on being more self sufficient first 🥴. But now I feeling like relationships are exhausting. I'm just expecting people to drain me for all have and that's not really good

930,Dating again is making my anxious attachment go into overdrive,"Tldr: I can’t tell if this is my anxiety making me overthink and be on the lookout for potential abandonment or if he’s truly not interested or maybe this is just how normal people are? 

Matched with a guy on hinge at the beginning of August and we’ve been on three dates over four weeks of talking. Great connection, good banter, same kinks (sex is important to me), and so far everything seems headed toward exclusivity. Feels like we’ve been friends forever. He keeps mentioning future plans and that his dog really likes me. He has a weird schedule with late hours (restaurant industry) so we have dates on a weekday, one of the two days he’s off. This week he had to go in on his days off for half days in the morning and said he wouldn’t be available. Totally fine, and I’m not going to make him squeeze me in. We’ll just meet up next week instead. 

He usually doesn’t text until the mid-afternoon which is when he’s already at work, so he’s a weird texter to begin with. He responds almost immediately when I message and seems genuinely interested. I haven’t received any texts where I was confused about his interest. He had originally made comments about how hook ups are easy to find (it’s a huge city) but dating and vibing with someone is harder to find and seemed to imply he was really happy we were vibing so well, so that even though we haven’t had the time exclusivity talk, it feels like that’s where it’s soon to be headed.

However I often won’t hear from him for 16 hours or so when I know he’s off and lounging around his apartment, and the long delay makes me feel like I’m being treated casually which I don’t love. I didn’t hear from him for nearly 22 hours so I reached out to ask about his day and he immediately replied back, long responses, sexted a bit and then I sent two pictures later that night as promised, and he didn’t reply until 12:30am so right as I was going to bed. Who knows. Maybe he was napping or out with friends, so I’ll chalk that up to me overthinking.

The next day, he sent a cute selfie after finishing working, which I always appreciate from the people I’m seeing as a “thinking of you” type of thing. We immediately start chatting about work and whatnot. I asked a question about his work but he disappeared. An hour later, I sent him a cute selfie of my day, as an “oh thought you’d appreciate this!” And it’s been almost 20 hours into the next day, and nada. I just posted on my story and he already saw it. 

And I’m just kind of … disappointed? I understand it’s only been 4 weeks, that he doesn’t owe me anything, but it really felt like we were going to become official soon. I also understand he’s busy  and I’m not the sole person in his life but nothing in 20 hours feels like I’m not even something he’s mildly interested in. If I like someone, I’ll keep in touch.

I was going to ask his “intentions” next time we met up but I think I’m preparing myself for the worst. Maybe this is a gender question, but is this normal for men? Maybe he doesn’t feel a need to be in contact? Admittedly his week was incredibly busy, but he’s watched my story this morning and it’s just disappointing after what were three amazing dates. I’m just going back and forth between being panicked and let down.",x4y51x,36,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/x4y51x/dating_again_is_making_my_anxious_attachment_go/,AnxiousAttachment,1
931,how to keep calm when the person you're seeing is seeing other people?,"hey all, how do you keep calm at the beginning stages of dating when you know the person you're seeing is seeing other people?

I've been seeing this guy for a month. we met on a dating app, have been on four dates and it's been going so well. he always seems so excited to see me. he tells me he has a crush on me and that he really likes me. we've been going out on nice dates, half of which he initiates and plans. he also initiates a lot of physical contact. 

butttt.....on our third date he pulled up his phone to show me something and I saw the hud app on it (it's an app specifically marketed for hookups). my first reaction was that I should distance myself from him, then I calmed down and told myself, hey we're not in a relationship, I've had random hookups before, etc and brushed it aside

it's gotten to the point where I don't really feel comfortable talking to anyone else. I messaged one guy off hinge a week ago and it just felt wrong and I stopped. 

today he cancelled on me bc of an emergency. I checked his dating app profile to see if he's updated it recently and he has and it's kind of sent me spiraling. I was hoping he was feeling the same way as me. now I'm in my head wondering if he actually had an emergency or just made plans with someone else. he's given me no reason to believe he was lying and I know it's irrational, but I just feel so shitty right now

how do you guys deal with this feeling? I just feel sad and shitty right now and my gut instinct is to distance myself from him

EDIT: WOW thank you all for the input! I’ve been reading through everything and have a lot to think about. 

while i know that my feelings are valid, i do realize my want to be exclusive so soon stems from my anxious attachment style, and i don’t want to act on anxious impulses when i’m working on becoming more secure. i’m going to have a talk with him about what we’re both looking for, but will hold off on asking him to be exclusive just yet because i want us to both mutually decide we want that with one another instead of pressuring him into it",x3no82,35,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/x3no82/how_to_keep_calm_when_the_person_youre_seeing_is/,AnxiousAttachment,1
932,Beginning month 5 post breakup with DA.,"Hi. Today marks the beginning of month 5 since my DA broke up with me.

When we initially broke up, the moment it happened I felt some relief because I think my body understood that space was the only way I was going to be able to regulate myself again. We were together for 10 months, it was his first ever serious relationship and at the time we both acknowledged this as a potential lifetime partnership. He left the day after he very suddenly lost his job. He said he needed to spend time alone, figure himself out, discover himself. He couldn't be a partner right now, he couldn't fake being present with me and he didn't want to hurt me. It was cold and disconnected. This is the second time he's blindsided me like this and it was and has been absolutely devastating.  


I've been sitting in heartbreak for a solid 4 months now and have been walking myself through grief. I haven't broken NC since we broke up despite complicated feelings about it. Whenever I fantasize about reaching out to him, everything in my body seizes up and becomes activated again as if to say-""NO. We are not going back to what that was, and we're not approaching them unless significant change and awareness have been demonstrated. No more putting myself through pain that will come from committing myself to a person who is showing me and communicating with me that they are unaware, disconnected, and uncertain about what they want. Absolutely fucking not."" I have listened to that. This breakup was never what I wanted, and I have been with myself on this long enough to feel and imagine what my life could look like if I wasn't constantly preoccupied with trying to manage a relationship with someone who is not emotionally available.  


I feel both that I still love this person tremendously for exactly who they were, and longed (and still long) to deeply know them and love them. I'm heartbroken that there's nothing I can do to change this outcome, and I will not allow anyone to rush me through this grief. It feels far too important. It is the love I have for this person, the love I have and want for myself, and it also feels like a process of integration. I am being informed about who I want to become after this. No one can rush me.

  
I both love and want my ex still, and I can also realize that I was becoming very sick in the relationship we had. I take full responsibility for my attachment style and what is unresolved in me that contributed to that. I am focusing on myself right now in therapy and in CODA.   


There is some part of me that hopes we can find each other again when we're healthier. I feel really vulnerable for saying that and hoping it. I also feel how much peace and quiet there is in surrendering this person, and to this outcome. Trying to maintain this relationship singlehandedly with all of the work I was doing on both it and myself were completely impossible, unmanageable and unrealistic.  


I feel all of it-the love, the wanting, the heartbreak, the grief, and also this peace that I'm realizing I can have as much as I want of if I continue on this path.",x1sjwc,35,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/x1sjwc/beginning_month_5_post_breakup_with_da/,AnxiousAttachment,1

938,My anxiety is triggered when I don't get the exact response I want,"I want to share an observation with you guys.

I grew up with a loving but very sensitive mother who struggled a lot with managing her emotions, so as I got older I learned to look out for even the smallest changes in tone, voice, texting etc. I get stressed out when my partners or people that I'm talking to don't act like I ""expect"" them to - if a person takes a couple of hours longer to reply than usual or has a ""different"" tone than usual when I talk to them, I convince myself that they don't like me anymore. I've gotten much better at not engaging in protest behaviours that affect people in my life directly (like spamming them with texts or berating them) but my mind is racing every time and I find it hard to make it stop and self-soothe.A guy I've been talking to replied to my invitation to hang out with a yes, but it was not the eXaCt SpECiFIc way i wanted him to say yes so now i have of course completely unraveled. He gave me a good answer that should satisfy me and it's STILL not good enough for me. I'm now preparing myself for when he ""inevitably"" ghosts me and it's tiring me out emotionally.

This makes me very sad because I see how unconsciously manipulative I am. I have all these high expectations that people in my life have to meet and these poor people don't even know about it. Then they do something that triggers my anxiety and they don't even KNOW it and now i'm angry/sad and making up stories in my mind. I just want it to stop. I am pretty secure in my relationships with most of my friends and I know that I can get to the same level with romantic relationships, but I don't know how to make it there from here.",rj5pjz,37,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/rj5pjz/my_anxiety_is_triggered_when_i_dont_get_the_exact/,AnxiousAttachment,1
939,A suggestion that has made a huge difference in my journey - actively practicing self-compassion!,"I'm not going to make a huge post about self-compassion / self-love, mindfulness, what they are, and what the point is. 

This [episode on self-compassion from The Ten Percent Happier podcast](https://www.happyscribe.com/public/ten-percent-happier-with-dan-harris/310-the-scientific-case-for-self-compassion-chris-germer) does a good job of talking about those points. I want to instead go very quickly to the actionable items from that episode, something I have been practicing for the past week weeks, which has been genuinely game changing for me. 

I will start by saying that I have a *very* difficult time practicing self-compassion. This is a regular note from my therapist - that whatever topic I bring in to my sessions as a concern or something I want to work on, one of the first things she says to me is that I am ""still being too hard on myself"" and need to ""give myself some compassion.""

These are the things that have helped me the most, as an anxiously attached person:

* First is experiencing whatever negative feeling is coming at me. The guy I am dating doesn't respond the way I expected him to. I am having several weeks of terrible or non-existent dates. I don't feel secure or loved in my more important relationships. There's doubt swimming everywhere. Whatever it is, there is an *event* that happens, and there are *feelings* pouring in. 

* To combat it, I first have to acknowledge that I am feeling it. This is important. Not just angrily wailing at myself, ""UGH I hate this"" or ""I feel like crap"" or ""this response is bullshit."" It is pausing and saying, ""Ok, I feel like I am being ignored. That's what this feeling is - I sent him a text that he would normally have responded to by now, and he isn't, and I am feeling ignored.""

* The next part is reminding myself that somewhere out there in the world, another human is feeling exactly this feeling. The nice thing about a lot of AA negative emotions (for me anyway!) is that these feelings aren't exactly unique. It is *easy* to imagine that someone else is right now at this moment feeling ignored. Feeling abandoned. Feeling neglected. So I remind myself that this is happening, that there is someone else feeling the same horrible way I am feeling, and I tell myself that *I am not alone*. 

* The last part, and this can be weird, and it can be really hard to do - and if it feels like too much at first, then I recommend starting with the language part and then adopting the physical part later - you are going to self soothe! It comes in 2 parts. The first is identifying where in your body you *feel* the bad feeling you are experiencing, placing your hand there, and physically patting/rubbing that spot. For me this space is at the base of my throat - I have a whole theory about this. The second part of this is then (either in your head or out loud) saying very gentle, calm, nice things to yourself. ""Yeah, this feels bad. This is not how you want to feel right now. It is hard to feel ignored. It is hard to feel like someone you care about is ignoring you. You want attention. You want to be seen. You want to be comforted. This is not easy. I get it."" Again, if it seems a little ridiculous to do the physical part first, rubbing/patting a part of your body, then at least try to say very kind nice things to yourself :)

You may find that it is easier to bully yourself than to say kind things to yourself. ""Come on, get over it! This is STUPID and that's a stupid emotion and you should *feel better* and not feel so stupid about some dumb emotion. *Get over it.*"" A friend of mine can struggle with this, and much in the same way that you can speak kindly to yourself, you can also speak to this part of yourself and say, ""Hey - chill. I get that you are frustrated. I get that you think this is unreasonable to feel this way. And those feelings are valid. But they aren't helping right now. They just make me feel more stressed. I need to calm down right now.""

I get that all of this seems really silly. And practicing it can feel silly, too. But if there is anything that I have learned on my AA journey it is that healing my internal security systems has been the greatest help of anything I have done before. 

I strongly recommend listening to the podcast episode to get a deeper idea about what I'm talking about. 

And, of course, the next time you are feeling that AA rise up, consider speaking kindly to yourself.",qdp7zo,36,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/qdp7zo/a_suggestion_that_has_made_a_huge_difference_in/,AnxiousAttachment,1

941,Mindfulness meditation + Cognitive Diffusion + Reshaping thoughts!,"So I've finally cracked it!

**Mindfullness**

Mindfulness meditation isn't simply about focusing on your breath. 

It's more about noticing any thoughts that come in. And whenever you see a thought simply originating into your mind, you focus on something else, such as your breath. 

It's very important to kill the thought just as it originates; otherwise it'll take over and destroy you.

And you must practice it throughout the day. Keep asking yourself after every hour, Am I being mindful.

**Cognitive diffusion**

Every hour, write this down:

'I notice that I'm thinking ...'

When you distance yourself from your thought, you take away their power from you.

Now respond as if a friend told you about this thought.

**Reshaping thoughts**

After noting a thought, reshape it. 

In fact, start to reshape every negative thought into a positive one.

942,Do people with anxious attachment get incredibly upset when others don't validate their feelings?,"When I told my therapist about how upset I feel when people are blunt and don't validate my feelings, she asked if my parents didn't validate my feelings when I was younger. I responded that I remember my parents would get frustrated if made mistakes or didn't understand things right away, try to fix things for me...or panic and yell at me in the name of anxiety, fearing that I'd make things worse than they were. My therapist also said my mom projects all of her anxieties and fears onto me. My mom's good friend asked me if I was ""emotionally neglected"" when I was younger, since I sought validation from others, in the form of texting anxiety.

In my case, it was bad enough to the point where I'd get angry at online strangers who were blunt (instead of sympathetic) towards me; they weren't even immature trolls at all! Bad enough to the point where I cried over a professor who was rude to me...even though he was condescending and unapproachable towards *everyone* who wanted his help at office hours. Bad enough to the point where I cussed out an acquaintance via texting, 6 months after interacting with him; when he responded that he was sorry for hurting my feelings, and wanted to politely talk things out with me, I was so touched I cried to him over the phone and felt incredibly guilty.

My therapist told me that people who I have a connection or relationship with (friends, family members) are expected to validate my feelings. She then said other people I'm not close to (coworkers, police officers) will be less understanding towards me. She also said people online don't know everything about my circumstances, and the internet should be used for finding knowledge - not putting myself out there. Her advice was more effective than generic advice such as, ""Why spend energy on people who don't even think about you - or even know you?"" Applying her advice to the present and the future will be reasonably doable for me...but applying it to painful memories from the past will be harder; I'm still working on that.",nka9ph,35,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/nka9ph/do_people_with_anxious_attachment_get_incredibly/,AnxiousAttachment,1

preoccupied. It reminds me so much of the pain that I have gone through in the last relationship. 

I am so scared of going back into my old anxious self. I actually try to convince myself how it is not worth the pain being in a relationship.

948,Advice on Finding Comfort In Between Dates with New Romantic Partner,"Curious if anyone else here has gone through this or has any advice? I have been dating a guy I met on Tinder for about 3 months now. We are both exclusive but due to his crazy schedule (works weekdays and has a contracting side hustle on weekends for the next several months) we only get to see each other once a week, sometimes once every two weeks. It also doesn't help that he is very spontaneous with dates making them last minute, where I like to plan things minimum several days in advance. When we first starting dating this didn't bug me and I would go with the flow, but now that I like him it's causing me really bad anxiety.

&#x200B;

When we are together, it feels perfect. I can tell he is genuinely interested in me (and visa versa) and we have a great time. He is wonderful at opening up and being emotionally intimate, and is overall an awesome guy. But as soon as he leaves all of my anxiety comes flooding back, to the point where I feel de-stabilized and can't focus on work or hobbies. I hate when people's advice for anxiety is ""just focus on your own hobbies and life,"" because I have an amazing life full of meaningful work and hobbies, but despite that I can barely focus on any of it as soon as I don't know when I'm going to see him next or where this is going. I've tried so hard to develop self soothing techniques, but none of the typical advice has worked for me. I also can't tell the difference between dating red flags and imaginary ones created by my anxiety.

950,Falling for breadcrumbing,"I've made a massive amount of progress in moving towards secure attachment but I'm still vulnerable to breadcrumbing.

The anxious avoidant trap is basically an addiction for the anxious person and it's hard to quit any addiction cold turkey. I've been asking for my needs more often and gotten better at upholding my boundaries and my FA has stepped it up slightly as to not lose me completely. But he's still not working on himself so he's still only doing the bare minimum.

I know I'm probably ultimately gonna have to walk away but it's been hard to leave precisely because he has been making some progress. After avoiding admitting that he loved me for over a year he finally said it. (Though it caused him to pull away for a while after he did.) He's been meeting more of my requests. But because he's not working on his avoidant attachment it's at a glacial page. I've just been focused on healing myself, and continued dating other people because we're in a situationship. 

We broke up & I didn't talk to him for 3 months in the winter so he started realizing I wasn't gonna chase him anymore when we break up and he started coming in a lot closer for about 2 months. But then since admitting he loved me he's been more distant. 

We run in same social circles & run into each other a lot and in past I just couldn't stop myself from reconciling when I saw him. But something important happened recently, I ran into him on my birthday when he had not responded to my texts for a week, and I just avoided him. It was the first time I just successfully avoided him all night when I ran into him. It was a baby step in ending the trap but an important one. 

Now that I've done it once I'll be able to do it again. Relapses are normal. Rome wasn't built in a day. Little changes in behavior like this add up & one day I'll be healthy enough to be able to walk away or he'll either step up or walk away because I'm sticking to my boundaries of what I need in a relationship.

Edit: I realized this week my lover is an FA leaning DA & not a DA. At first I wondered if he was an FA but he's so heavily avoidant I just assumed he was a DA. But since he admitted he loved me after a year of our situationship I'm realizing that nope he's an FA which explains why he's very hot & cold & swings erratically between being very present and disappearing.

It was a mess - I was so preoccupied with everything he did, he felt so claustrophobic, and my life reduced to something so small centered entirely around him. I was resentful of the amount I put into our relationship (cooking, cleaning, emotional and logistical labor, pet care) while he invested in friends and hobbies. I was so anxious all the time, I could barely leave my home. I tried everything I could to convince or manipulate him into being the partner I wanted. I thought I had to earn his love, and he occasionally took advantage of my willingness to do basically anything for his approval. During covid lockdown, these problems multiplied and we resented each other so deeply that we finally attended couples therapy - where a counselor told us to break up. I thought that was bullshit, but my ex agreed. He told me it was over and I had to move out.

I was devastated. I had no life outside of him and our pets (who I now had to leave behind). I moved across the country to start a new job in a brand new city and started piecing my life back together.

It was fucking HARD. All I wanted was to go “home” - to our house and our relationship. But I spent a year investing in my hobbies, my friendships, and my healing and avoiding dating entirely. I made plenty of mistakes and had to detach from other unhealthy relationships along the way - I realized my AP tendencies held me back in every area of my life, not just romantically. But I found a sport I loved and friends to do it with. I started making (bad) art and got comfortable with creating something for the simple joy of being creative. I moved into my own apartment and made it a beautiful space just for me. It was like my life before was in black & white, and now I was finally living in color. I had never realized the extent of my unhappiness until I was finally content.

Then I started dating again, and anxiety flooded back. I was worried all the joy I had cultivated was contingent on staying single. But I trusted in myself and my newfound community and continued trying to learn about myself through dating. I learned I was capable of weathering rejection, of saying “no” to what didn’t serve me, and communicating my anxiety in healthy ways to my partners. My dating anxiety never disappeared, but it stopped consuming me.

Two years after my breakup I’m in a relationship with someone communicative, thoughtful, and secure. I still get anxious, but I’m able to self-soothe most of the time. When I’m not, my partner and I have calm, considerate conversations about what we both need. I feel deeply secure in our mutual love and respect AND secure that if we had to separate for any reason, I’d ultimately be okay. 

For the first time, I haven’t lost myself. I have a new understanding of love that leaves room for both togetherness and independence.

Two years ago this felt impossible to me. But investing in myself paid off. If you’re somewhere like where I was, please know a happier life is out there and you deserve to find it.",118dzug,33,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/118dzug/hope_for_aas/,AnxiousAttachment,1

955,How to regain dignity after humiliating relationship?,"I recently got out of a 7 month relationship where I was walked all over and disrespected the most I’ve ever been disrespected in my life. Aside from him being super late to many of our dates, being extremely possessive and jealous, and refusing to wear protection during sex, I found out he was constantly cheating on me (also without protection) and therefore telling me bold faced lies for the majority of our relationship about who he was with and where he was and why he was so late to see me all the time.

Not to mention being yelled at by him in front of his coworkers and friends, and manipulated into not blaming him or feeling angry at him.

I feel the most stupid because in the end he turned everything around on me and made it seem like I was the bad guy for not being able to “let go of the past” and “move forward” to trust him again. So he broke up with me. Like I was some broken toy. 

I know you’re wondering why I stayed, well I only found out about the cheating 5 months in, and then the last couple months were just him love bombing me & blaming me. So I figured everything was my fault and he’s actually the perfect boyfriend. 

Anyway I’ve learned so much from this experience and can’t wait to move on with my life. 

But I have a hard time moving on knowing that I accepted all that disrespect for that long and , that he truly believes he didn’t do anything wrong and that I’m the crazy one.

956,Question for avoidants about connection and space,"I have seen a lot of posts from people who lean FA or DA and it seems the main thing they need is space (lots of space) and not too much communication/interaction (ie. not too much texting, talking, meeting up).

For me, I think maintaining and growing the connection in a romantic relationship is important.  I would say that communication and interaction help maintain that connection.  It doesn't have to be every hour, every day but enough that you still feel like there's a bond (not co-dependency) and a purpose to why two people are together in a relationship.

Since I look at connection through the lens of someone who's somewhere between secure and anxious, I'd like to ask avoidants for their take.  If you like a lot of space and minimal communication and interaction, how do you view connection?  Are you able to maintain the level of love/like for your partner even though there's not much interaction?  Is it that you compartmentalize space and the relationship as two different things so taking space doesn't affect how you view the relationship?  So when you take space and pull back, it doesn't necessarily mean that your feelings change?

I guess I'm curious because when my partner really pulls back on the texting and meetups, I wonder ""doesn't he miss me?"" and I think trying to understand how avoidants view connection would be helpful so I don't create stories or questions in my head.",zpsbku,34,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/zpsbku/question_for_avoidants_about_connection_and_space/,AnxiousAttachment,1

958,Am *I* the drama?,"Yes. Yes I am. I was helping a friend out with an issue with their relationship today and I gave them excellent advice event if I say so myself.
THEN I realised,,,, I should’ve given myself that advice.
When my anxiety is at an all time high, my partner having a life of their own made my brain go “OK SO I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I knew it. They’re subtly telling me that. HOW CAN ANYONE ELSE MAKE THEM HAPPY. How can ANYTHING else make them happy” and I acted out. I demanded. I protested. I yelled, I screamed. I just wanted to feel needed. 
I don’t want to anymore. I want to feel like I’m worth WANT and not need because that’s when I honour myself and my partner. I learn to want them not need them.
I ruined that relationship (admittedly, he helped too) but wow. At least I can learn from this.
I cleared my entire day out for him, when he couldn’t make plans I lost it. I yelled at him. Had a breakdown. Had an anxiety attack. Resented him. Convinced myself he doesn’t want me. 

None of that was true. NONE of it.

If you’re going through something similar, this is a reminder. Honour yourself and honour your partner.

959,Are healthy partners kind of boring?,"I recently started seeing this guy. He seems really nice and sweet, all the green flags, etc. but I’m finding myself kind of bored. Is this normal? It’s been three dates and I am feeling like I am not sure there is a spark at all. I enjoy being around him and the time we spend together, but I don’t feel any kind of desire to kiss him or do anything further than that. 

I’ve read that people claim that when you feel a strong connection/spark that it is likely going to turn into a toxic relationship so I’m feeling confused. 

I was with my ex for almost ten years. I almost feel like I can’t even imagine being intimate with anyone else even though he and I have been broken up for almost two years. I feel really stuck. I’ve never felt this before, I’ve always felt very attracted to people and now I just don’t feel that very much at all. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? I don’t want to write this guy off because I’m in my head about everything and in a funk. But I also don’t want to waste this person’s time either. Can anyone shed some light on these complex feelings?

961,Thoughts based on what I recently experienced:,"I don’t think I’ve ever felt more unloved than I have by avoidants in conflict. There is so much lack of empathy that it’s hard for me to wrap my head around. I would never treat avoidants the way they treat me, even if I hated them. 

There needs to be some sort of study on avoidants and empathy, whenever I read about avoidants on here especially, it seems like a handful of you also experience levels of emotional abuse. It sucks how anxious individuals almost always have to put their needs on the backburner while avoidants stonewall. Self-soothing for days, while the other party seems to be loving life, ignoring you despite being open to giving them space… making you feel crazy for having emotions.

963,I feel like I'm finally healing in a significant way. Here's what helped so far.,"I've been lurking in this sub for a while, because I have dealt with anxious attachment all my life. But lately I feel like I have undergone a fundamental change regarding my attachment - both romantic and platonic. (I still have healing to undergo, but I feel like my relationships are healthier, not as anxiety-provoking, and way more fulfilling. Surprisingly, I also don't rely on them as much.) I wanted  to share my thoughts with others who are on the same journey. 

I had this 'epiphany'. Unconsciously, I was waiting for myself to 'fuck up' each potential or actual relationship (and sometimes friendships). I tried to mold myself into someone 'loveable', not knowing that I am loveable *just as I am*. Just because the person I'm into distances themselves from me or doesn't meet my needs, doesn't necessarily mean I have to change or that I've done something wrong. Sometimes, it's just the way they are, or we aren't compatible If I've acted in a secure and respectful way, their behavior is not a reflection on me. I am loveable, a worthwhile person, and I deserve to be loved just as I am. 

I deserve to have my needs met, including my emotional needs. Having needs is natural. You are the only one that can ensure your needs are met. If your partner doesn't, and is unwilling or unable to, you have to decide whether you want to continue with unmet needs or move on, instead of blaming or trying to change the other person. I can only control my own behavior.

What has helped me to heal so far:

* Trauma therapy, specifically EMDR and IFS.
* Self-compassion, being my best friend, and putting myself first, even when it is difficult or I have the impulse to please the other person. Spending time alone and IFS therapy have helped with this.
* Setting boundaries. (I lost quite a few friends with this one, but I was at peace with it because anyone who disrespects my boundaries repeatedly are not good for me or my mental health.)
* Journaling and reflecting on my behavior in relationships and friendships. (Sometimes protest behaviors or people pleasing can be so subtle.)

965,My most secure thought yet: I owned my happiness the whole time,"I had one of the most profound secure thoughts this week. 

>**All of the happy feelings I had felt around other people was generated in my own body first: but attributed to other people.**

and suddenly my fear of losing people evaporated and made sense. If I had attributed my happiness to other people, then of course I was scared. It was like I was losing my ability to ever feel happy again. Codepency makes sense then if I can only have the highest of feelings generated by other people other than myself.

But this whole time those feelings were me, they were always me. I was always happy by myself because those blissful moments were the moments. If I'd allow myself to have those moments by myself with no shame. I too would have those moments. So I tried it out and-

I was right. I could and did and it worked. I took myself to the museum, I took myself to the beach. I enjoyed it and made sure to not shame myself or judge myself and I was happy.

I think one of the scariest things about losing someone is that it feels like the happiness that was associated with them is going with them. A breakup feels like I’ll never be able to do the codependent things with them. Let alone why you never did it without someone else around. You could of just did it for yourself the whole time. So naturally it is like you are losing a part of your ability to feel those things when you are codependent. But that happiness was within you the whole time. You already proved it to yourself when you were with them. Its just that it was misattributed to them

It's easy to own the negative emotions for me. I can control and take responsibility for my sadness and anger. It makes me feel in control, like no one can hurt me anymore. But sometimes it's even harder to admit that I was responsible and generated my happiness the whole time.",uxx7ne,32,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/uxx7ne/my_most_secure_thought_yet_i_owned_my_happiness/,AnxiousAttachment,1

It’s all just too much. There are times when I think I’ve got a great handle on things and then something happens that brings all those thoughts and feelings racing back and I’m back at square one.

But then if I break things off, after a while I get super lonely. Like, I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. And yes I’ve been in therapy for more than 10 years for related and unrelated things, and I currently still am.

Will this internal fight ever stop? Please be brutally honest with me. I’m just so sick of myself.

Edit: just wanted to add that when a short relationship does end (which it always has for me; I’ve never had a long term relationship at 32F), I can’t figure out if it’s bc of my behavior (was I too needy? Did he see through me to my low self-esteem? Was it something I did/said/texted? Etc). I can never tell if it’s bc I did something or if they just didn’t like me after all. Or was it incompatibility.

967,I hate the way I get anxious even because of someone who I'm not even in a relationship with. But wish I was...,"How do you deal with that? Being in a relationship is hard, but being single is just as hard because if I like someone, I subconsciously expect them to give me the kind of attention I want. So this guy I like is normally really nice and sweet to me, I know that nothing can happen between us, but yet I got so damn anxious and upset when today he replied to my message with just one word, as if letting me know that he doesn't want to talk. We did have a nice conversation before that. And he is sick and probably doesn't feel great.

So like the thoughts that come through my head are like that:

Oh no, he obviously doesn't want to talk.

He doesn't care.

Hang on, he told me before when we interacted a lot at work that he really likes my company and that he can be a bit mean because that's just the way he is, but he does enjoy our daily interactions.

Hang on, why on earth does it matter at all, we can't be together. So it doesn't matter. Whatever.

Still though, remember all these sweet moments when it was obvious that he likes me too...

Maybe he knows we can't be together too...

Shut up brain. Think about work. It doesn't matter anyway.

970,How do you guys find the will to date after learning about attachment theory?,"I used to be secure. I didn't know it at the time, or atleast I didn't know the term, I knew nothing about attachment theory. But looking back now I can tell that I was pretty secure, only slightly anxious leaning due to the my parents emotionally and financially abusive relationship with each other and us. 

And I had dated before, it wasn't a big deal, I never got carried away. But the last guy. Wow. He was different. He seemed so cool and confident, now I can see all the glaring DA flags but back then, I didn't know any better. We dated for two years. A year and a half in, he cheated on me, both emotional and physical. We parted ways and I felt like I had died. Then he came back, convinced me that he had changed, convinced me that he was here to do the work, that it would be different. 8 months later he told me that his feelings had changed and walked away. He was dating someone new three months later. 

I felt like I had died again. Every day my heart died a little more. And it's taken me 8 months to pick myself up again. The cheating made me so fucking anxious but I worked so hard to get back to being secure. Understanding attachment theory has helped so much, in understanding myself, in understanding him, in understanding all the generational trauma that I've been unknowingly carrying. It's been good overall 

Except when it comes to dating. I feel like a mask has been removed from my eyes, I can see so clearly now. But when I go on dates my mask less eyes can read every red flag like a book. I don't want to make snap judgements, I'll date the person for a couple weeks at least. But it keeps ending the same way. I can tell that they don't have a good understanding of themselves, what they want from the relationship, or how to communicate. It's just a sea of DAs that seem unaware/unwilling to grow.

972,"Dating People Who Seem Open/Vulnerable And ""Secure-Seeming"" But Then Change To Avoidant Behavior","Hi all,

I'm new to reddit and this sub and everything I've been reading has been so helpful! I hope this is an appropriate post to make here and thank you in advance for any thoughts! (Sorry for the long post!)

I (35F) have anxious-attachment tendencies. I've been working on it and in the past several years have been trying to be as ""real"" as I can and communicate effectively from the very beginning of dating someone (despite feeling very anxious the whole time). This has involved bringing up issues from the get-go and asking for behavior changes/tweaks to meet my needs for connection and availability. My understanding is that's a good way to weed out DA people who would just make my anxiety worse. I've mainly dated via online dating apps as an fyi.

The problem I'm facing (and honestly I'm pretty bummed about it) is that I keep attracting men who at first respond well/""securely"" to my openness and my bringing up issues from the get-go (with one person this even lasted several months until I was lulled into a sense of security). They make me feel heard and try to tweak their behavior to better meet my needs (texting more, making plans ahead of time, being verbally expressive, etc.). But inevitably, at some point, their reactions seem to change and they start responding to conversations poorly and with what I believe are avoidant techniques (defensiveness, reacting snarkily to me bringing up issues, suggesting ending the relationship instead of working on things, etc.). And ultimately they end the relationship.

I know this is part of the process of weeding out incompatible people, but some of these cycles play out over months (and one over a year and a half, albeit with a out-of-nowhere break-up in between that was probably a warning sign for me to not have given it a second chance). So by that point, I'm very emotionally invested in them and it really hurts to keep ending up back in the same spot. I'm really losing trust in my ability to differentiate between truly securely attached people and the secure-seeming ones that are somehow ultimately avoidant.

Anyone experience these kinds of relationships? How do you keep going and stay positive?

Is it possible I'm doing something to cause actually securely-attached men to decide they don't want a relationship with me? (I know that's hard to say without knowing more details about me but if anyone else has had similar doubts/experiences, I'd love to hear!).

974,How tell apart genuine mature excitement from naive love bombing,"As most of you, I have had a history of being attracted to avoidants and often (unknowingly) being turned off by healthier and secure, open and affectionate prospects. 

I have done a lot of therapy and self education over the years but as we know some of these things are deep seated and we can always have room for growth. 

My dilemma is: I am worried about my ability to accurately tell apart love bombing vs mature open respectful treatment. 

My main question is: what are some hallmarks of a guy in his 30’s and 40’s who is genuinely excited about you in a healthy and caring way vs. a love addicted delusional way?

I met someone recently we have a lot in common with (we both have some extremely niche interests and world views) but I feel a little turned off and cautious by his level of excitement, openness and kindness (messed up I know, but bear with me). I can’t tell if it’s just my old patterns feeling undeserving to respectful, chivalrous and consistent treatment or if I should genuinely be concerned about love bombing. The fact that I am hesitant and cautious makes me lean more towards him being healthy (I usually don’t feel this skeptical or smothered by dysfunctional love bombers - but what if I have grown and this is a new thing for me to feel this way?!).

I am clingy and all emotional and want more of him the more distant he is with me. I know he's not good for me. I know I could probably find someone else who really cares about me, who wants to be close to me and talk about emotions and share feelings and everything I want from my DA right now.

But I also know that if I find such a person, I will push them away. It happened so many times. I meet a nice guy, he is really interested, gets enthusiastic and BOOM suddenly I feel that yet again, that switch inside me has been turned off. And I just can't help feeling that deep desire to push him away. I feel like an animal that is trapped, and all I can think about is running away or attacking. Its like a physical reaction almost. My head knows that this person is good to me, that they really like me, that they will probably treat me well. But the rest of me just... reacts and I can't help it. It's so damn frustrating. I hate myself when that happens but my urge to protect myself and not let them come an inch closer is so incredibly strong. I have made bad choices because of my attachment style, pushed the good ones away and stayed with the ones who don't treat me well.

I know that I have a problem with communication, that I need to talk about my boundaries before someone accidentally crosses them and my switch turns and there's no going back. I do therapy, and I really wish I could let someone get close to me. I know I have probably treated some people very badly in the past and I have broken some hearts and I hate myself for it. I just want to be loved, like all you anxious people out there. I am desperate for that connection yet I can't allow myself to have it. 

Yesterday I watched a YouTube video of a relationship ""expert"" on FAs and he basically said ""yeah well.. just don't date FAs they are fucked up"". I know he's probably right but that made me so sad.

977,How badly is/was your self-esteem affected by your relationship?,"A common thread I notice amongst AP people, especially those who have or are dating an avoidant person, is a lack of self-esteem. Or, their self-esteem has worsened. It's made me realise just how much we see ourselves is influenced by our partners, and for APs this can really have damaging effects.

I know this was the case for me. And even though I am more secure, I still struggle with the self-esteem part. My DA would really trigger my insecurities when he would invest time and energy into other people and things, but never with me. A common thread is he would refuse to do things with me but then do those same things with others. For example: he always tries to find an excuse as to why we can't travel together and he would have all these excuses about why he prefers to travel alone. Yet he has travelled with friends and with a female friend. Another example, he always says no when I suggest cute dates like going for a picnic or drinking wine and playing a board game. Yet he does those things with others and he also did those things with her. So I always felt left out and felt as if I wasn't good enough. Luckily this isn't my problem anymore as I'm exiting the relationship very soon.

I would like to hear from you guys. What ways is your self-esteem affected by your relationship, regardless of whether your partner is DA.

979,Putting my life on hold for my relationship,"Upon reflection, I’ve realized that I put my life on hold for my relationship. 

I think I do so because I want to be flexible for my partners needs - if he wants to move cities, travel, try something new, etc. I want to make sure my life has the flexibility to jump to whatever it is he wants. It also doesn’t help that he’s very uncommitted to things in life (not to me though!) and likes not having a plan. 

I’m worried because I’m typically known as a really motivated and ambitious person, but now find myself confused and feeling lost in life. 

Maybe this all has to do with a lack of trust I have in myself(?).

981,TAKING A BREAK IN MY RELATIONSHIP,"My partner (secure M) and I (anxious F) broke up in February after dating for a little over a year. The reason: He hit a breaking point with the emotional pain cause by my incessant protest behavior. I was unaware of my attachment style and it wasn’t until this third failed major relationship that I started to do some digging and began learning about AA. I’m now a month into therapy (EMDR) and am genuinely making leaps and bounds due to awareness, self reflection, and constant learning (books, Reddit, videos, etc).

From February-March we continued to FaceTime, text, and hangout from time to time because the breakup wasn’t a result of incompatibility in personality, just in attachment style. Recently I asked him to go 30 days no contact with me in hopes that we can both see the relationship more clearly in that month. The day before starting NC he told me he’s still very much in love with me and wanted me to remember that the only reason he needed to distance himself was so that I could have the space to become more secure (through therapy) and stop hurting him with protest behavior. He then said he has every intention of asking me out at the end of this month of NC. 

We’re almost a week in and it’s been tough for my AA but I’m trying to tell myself that if there is ever a time to be strong and not protest or reach out, it’s now. I want to allow the space to do its job: whether it results in our feelings for each other intensifying or dying out.

983,How do I move on despite the news?,"I just found out on Reddit that my ex is engaged through arranged marriage (we are from a culture where arranged marriage is the norm). 

We were together from June 2021 to February 2022, he broke up with me because he wasn’t over his ex-wife and wanted time to figure things out. A few months later he suggested FWB and I agreed to that. However I wasn’t over him and I only agreed to FWB, because I wanted him to believe our break-up was a mistake. Plot twist: it didn’t happen. 

It was on and off until I told him in February 2023 that I cannot do it anymore. He agreed and went NC. I have co-dependency issues so even though we agreed to it, it was still super hard for me to accept that part. So I unfortunately didn’t respect that boundary - I tried to contact him a few times. 

As I found out about his engagement through Reddit, my mood shifted and my stomach turned. I know he doesn’t want to be with me and it will never happen - it’s already a sign to just move on with my life, but I just can’t help myself but be so sad and unhappy. While he has moved on, I haven’t and that kills me. I feel worthless - we were together while he was still emotional attached to his ex-wife and I didn’t deserve that. I deserved a man who didn’t have emotional baggage. His new fiancée has that version of him being healed and that fills me up with jealousy.

984,I’m scared my boyfriend won’t reciprocate saying “I love you”,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 5 and a half months now. We’ve been exclusive since the beginning, but he didn’t officially call me his girlfriend until 4.5 months in. I know this is a long time, which worries me immensely. He was out of a 1.5 year long relationship about 6 months before dating me, and even before her he was with someone for 5 years. My theory is having long term relationships in his adult life that didn’t work out made him a bit more cautious to dive into another one, although I’ve never really asked him. There’s also the possibility that he just doesn’t like me that much so is hesitant to get serious with me, which obviously I am worried about.

I feel that nearing 6 months together, I’m close to saying I love you meanwhile he only just started calling me girlfriend a month ago. Should I hold off in fear that he is nowhere near ready to hear that or say it back? Our balance between us is already off, as I am significantly into my boyfriend more than he is into me. Part of me feels that he likes that, but then part of me feels like I shouldn’t be in a relationship where the basis of it is he likes the attention from me and not just likes me.

I’m not ready to say it yet anyway, I honestly felt more ready last month but due to anxieties about our relationship I held off and now my anxiety is pretty bad so I’m definitely not ready yet again. I want to wait until I’m in a good place mentally.

Should I be worried that if I make that large next step he will get weirded out by it and/or run? I’m not sure if I am mentally capable of saying I love you and not hearing it back, which is a huge reason I’ve put it off.

Back then i would protest and hope for the best outcome when I was triggered. But it never worked. So now I hang in anxious limbo flip flopping once more between ""I want this to work"" to ""I cant take this, this person is causing me too much distress and I need them gone"".

It's very Buddhist in my opinion, very much like ""stop fighting reality and allow people to be who they are and you will find peace and love inside yourself."" Part of the book involves challenging thoughts you had about various people. When I questioned my thoughts about my previous partner, I kept coming to the same conclusion: I feel incomplete. I need my partner to text me more/include me more/praise me more/validate me more because otherwise I feel incomplete.

To describe it a bit more - it's not that I don't have a sense of myself. I know what I enjoy and I actually operate quite well alone (so long as I'm not actively thinking about missing anyone). It's more like a feeling of emptiness, like I was born with half a soul and the only way I can think to resolve this feeling is to merge with another person. The feeling underscores almost everything I do. I feel afraid to do things on my own because I feel like I don't have all the resources to handle myself since I am only a half person. I feel afraid to meet new people because I feel like they won't like me once they figure out I'm only half a person.

988,Just had a catch up video call with my (presumed avoidant) ex," Just journaling a bit my feelings in the aftermath.

We haven't seen each other in little over a year ( we moved to different countries, which was why we broke up since he didn't want to commit to anything further). I asked him for a few months of NC back then, saying I'd get back in touch when I felt ready. So I grieved and missed him, and a few months later reconnected. We've been texting sporadically, once a month/couple of months we send lengthy voice messages to update each other or ask/give travel advice. I just returned to a country where I can video call, so we had a 3 hour catch up.

It was very nice. He's still jobless and aimless and lost in life, but in good spirits. He showed me the two lovely cats he's petsitting at the moment. Conversation was lively and interesting, lots of questions and stories and laughter from both sides, and happily reminiscing some moments we shared.

I admit I feel a bit melancholy now - we always greatly enjoyed each other's company and it would be nice if we lived closer and were able to spend time in person. He was always perfectly nice and pleasant with me, even though there was no romantic future due to his lifelong inability to commit and maintain a relationship, so - romantic side notwithstanding - I do miss having him in my everyday life. I'm still very fond of him, he sounds genuinely still very fond of me.

It is, within the limits dictated by distance and by his extreme avoidance, a nice friendship. Without much contact and I know he could never provide any support if I needed it, but we know each other well and have similar interests, so it's always interesting to talk about a variety of things. Too superficial for me to count him as a 'true' friend, if you know what I mean, but pleasant nonetheless for what it is.

It's a bit bittersweet, I suppose; knowing he's a genuinely nice person who is chronically unable to have any romantic / deep relationship. I determined even before we broke up that he wasn't the person I wanted as a partner for my life, but that doesn't mean I didn't care for him or value his company. I know it was the right choice - it was the only possible choice - but I still think very fondly back on the time we had together. I still have one of the flowers he regularly picked to surprise me with, he really was sweet despite his limitations regarding relationships.

I'm going to stop rambling now. I'm glad to have come to a point where, if the other person is genuinely a good person who treated me well, I'm able to let go of a romantic connection that doesn't work but still maintain a genuine friendship.

I almost never think about him these days, but tonight I'm going to allow myself some time to miss him.

989,A few reminders for those who need to see,"Have compassion for yourself if you reach out to your ex or feel ashamed of missing them. It's normal to grieve a bond and you're practically fighting an addiction if this was a relationship based on intermittent reinforcement


If your partner was avoidant and left you, it's not a reflection of you. Unless you did something that's worthy of a break up (harassment, name calling, stalking people they know, snooping through their phone without permission or no true reason to do so, overall trampling over boundaries etc), there was nothing you could've done to prevent them from leaving. It was just a case of incompatibility 


 You're not weak for having needs and wants. It doesn't automatically make you clingy, you're allowed to have standards and requests in relationships that will help you to feel safe and secure 


 It may not feel like it now, but there's always someone else out there who is ready to meet your needs in ways exes in the past have not.

990,"How do you get over that ""used"" feeling?","I feel utter disgust (with myself mostly) being vulnerable with someone, only to be dropped like a hot potato. It feels like they ""won"" and I ""lost"". Relationships shouldn't be viewed like this. It's not a game. But I can't help but feel it is. 

I can't tell if my exes ever liked me or if I was just ego fodder. One of them said ""sorry, Im too quick to use the words I love you"" after he cheated on me and I felt crushed. But when I asked him if he actually did love me, he said yes (ofc I didn't believe because if he did, he wouldn't have emotionally abused me. Which he basically admitted to doing) 

With this last one. He was nice to me. He did favors that still benefited me in a massive way (he helped me pass math classes in highschool, if he didnt, I wouldve had to repeat 12th grade). So it's not like he actually used me if I benefited too. However, with him pulling away so suddenly after intimacy again, I feel disposable. 

It's even worse when he begged me not to just leave him and to try to talk things out. Yet when I tried, nothing worked. He'd either fold and tell me I deserve better, or just ghost me. I could never tell what he really wanted from me or if he genuinely cared. 

I have a history of dealing with people who'll do nice things for me just because they wanted something. My dad is a prime example, he would buy me a ton of things I didn't need solely so I couldn't call him out for being abusive.

992,Needs,"In past relationships I know I have not advocated strongly enough for my needs , and then after pushing them down for a long time eventually the love deteriorates.

Common advice for APs is to be clear about asking for needs to be met. 

I think a missing piece is that, you can't demand for needs to be met on the spot. From conversations I've had with people who I think are likely secure,  the "" I need this , now"" request or demand makes anybody clam up a bit. There's a built in high probability of failure and no free will. 

I know during my own AP panicking I can reach out for reassurance or support from a partner then immediately get disappointed when it isn't there for me in that instant. And my mind wants to blame or label that person as being emotionally unavailable. 

So I think the advice needs to be more nuanced or it's setting people up for disappointment.

Another month has passed. I feel better, but I still have my days. I'm slowly starting to accept the fact that we will never speak again. I'm still dealing with a lot of guilt. Perhaps I should have given her the ""break"" she wanted. I also feel ashamed of not ""moving on"" fast enough. 

The biggest mindfuck when being with an avoidant is the complete lack of conflict. We never had a fight or anything...then BAM blindsided.

This whole thing really left a bad taste in my mouth. The pain, and the suffering, it's different than my previous breakup. It's more intense, more acute, and harder to get rid of.

I still have so many questions for her, but I know she probably doesn't even have the answers.

997,Ghosting anxiety,"Hi everyone, glad to have found this group on here. I'd like to share my story and get insight and support from those who may have experienced similar. Please be easy on me, this journey is very new :( I'm embarrassed and ashamed of a lot of how I acted/reacted in this. BUT it is helping me realize what a problem this is for me. I am currently in therapy and have been for years, although focusing on my anxious attachment is new for me.  


Due to a lot of trauma and past life things, like all of you I'm sure, I've just never had healthy romantic relationships. My anxious attachment problems have extended into my friendships but much less than those that are romantic. For the last year I have been dating around, meeting people on apps mostly.  


Last December I met a man and we instantly connected so well. We had a lot of fun together, texted every day, had a great first date. Then we had a second date where we ended up sleeping together. After that, he completely fell off the face of the earth. Due to sexual traumas in my childhood and being anxious in general, this really really fucked me up. I mean, I think it would fuck up most people but you know we get the extra feelings. I accepted it..moved on..tried to date new people to forget him, like just covering the pain and not really dealing with it. In March he texted me out of the blue saying he lost all of his contacts shortly after we saw each other. I was like ok well it's nice to hear from you, asked him a question, and he never responded. Fastforward to last week, we ended up matching on Bumble again. He responded to me and we started texting and he apologized and made me feel like he really wanted to move forward and be something. We went on a date, then went to his place and ended up hooking up again. We discussed how I did not want casual sex or a fwb situation. He agreed, told me how he is ready to find a relationship, that he was interested in what we had and wanted to keep it going. We cuddled all night and I thought this is finally ok now. I felt SO validated that he did not just leave me originally bc of something wrong with me, which is something I kept in my heart for months. It must have been me.  


The next day, the texting got less..I figured he was tired bc he works 14 hour days. I expressed the next day how I was feeling unsure about us because of how things went down last time. I wasn't pushy or clingy I just wanted him to know. I felt like I had the right to express that and get reassurance that he wasn't going to do this again. I just asked if he still wanted to see each other again. He never gave me a straight answer. He said it was reasonable to feel unsure and understandable. He said ""Let me think about this and get back with you tonight."" He never got back to me. The next day I did what I always do and I apologized. I said I got into my own head too much and I honestly didn't even need to bring it up. I still feel kinda stupid and like I should not have brought it up. He never responded to me. And I haven't heard from him since. Ghosting is terrible on a normal day, but to be ghosted twice, for an anxious person, is excruciating. I sometimes feel like I need to just ignore my feelings and act like everything is ok while I'm dying inside because I don't want to be ""too much"" for someone.  


And with this I realize I need to learn self soothing strategies and REALLY focus on what is keeping me obsessing about people leaving me. Like even if everything is fine, I will ruminate about when they're going to abandon me. I almost sometimes wonder if I self sabotage. But it seems impossible sometimes not to say anything. Any advice or support is welcome. I feel awful.",wrk1po,33,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxiousAttachment/comments/wrk1po/ghosting_anxiety/,AnxiousAttachment,1
