### Conclusion

- A linear regression model is trained with 9 key features.
- These features include: transaction year, floor area, age of HDB, full flat type, nearest distance to MRT, nearest distance to mall, postal sector, distance to CBD, and mid storey.
- With this model, 89% of the variations in resale price can be explained by the features, with Â±$48000 price difference.

### Recommendations

1. Improve prediction score
 - Explore other factors (e.g. impact of cooling measures on resale price)
 - Explore other machine learning models

2. User Testing
- Test and improve app usability with focus groups

3. Public Launch
- Campaign launch to educate housing finance planning with calculation.
